Popular spatial models are predominantly reaction-diffusion equations of Fisher-KPP type. However, Brownian motion that leads to a constant diffusion coefficient is a rough first approximation to fish behaviour. For two species of reef snapper, around 5% of the population (rangers) travel much further than the majority (home-stayers). This is not explainable by linear diffusion. Possibilities of improved mobility models include density-dependent mobility, Gaussian mixture models and non-Brownian Levi processes with long-tailed distributions. The resulting densities satisfy nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations of fractional or integer order. Exact solutions can be obtained for the interior of a no-take area (NTA) with lethal boundary conditions that represent over-fishing in the exterior. This gives exact expressions for the critical domain size for survival in the NTA.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75348' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk388' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(388)' class='star'><span class='star388'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM (D408)</b> Masaya Yasuda, Lattice Basis Reduction and Its Application to Cryptanalysis <span id='bitlink-358'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(358)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-358' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(358)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Lattice Basis Reduction and Its Application to Cryptanalysis</b><br />Masaya Yasuda<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-86.html'>Mathematics for Industry in the Asia Pacific Area - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>The security of modern lattice-based cryptography relies on the hardness of solving lattice problems, such as the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest vector problem (CVP). Lattice basis reduction is a strong tool for solving lattice problems. Given a basis of a lattice, a reduction algorithm is to find a new basis of the same lattice whose basis vectors are relatively short and nearly orthogonal each other. In this talk, I introduce several reduction algorithms, such as the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) and the block Korkine-Zolotarev (BKZ) algorithms that are popular in cryptanalysis. I also describe mathematical properties of such reduction algorithms and demonstrate how a reduction algorithm can solve lattice problems.

Among other types of uncertainty they faced are knowledge uncertainties, natural uncertainties, and decisions to be made under uncertainties.  In an oil refinery, uncertainties in the supply and product demand cover all aspects of uncertainties. This talk will present how stochastic programming parameters be estimated to help oil refinery planners make decisions when the supply and demand in the industry are hit by the rapid fluctuations in oil prices. The fluctuations in oil prices and unstable product demands result in disruption at procurement, production, and inventory stages. The parameters and the types of uncertainties involved in this project were identified through literature and discussion with industry practitioners. Then, an accurate forecast is required to quantify the uncertainties in the oil prices dependent on the behaviour of its volatility.  In this talk, the successful implementation of the project will also be highlighted.

For a differentiable multivariate function into $\mathbf{R}^p$ with $p \geq 2$, its Reeb space is the space of connected components of its fibers. This is a generalization of the notion of Reeb graphs for univariate functions in the case of $p=1$. It has been known that Reeb spaces are often very useful for visualizing the given multivariate function. In this talk, we generalize the Reeb space in such a way that it captures more of the topological features of the fibers, not only their connected components. This theoretical part essentially relies on the global singularity theory of differentiable maps between manifolds developed mainly by the author. Such techniques have been used for efficiently visualize large scale data. If time permits, we will also discuss an application to multi-objective optimization problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75348' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

In such fluid-structure systems, it is common for the intrinsic timescales of the fluid and structure to differ, sometimes by orders of magnitude. However, it can be challenging to decouple these time scales in conventional IB formulations of fluid-structure interaction (FSI). This talk will outline a new sharp-interface approach to FSI that leverages a coupling scheme based on the immersed interface method. We use a penalty method to couple the fluid and structure that makes it straightforward to advance fluid and structure variables at different time step sizes, and we investigate the impact of multi-rate schemes on the accuracy and efficiency of the methodology in a range of benchmark cases and large-scale applications.

By using a regular Cartesian grid that is independent of the geometry, the IB framework yields a robust scheme that can efficiently handle immersed deformable structures. The IB method has also been adapted to problems with prescribed motion. IB methods for these problems traditionally involve penalty forces or they are formulated as constraint problems. In the latter approach, one must find the unknown forces by solving an equation that corresponds to a poorly conditioned first-kind integral equation. This operation can require a large number of iterations of a Krylov method, and since a time-dependent problem requires this solve at each time step, this method can be prohibitively inefficient without preconditioning. In this talk, we introduce a new, well-conditioned IB formulation for flows with rigid bodies, which we call the Immersed Boundary Double Layer (IBDL) method. In this formulation, the equation for the unknown boundary distribution corresponds to a well-conditioned second-kind integral equation that can be solved efficiently with a small number of iterations of a Krylov method without preconditioning. Furthermore, the iteration count is independent of both the mesh size and boundary point spacing. Additionally, while the original constraint method applies only to Dirichlet problems, the IBDL formulation can also be used for Neumann problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75810' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1677' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1677)' class='star'><span class='star1677'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (E105)</b> Thomas Fai, Lubricated Immersed Boundary Method with Application to Fiber Bundles <span id='bitlink-1537'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1537)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1537' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1537)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Lubricated Immersed Boundary Method with Application to Fiber Bundles</b><br />Thomas Fai<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-371.html'>Immersed Boundary and Related Methods: Advances in Methodology and Biological Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Fluid-mediated near contact of elastic structures is a recurring theme in biofluids. The thin fluid layers that arise in applications such as the flow of red blood through blood vessels are difficult to resolve by standard computational fluid dynamics methods based on uniform fluid grids. A key assumption of the lubricated immersed boundary method, which incorporates a subgrid model to resolve thin fluid layers between immersed boundaries, is that the average velocity of nearby boundaries can be accurately computed from under-resolved simulations to bridge between different spatial scales. Here, we present a one-dimensional numerical analysis to assess this assumption and quantify the performance of the average velocity as a multiscale quantity. We explain how this analysis leads to more accurate formulations of the method and present examples from two-dimensional simulations, including applications to filament bundles.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75810' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1678' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1678)' class='star'><span class='star1678'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (E105)</b> Amneet P.S.

Most commonly, the VP method is used to solve FSI problems, although it has also been used to solve scalar advection-diffusion PDEs. The original VP technique was inspired by Brinkman's work and treats solids embedded in a fluid as porous media. The velocity boundary condition on the fluid-solid interface, which is of Dirichlet type, is imposed through a volumetric feedback force that is inversely proportional to the penalty parameter $\kappa$. Since both fluids and solids are represented on a single Eulerian grid, the VP method can be implemented in parallel codes much more easily than the dual grid (Lagrangian-Eulerian) IB method.       
VP method research has largely focused on understanding the accuracy of the penalized Dirichlet solution. There is a little research on (1) developing efficient solvers for the volume penalized fluid solvers, especially when the system becomes stiff as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$; and (2) imposing spatially varying Neumann and Robin boundary conditions on geometrically complex interfaces. In this talk we discuss recent advances in the VP method that address both of these issues.      </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75810' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1679' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1679)' class='star'><span class='star1679'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (E105)</b> Yunchang Seol, A Discrete Leray Projection for Solving a Semi-Implicit Immersed Boundary Method in a Staggered Grid <span id='bitlink-1539'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1539)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1539' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1539)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Discrete Leray Projection for Solving a Semi-Implicit Immersed Boundary Method in a Staggered Grid</b><br />Yunchang Seol<br />Monday, February 27 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-371.html'>Immersed Boundary and Related Methods: Advances in Methodology and Biological Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>In many real-world applications involved with interaction problems between a fluid and an immersed interface, the effects of high inertia and elasticity are very important. In this talk, we present an efficient and stable immersed boundary (IB) method for solving the motion of elastic interface, in particular, when the fluid has high inertia and the interface has strong elasticity.    
Our contributions are three folds. First, an iteration-free semi-Lagrangian approach is used in Navier-Stokes equations so that the high inertial effect of fluid is more stably simulated. Second, the elastic interfacial force is treated semi-implicitly allowing to handle strong elasticity and also to construct a resulting linear system. Last but not least, in solving the original linear system, we transform the 3-by-3 block matrix to a reduced 2-by-2 block matrix after eliminating the fluid pressure term. Such rank reduction is possible by applying the discrete Leray projection operator in a staggered MAC grid. By virtue of this feature, we call our method as a reduced immersed boundary method (rIBM). The equivalence between the rIBM and the original problem is proved in a theorem. Then an efficient algorithm for finding two unknowns is suggested using the Schur complement. We provide numerical results which show that the proposed rIBM improves both the numerical stability and the computational speed when solving more realistic problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75810' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

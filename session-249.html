From a pure computing perspective, algorithms are required to cope with stagnating or even decreasing per-core speed and increasing on-chip parallelism. These and other showstopping trends will continue and already led to research on partly disruptive mathematical and algorithmic reformulations of dynamic cores, e.g., using (additional) parallelism along the time dimension.    
This presentation provides an overview and introduction of a selection of the following promising newly developed and evaluated time integration methods for equations related to prototypical dynamical cores, all aimed at improving the ratio of wall clock time vs. error: Exponential Integration, Rational Approximation of Exponential Integration (REXI), Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time (PFASST) and Semi-Lagrangian methods combined with Parareal. We get improved time-vs.-error rates, but sometimes with additional challenges on the way which need to be further overcome. Overall, our results motivate further investigation and combination of these methods for operational weather/climate systems.

Therefore, it is of great importance to develop coarse time stepping schemes that are able to improve the stability and convergence of PinT methods. In this work, we explore the application of semi-Lagrangian exponential methods for the two- and multilevel parallel-in-time simulation of the shallow water equations (SWE) on the rotating sphere, using Parareal and MGRIT. As a main feature, exponential methods (e.g. ETDRK) solve exactly the linear terms of the governing equations, and their recently proposed semi-Lagrangian version (SL-ETDRK) was shown to be more stable in the serial integration of the SWE on the plane. We then consider these methods on the sphere and in the PinT context. We perform stability studies on a linearized ODE which indicate that Parareal and MGRIT using ETDRK and SL-ETDRK as coarse schemes have improved stability properties compared to the use of the well-known SL-SI-SETTLS method, which turns out to be highly unstable in the PinT framework despite of its successful application in serial simulations of atmospheric circulation. Numerical tests of standard benchmarks confirm that exponential schemes, notably in the semi-Lagrangian framework, are promising choices for parallel-in-time integration.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75575' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1135' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1135)' class='star'><span class='star1135'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (G109)</b> Jemma Shipton, Towards Parallel in Time Methods for Compatible Finite Element Discretizations of the Shallow Water Equations <span id='bitlink-1049'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1049)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1049' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1049)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards Parallel in Time Methods for Compatible Finite Element Discretizations of the Shallow Water Equations</b><br />Jemma Shipton<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-249.html'>Parallel-in-Time Algorithms: Performance and Real-World Applications - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Compatible finite element methods are of interest to the weather and climate modelling community due to their conservation and wave propagation properties on non-orthogonal meshes such as the cubed-sphere. These non-orthogonal meshes allow for better scaling from spatial domain decomposition than meshes based on the latitude-longitude grid which have grid points clustered at the poles. However, parallel scaling is still limited by the sequential timestepping schemes commonly used in these applications. Here I will present recent progress towards investigating various parallel in time algorithms for compatible finite element disrectisations of the shallow water equations. I will describe an exponential integrator that can be computed in parallel using a rational approximation and show how this can be used to construct a coarse propagator for the parareal algorithm. I will also outline how this can be extended to equation sets used to model vertically stratified flows.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75575' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1136' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1136)' class='star'><span class='star1136'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (G109)</b> Joshua Hope-Collins, Application of ParaDiag to Finite Element Atmospheric Models <span id='bitlink-1050'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1050)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1050' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1050)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Application of ParaDiag to Finite Element Atmospheric Models</b><br />Joshua Hope-Collins<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-249.html'>Parallel-in-Time Algorithms: Performance and Real-World Applications - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Numerical weather prediction involves solving very large simulations on an operational schedule. This requires vast amounts of computing power, so highly scalable algorithms are essential on massively parallel modern hardware. The ParaDiag method achieves this by exposing time parallelism, in addition to the spatial parallelism exposed by traditional domain decomposition.    
We present recent progress on the application of ParaDiag to finite element discretisations of PDEs for atmospheric flow, which are particularly challenging for time-parallel methods due to their hyperbolic nature. These solvers are implemented as an open source general library using Firedrake, an automated code generation framework for the solution of finite element methods.    
Various ParaDiag formulations are explored, including quasi-Newton iterations and the preconditioned Newton-Krylov method, and their parallel scaling is compared. The performance of ParaDiag is compared against theoretical convergence estimates. We describe our approaches to the solution of the block systems within the ParaDiag matrix and show how these can be realised within the library.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75575' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1137' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1137)' class='star'><span class='star1137'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (G109)</b> Shubham K.

The method relaxes data synchronization between processing elements (PEs) at a mathematical level, allowing computations to proceed regardless of communications status. Recently, we developed an asynchronous discontinuous-Galerkin (ADG) method, which can provide accurate solutions in the absence of data communication and/or synchronization. As the arrival time of messages between PEs is random, the latest available time level at the buffer nodes near PE boundaries is also random. This makes the update equations at the boundary elements of the PDE solver stochastic, posing a challenge in analyzing the stability properties of the underlying schemes using standard methods. In this work, we develop a novel Fourier stability analysis coupled with the eigen-decomposition of the amplification matrix to analyze the properties of schemes based on the ADG method. We investigate errors incurred in terms of dispersive and dissipative nature. Unlike the standard DG method, where the stability properties depend on the schemes as well as the simulation parameters like grid spacing and time step, we show that the properties of the ADG method can also depend on the number of PEs used and the amount of delay in communication. Our analysis results show that the ADG schemes are stable but with stricter CFL conditions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75575' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

One specifics of this approach is that it requires  the full square   multiple-output/multiple-input (MIMO) matrix valued transfer function as the data for the multidimensional problems.  The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) however is limited to the single input/single output (SISO) measurements corresponding to the diagonal of the transfer function.  We present  a ROM based   Lippmann-Schwinger  approach overcoming this  drawback. It also simplifies  the data-driven computations of the internal field by formulating it as a composition of  Gram-Schmidt transformations on the known background field.  Our algorithm  allows us to obtain the solution of the nonlinear inverse scattering problem at the cost of the linearized Born method however suppressing multi-scattering artifacts such as ghost echoes. Efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated on 2D and 2.5D numerical examples.

We give conditions under which the linearized problem is injective, including in cases where some of the imposed voltages may leave some resistors with zero current traversing them. The approach is inspired by the Bal uniqueness proof for certain linearized continuum inverse problems with internal functionals. The same approach can be applied to a discrete version of the Schroedinger problem and is illustrated with numerical experiments.

Spectral imbedding of graph-Laplacians provides a low-dimensional parametrization of the data manifold which makes the subsequent task (for example, clustering, with k-means or any of its approximations) much easier. However, despite reducing data dimensionality, the overall computational cost may still be prohibitive for accurate clustering of large data sets.    
In this talk we present a novel multi-level divide-and-conquer approach for clustering of big data sets. At each level, independent clustering tasks are performed for small data subsets. Unlike conventional greedy graph coarsening algorithms, the crucial part of our approach is efficient clustering of each of these subsets (target subsets) that ensures the consistency of subset clustering with the clustering of the full data set (if one would perform such). To achieve this goal we construct a low-dimensional representation of the original graph that respects important distances between the vertices of the target subset. Our main tool is the so-called reduced-order graph Laplacian that approximates these distances with spectral accuracy. Numerical results will be provided to illustrate the performance of the approach.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75238' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk124' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(124)' class='star'><span class='star124'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (D408)</b> Bilyana Tzolova, Machine Learning and Computational Methods for Blood Flow in Organs <span id='bitlink-117'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(117)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-117' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(117)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Machine Learning and Computational Methods for Blood Flow in Organs</b><br />Bilyana Tzolova<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-27.html'>Reduced Order Models for Applications in Graphs and Inverse Problems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>Mapping the vascular system in the liver organ helps practitioners with diagnosis, treatment, and surgical planning. There is growing interest to use deep learning techniques to more efficiently and effectively model the vascular system and to use computational methods to provide insight to the flow of blood in the organ. Using PocketNet paradigm, we create a 3D neural network for vessel segmentation on CT images. From these segmentations, the blood vessels are skeletonized and their centerlines are computational domains for reduced 1D models while the liver is converted to a 3D mesh to be the simulation domain. Using the 3D liver and the 1D vasculature we model the flow of solute from the vessels into the liver using finite element method. Such automation of vessel segmentation and simulation of flow modeling can be translated into the clinical setting to improve patient outcome and care. This is particularly beneficial for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma where the delivery of chemotherapy to hepatic tumors can be modeled.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75238' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

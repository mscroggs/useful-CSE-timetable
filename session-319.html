<h2>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1447' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1447)' class='star'><span class='star1447'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (D503)</b> Miklos Kresz, Graph Theory and Combinatorial Scientific Computing: Review and Perspectives <span id='bitlink-1331'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1331)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1331' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1331)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Graph Theory and Combinatorial Scientific Computing: Review and Perspectives</b><br />Miklos Kresz<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-319.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>Problems on the discrete side of scientific computing are solved by  various means. Sometimes we use well developed solvers like LP or  SAT. And sometimes we develop specialized algorithms, as general  solvers may have drawbacks like speed or robustness. In the course of  developing such algorithms graphs and graph theoretical approach  appear more and more often.    
In some cases graph emerge naturally as obvious models. In some  chemical related problems the chemical structure represented by graph  structure. Distances measured and clusters searched in network models  for roads, social interactions or chemical interactions in complex  systems as our body.    
In other cases graphs used as a modeling language alike numbers, and  thus graph models could represent hidden relationships far from  obvious. For analysis of the stock market the market graph is build  from pairwise temporal correlation of stock price.   Auxiliary graphs can represent scheduling problems,  protein docking sites and many more.    
In this talk we will review the state of the art methodologies in the  above sense with a special focus on algorithmic  complexity. Concentrating on hard problems we will highlight the  modeling expressivity as well as the efficiency of different  algorithmic engineering approaches. We will also outline the potential  approaches for future research trends.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75715' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1448' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1448)' class='star'><span class='star1448'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D503)</b> Henning Meyerhenke, Faster Greedy Optimization of Resistance-Based Graph Robustness <span id='bitlink-1332'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1332)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1332' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1332)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Faster Greedy Optimization of Resistance-Based Graph Robustness</b><br />Henning Meyerhenke<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-319.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>The total effective resistance, also called the Kirchhoff index,  provides a robustness measure for a graph G. We consider the  optimization problem of adding k new edges to G such that the resulting  graph has minimal total effective resistance (i. e., is most robust).  The total effective resistance and effective resistances between nodes  can be computed using the pseudoinverse of the graph Laplacian. The  pseudoinverse may be computed explicitly, but this takes cubic time in  practice and quadratic space. We instead exploit combinatorial and  algebraic connections to speed up gain computations in established  generic greedy heuristics. Moreover, we leverage existing randomized  techniques to boost the performance of our approaches by introducing a  sub-sampling step. Our different graph- and matrix-based approaches are  indeed significantly faster than the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm,  while their quality remains reasonably high and is often quite close.  Our experiments show that we can now process large graphs for which the  application of the state-of-the-art greedy approach was infeasible  before. As far as we know, we are the first to be able to process graphs  with 100K+ nodes in the order of minutes.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75715' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1449' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1449)' class='star'><span class='star1449'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D503)</b> Deepak Ajwani, Learning-to-Prune: A Machine Learning Framework to Speed Up Combinatorial Optimisation Algorithms <span id='bitlink-1333'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1333)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1333' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1333)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Learning-to-Prune: A Machine Learning Framework to Speed Up Combinatorial Optimisation Algorithms</b><br />Deepak Ajwani<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-319.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>In a large number of industrial applications, combinatorial optimization  problems are repeatedly solved with datasets from similar distribution. In  recent years, machine learning techniques have been shown to be quite  effective in speeding up such computations. However, black-box end-to-end  machine learning approaches suffer from poor interpretability and the  requirement for a large amount of labelled data. In this talk, I will  present a simple and highly effective way to incorporate the insights from  the algorithmic and optimization literature on these problems into a  machine learning framework to speed-up the solutions of these problems. We  considered a range of optimization problems: Steiner trees, travelling  salesperson problem, k-median and set cover. These problems are well  studied and a number of algorithms have been designed for these problems.  We look at the kind of quantities these algorithms employ and use these to  derive useful features for training a classifier that helps quickly reduce  the problem size by identifying the difficult core of the problem and  pruning the remainder. The difficult core is then solved using an Integer  Linear Programming (ILP) solver. A prime advantage of using such features  is that we do not require much data to train the classifier. This results  in algorithms returning a better trade-off between running time and  solution quality compared to commercial ILP solvers.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75715' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1450' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1450)' class='star'><span class='star1450'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D503)</b> Uros Cibej, Structural Analysis of Unsatisfiable Cores for a Combinatorial Problem <span id='bitlink-1334'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1334)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1334' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1334)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structural Analysis of Unsatisfiable Cores for a Combinatorial Problem</b><br />Uros Cibej<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-319.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>Our work deals with the problem of searching for small subsets in the set $[n]=\{1\ldots n\}$ that do not contain any arithmetic triplets (i.e. elements $a,b,c$ (sorted) such that $b-a=c-b$). Furthermore, the set has to be saturated in the sense that if any other number from $[n]$ is added to the subset, it forms an arithmetic triplet with (at least) two other numbers. We are interested in empirically computing the smallest such subset and finding interesting properties in the process. Instead of crafting our solver for this particular problem, we opted to construct an encoding to the SAT problem and use state-of-the-art solvers to solve it. We further explore Minimal Unsatisfiable cores (MUS) to see what interesting properties could be extracted from them. We generated all the MUSes for small $n$ and observe vast differences in the number of MUSes both for different sizes as well as different encodings. These expressions were then transformed into graphs and we explore their structural properties. We emphasize the main differences and connect them with the semantics of the original problem. The main goal was to compute a set of graph properties and see how they behave, and how they change in various contexts. By using common data-exploration techniques we identified interesting patterns and we connect these patterns through the increasing size of the problem. We present the results of this exploration and show the potential of such analysis for other similar problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75715' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1451' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1451)' class='star'><span class='star1451'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (D503)</b> Beno&#238;t Loucheur, Graph-Based Matrix Completion Applied on Weather Data <span id='bitlink-1335'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1335)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1335' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1335)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Graph-Based Matrix Completion Applied on Weather Data</b><br />Beno&#238;t Loucheur<br />Wednesday, March 1 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-319.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>Low-rank matrix completion is the task to recover unknown entries of a matrix from partial observations by assuming that the true matrix admits a good low-rank approximation. Sometimes additional information about the variables is known, and incorporating this information into a matrix completion model can lead to a better completion quality. This information between the column/row entities of the matrix is expressed as a graph.  In our work, we are interested in the network of automatic stations of the Royal Meteorological Institute (RMI) in Belgium, which provides temperature measurements at 10-minute intervals. We evaluated the effectiveness and importance of good spatial and temporal graphs for improving the completion of missing data in these meteorological data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75715' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

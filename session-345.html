In the 15 years that have followed, GPUs have become widely adopted for many general purpose computations in computational science. And yet, there is still an ongoing debate whether "GPUs are worth it" from a productivity point of view. This talk revisits various technological developments in the GPU landscape over these 15 years. Based on the lessons learned from the past, current developments and promises are evaluated in order to derive an outlook on where computational science using GPUs is headed.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75757' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1565' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1565)' class='star'><span class='star1565'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (E103)</b> Joachim Schoeberl, High-Order Cell Methods for Maxwell Equations on Accelerators <span id='bitlink-1438'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1438)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1438' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1438)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High-Order Cell Methods for Maxwell Equations on Accelerators</b><br />Joachim Schoeberl<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-345.html'>Recent Developments on GPU-Based Solvers in High-Performance Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>We present recent advances of the linear operator algebra of the finite element package NGSolve.   Matrix-free high order finite element discretizations, preconditioners, or explicit time stepping methods can be expressed by the composition of matrices of various types.  Since in many cases it is cheap, the operators are built on the host system, and the whole tree of matrices is moved to the accelerator. As a case study we consider symplectic time stepping methods for Maxell equations discretized by high order cell methods. The matrices from the differential operators are universal for all elements, and mass matrices are block-diagonal with very small, order independent block sizes. Time domain PML leads to coupled ordinary differential equations, which can all be expressed by operator composition.  We present our in-house cuda-based implementation to dispatch the operator tree to GPUs, but similar concepts are portable to other popular linear algebra libraries.

In addition to allowing the programmer to hide launch and memory transfer overhead, streams enable extracting additional parallelism by executing multiple tasks simultaneously. However, streams have proven difficult to integrate into libraries as they break the otherwise natural encapsulation offered by functions. This mini-symposium reports recent progress and developments on safely integrating a performant stream-aware programming model in PETSc.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75757' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk2074' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2074)' class='star'><span class='star2074'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (E103)</b> Yen-Chen Chen, Batched Tridiagonal and Banded Solvers on GPUs <span id='bitlink-1899'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1899)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1899' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1899)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Batched Tridiagonal and Banded Solvers on GPUs</b><br />Yen-Chen Chen<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-345.html'>Recent Developments on GPU-Based Solvers in High-Performance Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>GPUs play an essential role in modern numerical computation. Solving large-scale sparse linear systems on GPUs is one of the most studied HPC topics. The batched solvers are a particular set of methods that aim to leverage the most performance on solving multiple linear systems of the same density pattern. This work implements batched sparse direct solvers for batched tridiagonal and general band linear systems on GPU architectures. The implementation demonstrates a large speedup over the latest cuSPARSE and cuBLAS routines. The presented work will be embedded into the Ginkgo library in the near future.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75757' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1568' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1568)' class='star'><span class='star1568'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (E103)</b> Jakub Klinkovsk&#253;, Development and Optimization of a Coupled Multi-GPU LBM-MHFEM Solver for Vapor Transport in the Boundary Layer over a Moist Soil <span id='bitlink-1440'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1440)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1440' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1440)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Development and Optimization of a Coupled Multi-GPU LBM-MHFEM Solver for Vapor Transport in the Boundary Layer over a Moist Soil</b><br />Jakub Klinkovsk&#253;<br />Tuesday, February 28 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-345.html'>Recent Developments on GPU-Based Solvers in High-Performance Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>We present an efficient computational approach for simulating component transport within single-phase free flow over a soil layer. A numerical model based on this approach is validated using controlled experiments in a climate-controlled low-speed wind tunnel that is interfaced with a soil tank to study problems of heat and mass flux across the land-atmospheric interface.  The numerical model is based on a combination of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) formulated for a weakly compressible fluid flow and the mixed-hybrid finite element method (MHFEM) for solving constituent transport. Both of these methods individually, as well as when coupled, are implemented for execution entirely on a GPU accelerator in order to utilize its computational power and avoid the hardware limitations caused by slow communication between the GPU and CPU over the PCI-E bus. Furthermore, domain decomposition and optimization techniques are used to balance the load and communication costs when using multiple GPUs on an HPC cluster.    
We describe the numerical method and implementation of the solver, focusing primarily on the coupling mechanisms and performance optimizations. The performance of the solver is studied on Nvidia A-100 GPUs within the Karolina supercomputer managed by IT4Innovations, Czech Republic. Flow and transport simulation results are shown and compared with experimental data measured in the wind tunnel.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75757' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

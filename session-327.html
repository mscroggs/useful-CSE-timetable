Nevertheless, the majority of neural operator applications has thus far been data-driven, which neglects the intrinsic preservation of fundamental physical laws in data. In this paper, we introduce a novel integral neural operator architecture, to learn physical models with fundamental conservation laws automatically guaranteed. In particular, by replacing the frame-dependent position information with its invariant counterpart in the kernel space, the proposed neural operator is by design translation- and rotation-invariant, and consequently abides by the conservation laws of linear and angular momentums. As applications, we demonstrate the expressivity and efficacy of our model in learning complex material behaviors from both synthetic and experimental datasets, and show that, by automatically satisfying these essential physical laws, our learned neural operator is not only generalizable in handling translated and rotated datasets, but also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency as compared to baseline neural operator models.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75730' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1485' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1485)' class='star'><span class='star1485'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (E108)</b> Ugo Galvanetto, On the Surface Effect and the Imposition of the Bc in Peridynamics <span id='bitlink-1364'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1364)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1364' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1364)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On the Surface Effect and the Imposition of the Bc in Peridynamics</b><br />Ugo Galvanetto<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-327.html'>Nonlocal Models in Computational Science and Engineering</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Peridynamics is a non-local continuum theory: two interrelated problems affect it at the boundary of the domain: the “surface effect” and a difficulty in the imposition of the boundary conditions. Since the points near the boundary are characterised by an incomplete neighbourhood we observe an unrealistic variation of the stiffness properties in the most external layers of the domain, the surface effect. Two main methods are used to correct it: the definition of modified bonds in the external layers of the domain or the introduction of a fictitious layer of nodes around its boundary.  The imposition of the boundary conditions is often achieved by using a fictitious layer, in the case of displacement bc, or by distributing the external tractions as body forces applied to a certain number of nodes on or close to the boundary. Imposing the boundary conditions as one would do in a local model, generates large fluctuations of the solution. There is no general agreement on the way to “distribute” the boundary loads or displacements over some finite layer.  We will present 1-2-3D examples of the application of a recently proposed version of the “Taylor-based extrapolation method” that makes use of the nearest-node strategy. The method uses a fictitious layer of points around the body where the displacements are determined as functions of the displacements of their closest true nodes by means of multiple Taylor series expansions. The examples will include as well dynamic cases.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75730' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1486' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1486)' class='star'><span class='star1486'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (E108)</b> Raymond S.

This makes the efficient solution of nonlocal models a challenging task. In this presentation, we will discuss on-going research into assembly using hierarchical matrices and algebraic multigrid solution techniques that are suitable for nonlocal models.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75730' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1487' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1487)' class='star'><span class='star1487'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (E108)</b> Alexander Hermann, A Hybrid Meshfree Discretization to Improve the Numerical Performance Of Linearized Peridynamic Elasticity And Corrosion Models <span id='bitlink-1366'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1366)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1366' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1366)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Hybrid Meshfree Discretization to Improve the Numerical Performance Of Linearized Peridynamic Elasticity And Corrosion Models</b><br />Alexander Hermann<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-327.html'>Nonlocal Models in Computational Science and Engineering</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>The numerical computation of spatial integrals is crucial in determining the accuracy and efficiency of peridynamic models. In this work, we propose a meshfree discretization scheme based on a collocation approach, which takes a significantly smaller number of neighborhood nodes as compared to the classical particle-based scheme, in order to achieve a certain accuracy while maintaining the same length scale. Our proposed discretization procedure is employed within the regions of the computational domain, where the field variable can be approximated by smooth basis functions inside the neighborhood. In the hybrid approach, our method is then combined with the classical scheme, the latter being applied within the regions subject to discontinuities and material damage. We illustrate the increase in efficiency of our proposed discretization scheme due to the reduced number of neighborhood nodes and evaluate the convergence behavior. As numerical examples of the hybrid approach, we adopt the brittle fracture problem by means of bond-based peridynamics as well as the peridynamic corrosion model in two and three dimensions, respectively.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75730' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

We discuss two methods for enabling such analysis. In the first, the resolvent analysis optimization problem is formulated in a space-time setting, and is then modified to include an L1-norm term to promote temporal sparsity. The resulting optimization problem can be formulated as a nonlinear eigenproblem, which in turn can be solved numerically using a generalized inverse power method. In the second approach, forcing or response modes are assumed to take the form of Gabor wavelets in time, allowing for resolvent gains to be computed as a function of wavelet parameters. We relate the two approaches by demonstrating that temporal wavepackets with this structure (corresponding to Fourier modes modulated by Gaussian envelopes) naturally emerge when applying the sparsity-promoting methodology. We additionally demonstrate that this assumed temporal structure can be analyzed analytically in certain situations. Results from both approaches will be compared for statistically-stationary turbulent channel flow, and for a turbulent Stokes boundary layer, where the mean velocity profile varies with time.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75390' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk521' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(521)' class='star'><span class='star521'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (E103)</b> Taraneh Sayadi, Data-Driven Reduction of Chemical Input-Output Libraries in Simulations of Hypersonic Flows in Non-Equilibrium <span id='bitlink-480'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(480)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-480' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(480)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data-Driven Reduction of Chemical Input-Output Libraries in Simulations of Hypersonic Flows in Non-Equilibrium</b><br />Taraneh Sayadi<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-114.html'>Reduced-Complexity Models for Fluid Flows - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Hypersonic flows are of great interest in a wide range of aerospace applications and are a critical component of many technological advances. Accurate simulations of these flows in thermodynamic (non)-equilibrium (accounting for high temperature effects) rely on detailed thermochemical gas models. While accurately capturing the underlying aerothermochemistry, these models dramatically increase the cost of such calculations. In this paper, we present a novel model-agnostic machine-learning technique to extract a reduced thermochemical model of a gas mixture from a library. A first simulation gathers all relevant thermodynamic states and the corresponding gas properties via a given model. The states are embedded in a low-dimensional space and clustered to identify regions with different levels of thermochemical (non)-equilibrium. Then, a surrogate surface from the reduced cluster-space to the output space is generated using radial-basis-function networks.  The method is validated and benchmarked on a simulation of a hypersonic flat-plate boundary layer with finite-rate chemistry. The gas properties of the reactive air mixture are initially modeled using an open-source library. Substituting the library with the light-weight, machine-learned alternative improves the performance of the solver by 50% while maintaining overall accuracy.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75390' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk522' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(522)' class='star'><span class='star522'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (E103)</b> Sean Symon, Unravelling the Linear and Nonlinear Mechanisms in Flow Around a Stalled Airfoil <span id='bitlink-481'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(481)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-481' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(481)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Unravelling the Linear and Nonlinear Mechanisms in Flow Around a Stalled Airfoil</b><br />Sean Symon<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-114.html'>Reduced-Complexity Models for Fluid Flows - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>The Navier-Stokes equations linearised around the mean (time-averaged) flow can successfully identify the energetic frequencies in variety of flows. One particular example is the flow around a stalled airfoil where linear analysis identifies two important frequencies: the vortex shedding in the wake and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the shear layer. Although the frequencies are a good match with experimental data obtained from particle image velocimetry (PIV), the structures computed from linear analysis do not agree with those computed directly from the PIV data. The discrepancy can be explained by the limitations of the linear analysis which only accounts for energy exchange mechanisms between the mean and fluctuations. Inter-scale energy exchanges are neglected resulting in structures which extend too far into the wake. In this talk, the nonlinear energy exchanges are unravelled by isolating the key triadic interactions underpinning the flow. In addition, the regions of the flow where these nonlinear energy exchanges take place are identified in order to develop suitable eddy viscosity models that mimic nonlinear energy transfer.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75390' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk523' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(523)' class='star'><span class='star523'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (E103)</b> Katherine Asztalos, Physics-Based and Data-Driven Models for the Response to Momentum-Injection Actuation on a Stalled Airfoil <span id='bitlink-482'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(482)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-482' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(482)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Physics-Based and Data-Driven Models for the Response to Momentum-Injection Actuation on a Stalled Airfoil</b><br />Katherine Asztalos<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-114.html'>Reduced-Complexity Models for Fluid Flows - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Active flow control techniques can be useful for improving the performance of aerodynamic structures, such as by providing transient lift enhancement, or mitigating the effects of flow separation or airfoil “stall”. This work employs data-driven and physics-based modeling techniques to capture and predict the response to burst-type momentum-injection actuation near the leading edge of a stalled NACA0009 airfoil, utilizing data from direct numerical simulations. The response to this type of actuation can be decomposed into two components: a short-time response that is characterized by an initial decrease followed by an increase in the lift, and a long-time response that can be sensitive to the instantaneous wake state at the onset of actuation. Theoretical models are developed using assumptions from classical unsteady aerodynamic theory, which provide insight into the form that the data-driven models should take. The data-driven models, which are identified using variants of dynamic mode decomposition, are capable of capturing both the short- and long-time response of the system to actuation. We additionally show how physics-based approaches can extract spectral content from systems with limited data available, with applications for vortex interactions in wake flows.

The widely used principal component analysis (PCA) achieves this for combustion data by transforming the original thermo-chemical state space into a low-dimensional manifold with eigenvectors of the data covariance. However, this may not effectively capture the stiff chemical dynamics when the reaction zones are spatiotemporally localized. Alternatively, a co-kurtosis PCA (CoK-PCA), wherein the principal components are obtained from singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matricized co-kurtosis tensor, demonstrated greater accuracy in capturing the stiff dynamics. However, both methods incur significant errors due to a linear reconstruction of data onto the original manifold. Nonlinear methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) can improve reconstruction accuracy over linear methods, thereby allowing further dimensionality reduction of the original manifold. We use homogeneous reactor data of premixed ethylene-air to investigate (1) the efficacy of CoK-PCA-ANN relative to PCA-ANN and (2) ANN reconstruction relative to linear reconstruction by comparing reconstruction errors of the thermo-chemical state, species production, and heat release rates. Our results show that, while ANN outperforms linear reconstruction in general, the proposed CoK-PCA-ANN captures the stiff dynamics better than PCA-ANN.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75390' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

In order to investigate these rare structures, the gamma-rays emanating from the target must be reconstructed from recorded spectra. The partially complete spherical shells of high-purity germanium (HPGe), GRETA (GRETINA) and AGATA, represent the state-of-the-art in gamma-ray spectroscopy. GRETA is able to capture individual gamma-ray-matter interactions and their energies allowing the reconstruction of the scattered paths of individual gamma-rays that have undergone Compton scattering. However, current methods for reconstruction recover gamma-rays with an efficiency much lower than predicted and lower than older detectors (i.e., Gammasphere). Data-driven optimization using modern machine learning (ML) methods allows for more reliable separation of multiple gamma-rays and ordering of their interactions. Additionally, ML methods are used to improve existing metrics to better differentiate between high and low quality data and employ more computationally intensive methods only when needed. These methods, in conjunction a mixed integer non-linear program formulation, allow for increased efficiency of the ion-beam approaching the predicted efficiency for AGATA and GRETA as well as enabling further scientific investigations into rare isotopes.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75611' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1224' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1224)' class='star'><span class='star1224'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (D301)</b> Victor Watson, Using Machine Learning to Optimize the Performance of the Superconducting ECR Ion Source Venus <span id='bitlink-1135'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1135)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1135' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1135)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Using Machine Learning to Optimize the Performance of the Superconducting ECR Ion Source Venus</b><br />Victor Watson<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-269.html'>Optimization of Particle Beamlines</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>The fully-superconducting electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source VENUS is key to providing both the high-intensity, medium-mass ions needed for the superheavy element science program and the very-highly-charged ions for the chip testing program at the 88 Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The success of this source has led to the construction of a VENUS replica as primary injector source at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University: a facility that will serve at the forefront of Nuclear Structure research for decades to come. At LBNL a Python library has been developed to communicate with the VENUS programmable logic controller (PLC) to monitor and fully control the ion source programmatically. This permits a variety of data analytics and machine learning techniques to be applied to enhance and facilitate the operation of the ion source. In this talk, the physics, mechanics and control of the ion source will be discussed. Some initial results demonstrating how techniques such as bayesian optimization and neural networks enable a better understanding, automatization and output stabilization will be presented.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75611' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1225' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1225)' class='star'><span class='star1225'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (D301)</b> Angel Ferran Pousa, Multitask Optimization of Laser-Plasma Accelerators Using Simulation Codes with Different Fidelities <span id='bitlink-1136'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1136)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1136' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1136)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multitask Optimization of Laser-Plasma Accelerators Using Simulation Codes with Different Fidelities</b><br />Angel Ferran Pousa<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-269.html'>Optimization of Particle Beamlines</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Laser-plasma accelerators can generate GeV electron beams in an ultra-compact, cm-scale setup, but have yet to demonstrate sufficient beam quality and stability for demanding applications. To overcome this challenge, broad optimization of the accelerator design with numerical simulations is essential. However, due to the high computational cost of general particle-in-cell simulations, optimization over a large parameter space is prohibitively expensive. Here, we show that cheaper simulations based on reduced physical models can be effectively incorporated into an optimization to strongly reduce the need for fully-detailed simulations. This is enabled by a Bayesian optimization algorithm using a multitask Gaussian process, where two tasks corresponding to the output of each simulation code are defined. The algorithm identifies correlations between both tasks, allowing it to learn from inexpensive evaluations and perform only a few, well-targeted simulations of high fidelity. By means of a proof-of-principle study combining the FBPIC and Wake-T codes, we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in computing time and cost, paving the way towards cost-effective optimization over wide parameter spaces.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75611' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1226' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1226)' class='star'><span class='star1226'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM (D301)</b> Jeffrey Larson, Numerical Optimization of Secondary Beamlines at the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System <span id='bitlink-1137'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1137)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1137' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1137)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Numerical Optimization of Secondary Beamlines at the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System</b><br />Jeffrey Larson<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-269.html'>Optimization of Particle Beamlines</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Physicists at the Argonne National Laboratory's ATLAS In-Flight Facility seek automated optimization processes for the production and delivery of secondary beamlines. Secondary beam production relies on a primary beam provided by ATLAS to impinge on a production target, generating numerous new and interesting radioactive ions. A selection of the isotope of interest is first made, and then optimized (for yield, purity, and beam quality) from the production point to the experimental target. In this talk, we highlight approaches for utilizing numerous outputs from beamlines in order to decrease the number of experimental setups required during an optimization campaign.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75611' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1227' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1227)' class='star'><span class='star1227'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM (D301)</b> Camille Carvalho, Quadrature by Parity Asymptotic eXpansions (QPAX) for Light Scattering by High Aspect Ratio Plasmonic Particle <span id='bitlink-1138'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1138)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1138' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1138)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quadrature by Parity Asymptotic eXpansions (QPAX) for Light Scattering by High Aspect Ratio Plasmonic Particle</b><br />Camille Carvalho<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-269.html'>Optimization of Particle Beamlines</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>The study of scattering by a high aspect ratio particle has important applications in sensing and plasmonic imaging. To illustrate the effect of particle's narrowness (that can be related to parity properties) and the need for adapted methods (in the context of boundary integral methods), we consider the scattering by a penetrable, high aspect ratio ellipse. This problem highlights the main challenge and provides valuable insights to tackle general high aspect ratio particles. We find that boundary integral operators are nearly singular due to the collapsing geometry to a line segment. We show that these nearly singular behaviours lead to qualitatively different asymptotic behaviours for solutions with different parities. Without explicitly taking this into account, computed solutions incur large errors. We introduce the Quadrature by Parity Asymptotic eXpansions (QPAX) that effectively and efficiently addresses these issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QPAX through several numerical examples (potentially including high-order QPAX results).

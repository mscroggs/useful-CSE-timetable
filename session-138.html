These methods are based on well-established physical and statistical models. Consequently, they are well-interpretable and performance bounds can often be derived. However, modeling errors, oversimplifications, wrong statistical assumptions, or insufficient model knowledge may severely degrade the performance of model-based approaches, and incorporating empirical statistics of possibly available data is usually difficult. Data-driven approaches can resolve some of the aforementioned issues. However, they usually suffer from huge data hunger, and they typically lack interpretability. Some of these problems may be tackled by incorporating model knowledge into data-driven methods, which is a major challenge with lots of open research questions.    
In this talk, we will present model-inspired neural networks (NNs) for data estimation, which are derived by using deep unfolding. These NNs are designed by unfolding the iterations of iterative model-based algorithms to layers of NNs. We will highlight similarities between model-based methods and model-inspired NNs. For example, we will show that conducting preconditioning, which is known to improve iterative model-based methods, can boost the performance of NNs that are derived by deep unfolding. We will compare these NNs to traditional model-based methods, and highlight their pros and cons.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75427' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk629' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(629)' class='star'><span class='star629'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (Auditorium)</b> Gergo Bogn&#225;r, Variable Projection Networks in Autonomous Driving <span id='bitlink-586'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(586)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-586' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(586)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Variable Projection Networks in Autonomous Driving</b><br />Gergo Bogn&#225;r<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-138.html'>EU-MATHS-IN: Success Stories of Mathematical Technologies in Societal Challenges and Industry, Part I</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Data representation has a crucial role in machine learning (ML), since it influences heavily the performance of these methods. Accordingly, the first step of traditional ML techniques includes data preprocessing, information extraction, and dimension reduction. This can be done manually via feature engineering or automatically via representation learning. There is a trade-off between these two approaches, which is to say, utilizing domain knowledge and promoting handcrafted features results in suboptimal performance, whereas learning representations directly from the data increases the performance, but also reduces the interpretability of the ML algorithms.     
In this talk, we propose VPNet, a novel model-driven neural network architecture by combining variable projections (VPs) and neural networks (NNs). VP is a classical method for solving separable nonlinear least squares problems (SNLLSs) by which we extract features automatically in our learning framework. Note that many inverse problems can be viewed as SNLLS data fitting problems including a small set of adjustable nonlinear parameters with direct physical interpretations.  Thus, VPNet retains the powerful learning ability of ML methods, and the representation abilities of VPs in which both the trainable parameters and the extracted features are interpretable. As a case study, we show the potential of VPNet in road surface classification, which is an important environmental recognition problem in autonomous driving.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75427' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk630' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(630)' class='star'><span class='star630'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (Auditorium)</b> Nicolai Spicher, Examination of a Deep Neural Network for Biosignal Classification Reveals Features Similar to Clinical Criteria <span id='bitlink-587'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(587)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-587' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(587)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Examination of a Deep Neural Network for Biosignal Classification Reveals Features Similar to Clinical Criteria</b><br />Nicolai Spicher<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-138.html'>EU-MATHS-IN: Success Stories of Mathematical Technologies in Societal Challenges and Industry, Part I</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Computer-aided diagnosis of biomedical signals culminated recently in deep learning (DL) methods, often outperforming human experts. However, these methods remain unadopted in clinical practice which is partially due to their lack in explainability. In this talk, we address this issue using electrocardiography (ECG) as use-case.    
We apply a pre-trained DL network for classification of 12-lead ECG signals that has been trained on more than 2 million signals and classify signals from a publicly-available ECG dataset. Additionally, we apply the method 'Integrated Gradients' which assigns a positive or negative relevance to each sample of a classified signals, pointing towards or against the classification; thereby allowing to understand the relationship between model prediction and learned features.    
We compare the relevance values of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation (AF) or left bundle branch block (LBBB) to healthy controls. Results show that the network learned cardiology textbook knowledge: Visible P-waves and concordant T-waves both result in a distinct negative relevance in AF and LBBB classification, respectively. Moreover, the difference in relevance between healthy controls and patients w.r.t. ECG leads is in line with clinical recommendations.    
In summary, our analysis suggests that the network learned features similar to clinical experience. Integrating this analysis in an application could be useful for quality control of diagnosis or teaching.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75427' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk2072' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2072)' class='star'><span class='star2072'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (Auditorium)</b> P&#233;ter Kov&#225;cs, Fusing Model- and Deep Learning-Based Methods for Thermographic Imaging <span id='bitlink-1897'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1897)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1897' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1897)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fusing Model- and Deep Learning-Based Methods for Thermographic Imaging</b><br />P&#233;ter Kov&#225;cs<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-138.html'>EU-MATHS-IN: Success Stories of Mathematical Technologies in Societal Challenges and Industry, Part I</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques offer tools to inspect material parts without causing damage. Thermographic imaging is a specific NDE approach in which the investigated object is heated up by induction, flashlamps, or lasers. After an initial thermal excitation, the surface temperature can be measured with infrared cameras. Inside the object, the temperature evolution in time can be described by the heat diffusion equation conditioned by the measured surface temperature. In NDE applications, we are interested in the reconstruction of the initial temperature profile, since it infers the internal structure of the inspected material. Mathematically, this can be formulated as a large-scale linear inverse problem which is highly ill-posed.     
In this talk, we propose a hybrid approach for thermographic imaging in which we combine numerical regularization with deep learning to improve the reconstruction accuracy. This framework provides new alternatives to extract features with physical interpretation and to incorporate domain knowledge, such as smoothness, non-negativity and sparsity,  automatically during the reconstruction procedure. As a case study, applications in NDE material testing will be considered starting with 2D problems towards thermal tomography in 3D.

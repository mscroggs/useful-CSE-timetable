<h2>Probabilistic Methods for Model-Form Uncertainty</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk167' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(167)' class='star'><span class='star167'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM (D406)</b> Kerry Klemmer, Leveraging Model Assumptions for Model Form Uncertainty Quantification <span id='bitlink-158'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(158)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-158' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(158)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Leveraging Model Assumptions for Model Form Uncertainty Quantification</b><br />Kerry Klemmer<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-37.html'>Probabilistic Methods for Model-Form Uncertainty</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>Model-form uncertainty arises from physical assumptions made in constructing models either to reduce the physical complexity or to model physical processes that are not well understood. In Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling and turbulent combustion modeling, some of these assumptions are known and can be leveraged as a priori knowledge in quantifying the uncertainty. Three such approaches are presented in this talk that take advantage of the physics inherently neglected by a model in order to characterize the structural uncertainties and model-form error. The “peer models” approach compares the model output between two equally plausible models with divergent assumptions, such that model variability is indicative of model error. The “hierarchical models” approach identifies a hierarchy of models of increasing fidelity and functionalizes the error in a lower fidelity model based on the principles of a higher fidelity model. These first two approaches are applied to turbulent reacting flows, where the model-form error is propagated through Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using stochastic collocation. The final “implied models” approach analyzes the model error through the derivation of a transport equation for the model error that is implied by the model for the quantity of interest. The “implied models” approach is applied to RANS turbulence model for multiple turbulent flow configurations in order to better understand the sources of model-form error including the role of error cancellation and error superposition.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75253' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk168' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(168)' class='star'><span class='star168'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (D406)</b> Katharine Fisher, Use of Multiple Functional Approximations to Infer Uncertainty in Density Functional Theory <span id='bitlink-159'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(159)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-159' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(159)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Use of Multiple Functional Approximations to Infer Uncertainty in Density Functional Theory</b><br />Katharine Fisher<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-37.html'>Probabilistic Methods for Model-Form Uncertainty</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>Kohn Sham Density functional theory (KS-DFT) is a first principles electronic structures method widely used in chemistry, physics, and materials science, but predictions rely on an exchange correlation (XC) functional, the form of which is unknown. Many density functional approximations (DFAs) have been developed in attempt to capture the XC functional, but it is difficult to determine which approximation is best suited to a given problem, and the choice of approximation is a major source of predictive uncertainty. This talk will present an approach to infer probability distributions over predicted quantities by leveraging a data set of DFT predictions computed using an ensemble of different DFAs for a range of molecules. To perform inference, we require some model of the relationship between molecules as well as DFAs. We use a multitask Gaussian Process regression framework to relate regression problems corresponding to different DFAs and define kernel functions to relate descriptors of individual molecules. Tests informed by predictions of the ionization potential of small organic molecules indicate that incorporating multiple DFAs through the multitask framework can improve predictive accuracy compared to a single Gaussian Process regression model informed by one DFA. The challenge of producing robust uncertainty predictions from the distributions predicted by GP regression is ongoing work.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75253' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk169' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(169)' class='star'><span class='star169'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (D406)</b> Teresa Portone, Quantifying Model Prediction Sensitivity to Model-Form Uncertainty <span id='bitlink-160'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(160)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-160' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(160)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quantifying Model Prediction Sensitivity to Model-Form Uncertainty</b><br />Teresa Portone<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-37.html'>Probabilistic Methods for Model-Form Uncertainty</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>In the process of model development, limited knowledge and computational resources necessitate simplifying assumptions that are not valid in all cases, leading to model-form uncertainty (MFU). When model predictions must be used to inform high-consequence engineering-design and policy decisions, it is critical to understand how they are impacted by uncertainty in these assumptions. We present a novel method to quantify this impact by combining parameterized modifications to modeling assumptions, representing MFU, with grouped variance-based sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate the approach on a subsurface contaminant transport model, and we present theoretical and numerical results on the robustness of the approach to the mathematical form of the MFU parameterization.

In the last two decades, important progress has been made in the experimental characterization and thermodynamic modeling of pore water speciation, but the influence of experimental artifacts and uncertainties of thermodynamic input parameters are seldom evaluated. In this respect, we conducted an uncertainty propagation study in a reference geochemical model describing the pore water chemistry of the Callovian-Oxfordian clay formation. Nineteen model input parameters were perturbed, including those associated to experimental characterization (leached anions, exchanged cations, cation exchange selectivity coefficients) and those associated to generic thermodynamic databases (solubilities). A set of 13 quantities of interest were studied by the use of polynomial chaos expansions built non-intrusively with a least-squares forward stepwise regression approach. Training and validation sets of simulations were carried out using the geochemical speciation code PHREEQC. The statistical results explored the marginal distribution of each quantity of interest, their bivariate correlations as well as their global sensitivity indices. The influence of the assumed distributions for input parameters uncertainties was evaluated by considering two parametric domain sizes.

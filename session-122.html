We introduce a nonlinear approximation technique called convex displacement interpolation  based on a solution mapping as a function of the parameters, via optimal transportation.  We discuss the advantages and disadvantages in this framework of linear or nonlinear, intrusive or non-intrusive model reduction approaches.

Compared to high-fidelity, full-order models, reduced order models (ROMs) relying, e.g., on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provide reliable approximations to parameter-dependent fluid dynamics problems in rapid times. However, they might require expensive hyper-reduction strategies for handling nonlinear terms, and enriched reduced spaces if a mixed velocity-pressure formulation is considered, possibly hampering the evaluation of reliable solutions in real-time. Dealing with fluid-structure interactions entails even greater difficulties. We propose a new class of deep learning (DL)-based ROMs that overcome all these limitations by learning, in a nonintrusive way, both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics. To do so, they rely on deep neural networks, such as convolutional autoencoders and deep feedforward neural networks, after performing a former dimensionality reduction through POD that enhances training times substantially. Moreover, including long short-term memory (LSTM) cells enables long-term prediction of complex systemsâ€™ evolution, with respect to the training window, for unseen input parameter values. Numerical results show the capability of POD-DL-ROMs to provide accurate results, in real-time, in multiple contexts, ranging from haemodynamics to fluid-structure interaction problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75410' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk559' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(559)' class='star'><span class='star559'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (E103)</b> Imran Shah, Reduced Order Modeling for Real-Time Shape Optimization of the Total Cavopulmonary Connection in Fontan Surgical Planning <span id='bitlink-518'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(518)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-518' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(518)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reduced Order Modeling for Real-Time Shape Optimization of the Total Cavopulmonary Connection in Fontan Surgical Planning</b><br />Imran Shah<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-122.html'>Model Order Reduction Methods for Parameterized Fluid Flows - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>The Fontan operation is a surgery for children born with ventricular defects, where the inferior vena cava (IVC) is routed to the pulmonary arteries (PA) to form the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). This represents a shape optimization problem, where differences in the anatomy result in unique hemodynamics. However, the costs of simulating such cases via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) becomes extremely expensive, especially for testing various TCPC geometries in a trial-and-error fashion. Here, we introduce a reduced order modeling (ROM) framework for real-time shape optimization of the TCPC. In the offline phase of the ROM, the IVC offset with respect to the PAs was parameterized resulting in 100 transient CFD simulations being performed, from which a snapshot library was created. The library was recycled in the online stage for a new set of parameters using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition approach. A shape optimization problem was implemented using the framework, where the optimization criteria was based on the hepatic flow distribution (HFD). ROM solutions were in strong agreement with full order model (FOM) solutions with regards to pressure, velocity, and flow dynamics. The FOM required an average of 153.5 seconds while the ROM reduced this to 27.5 seconds, an 82.1% decrease in computation time. Using this framework, the optimal TCPC geometry for a given HFD value was rapidly calculated, requiring less than 15 minutes for finding the optimal solution.

Introduction of a projection-based reduced order model (ROM) for one or more of the sub-models can significantly decrease the on-line computational cost of the system. In this talk, a heterogeneous sub-model case will be considered, having two non-overlapping subdomains. We present a partitioned method that provides for the coupling of a ROM on one subdomain with either a ROM or a full-order model on the other. At the crux of this method is a dual Schur complement system which implicitly expresses a Lagrange multiplier (LM), representing the interfacial flux, in terms of the state variables. In order to ensure the non-singularity of this system, we develop the ROM by creating separate reduced bases for the interior and interfacial degrees of freedom as well as providing a reduction for the LM space. The solution of the Schur complement system and the application of an explicit time-stepping scheme allow for the two subdomain equations to be decoupled and independently solved at each time step. We show numerical results demonstrating the capability of the method to represent each type of coupling.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75410' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

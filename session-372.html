Numerical simulations are commonly used to understand the mechanism of bell propulsion and the resulting fluid dynamics. These simulations use simplified jellyfish models, typically only simulating the jellyfish bell and neglecting the oral arms. However, a blue blubber jellyfishâ€™s oral arms are prominent; together, the oral arms are close to the diameter of the jelly bell. Neglecting the oral arms would result in overly idealized fluid dynamics, not considering the vortex shedding from the bell interacting with passive elastic structures. This work uses the immersed boundary finite element (IBFE) method to simulate a fully 3D swimming blue blubber jellyfish, including the oral arms. Additionally, swimming is driven using a muscle model rather than with prescribed motion, allowing for emergent behavior. The work is implemented in IBAMR, an adaptive, parallelizable implementation of the immersed boundary method with IBFE capabilities. The methodology and modeling will be discussed in addition to the challenges and need for improved methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75811' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1681' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1681)' class='star'><span class='star1681'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (E105)</b> Robert D.

The effects of fluid elasticity on motility remain poorly understood, partly because, the swimmer strokes depend on the properties of the fluid medium, which obfuscates the mechanisms responsible for observed behavioral changes.  Gait adaptation is essential for biological function, but how organisms adapt their gait and the significance of these changes for biological function are not known. We use computational and mathematical modeling to (1) disentangle these affects by changing the gait and fluid rheology independently and to (2) examine how the swimmer gait emerges from the properties of the environment. We present a series of problems of increasing complexity: prescribed gait, prescribed motor activity, and fully emergent motion. We also discuss methodological advances to the Immersed Boundary method involved in performing these simulations.      </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75811' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1682' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1682)' class='star'><span class='star1682'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (E105)</b> Aaron Barrett, Towards Models of Blood Clotting on Moving Surfaces <span id='bitlink-1542'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1542)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1542' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1542)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards Models of Blood Clotting on Moving Surfaces</b><br />Aaron Barrett<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-372.html'>Immersed Boundary and Related Methods: Advances in Methodology and Biological Applications - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Blood clotting is a complex phenomenon which involves interplay between biochemistry and fluid-structure interactions. For example, subclinical leaflet thrombosis is a potentially serious complication of aortic valve replacement in which clots form on the replacement valve. Clots in the left atrial appendage can dislodge during atrial fibrillation, which leads to an increased risk of strokes. Models of thrombosis in these kinds of systems must take into account the motion of both the structure and thrombus as well as the biochemistry to accurately describe formation of the thrombus. Herein, we describe recent approaches to model the clotting process within the context of fluid-structure interaction. We focus on two key components of thrombus modeling: deposition of material onto surfaces, and the growth of the thrombus into the lumen. While the methods presented are applied to clotting problems, these methods can also be used to model deposition and absorption along other moving boundaries, such as drug absorption in the gut or particulate deposition in the lungs.

In this contribution, we present a new phase-field model for adhesion and discuss its underlying foundations in terms of thermomechanical consistency. The interaction between adhesive interfaces is modelled by the introduction of a coupling term in the classical free energy. The resulting phase-field model is a stiff, higher-order, non-linear partial differential equation, in which adhesive interaction is regularized onto the moving interfaces.    
We characterize the singular limit of the adhesion problem. Under the assumption of the existence of a smooth limiting interface, we identify the limiting sharp-interface energy of our adhesion problem and demonstrate that its minimisers are geometric surfaces with a non-trivial adhered part.    
Lastly, we provide numerical examples of adhesion and show how unconditionally energy-stable results can be obtained by using the scalar auxiliary variable approach as time-discretization scheme. Furthermore, we discuss application of the presented model to problems in cell biology, which is vital in understanding numerous biological processes, including cell migration, structural integrity and signal transduction. We show how the model can be extended to account for the protein dynamics at a cellâ€™s membrane, which govern the binding and unbinding of a cell to its extracellular environment.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75811' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

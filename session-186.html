<h2>Matrix-Free Solvers for Large-Scale Applications</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk850' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(850)' class='star'><span class='star850'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM (E103)</b> Peter Munch, Application and Tailoring of Matrix-Free Algorithms to Many-Particle Solid-State-Sintering Phase-Field Implementations <span id='bitlink-783'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(783)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-783' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(783)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Application and Tailoring of Matrix-Free Algorithms to Many-Particle Solid-State-Sintering Phase-Field Implementations</b><br />Peter Munch<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-186.html'>Matrix-Free Solvers for Large-Scale Applications</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Biodegradable magnesium implants bear a great potential since they degrade after a certain period, during which they temporarily support the healing process. Solid-state-sintering processes are able to produce patient-specific implants. In order to understand and improve the manufacturing process, we perform experiments and develop numerical tools, e.g., based on phase-field (PF) methods, at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon.  To be able to simulate problems at late simulation stages when a spherical approximation of particles is not applicable with many particles (1000), we have reimplemented parts of our PF code, leveraging state-of-the-art matrix-free finite-element building blocks.    
In this presentation, we summarize our efforts in porting a sintering application to matrix-free FEM and discuss challenges we faced in solving such a highly nonlinear and dynamic problem: in particular, 1) the challenge of dealing with a high number of scalar components (up to 15), which dynamically changes, when particles move or merge; and 2) the development of a block preconditioner for the solution of the Jacobian matrix, which we evaluate in a matrix-free fashion.    
Our solver employs deal.II for spacial discretization and adaptive mesh refinement as well as Trilinosâ€™ non-linear and linear solver capabilities. Results will also contain performance analyses conducted on SuperMUC-NG supercomputer.

Despite their excellent convergence properties, they are not widely used, possibly, due to their challenging implementation. Recent comprehensive support for $hp$-FEM in the deal.II library attempts to close this gap, yet reveals new challenges: We observed that common off-the-shelf matrix-based solvers are inadequate for $hp$-FEM applications both from a memory-consumption and a performance point of view. As a compelling alternative solver, we present herein a hybrid multigrid preconditioner that globally coarsens both $p$ and $h$ and can be evaluated in a state-of-the-art matrix-free fashion on parallel distributed systems. We compare its performance and scalability to algebraic multigrid methods, using realistic computations on up to many thousands of MPI processes as test cases.

One key challenge is that the associated matrices are generally too dense to compute and store, necessitating the development of matrix-free preconditioners.    
In this talk, I will describe the construction of a class of low-order-refined preconditioners for problems posed in all spaces of the high-order finite element de Rham complex. This construction is facilitated by the use of an interpolation-histopolation basis that guarantees spectral equivalence of the high-order and low-order-refined operators, independent of the mesh size $h$ and polynomial degree $p$. Specialized algebraic multigrid methods can then be used to obtain scalable, high-performance, GPU-accelerated, matrix-free solvers for the high-order problems.    
Additionally, I will describe the development of new matrix-free solvers for grad-div problems and mixed finite element problems in $\boldsymbol{H}(\operatorname{div})$. These solvers are based on solving the saddle-point system, and also use properties of the interpolation-histopolation basis to achieve enhanced sparsity.

We demonstrate that matrix-free methods based on libCEED are faster for all finite element orders, and that increasing the order of accuracy further reduces the cost per degree of freedom, leading to order of magnitude reduction in simulation cost to reach engineering tolerances. We discuss the design of a matrix-free p-multigrid method and explore solver robustness and efficiency in nonlinear analysis of lattice structures and bonded particulate materials with billions of degrees of freedom, with special attention to recent GPU-based architectures. We also demonstrate how the same principles enable transformative capability in simulation of compressible turbulence.

One of the only available tools for huge matrices is the Monte Carlo algorithm, which also has the advantage of being able to compute matrix-free, i.e., computing matrix elements as needed, which is essential for truly huge problems for which it is not even possible to store a full vector. To facilitate this latter scenario, we compute the projection of the various matrix functions onto the vector we are interested in with the assumption that we can compute the vector elements also on demand. However, it has been shown that this one-element-at-a-time approach cannot guarantee convergence of the statistical error.  On the other hand, our recent algorithm that computes with matrix tiles can guarantee convergence for sufficiently large tiles. We compute matrix functions by summing a polynomial approximation (e.g., Taylor, Chebyshev, etc.).  We first investigate the convergence conditions for each matrix and provide an expression for the statistical error. Then, we optimize the algorithm in terms of operation time and accuracy by adjusting the parameters such as the tile size and the number of samples for given target error. We also apply variance reduction techniques to reduce the statistical error with the same computational cost. Finally, we show numerical examples from quantum chemistry.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75488' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

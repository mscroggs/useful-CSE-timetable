The soft robots consist of tapered, hollow tubes constructed of a polyacrylamide-based hydrogel polymer, with magnets embedded at both ends. The magnets allow actuation via torque applied by a uniform rotating magnetic field. We demonstrate the propulsion of the soft-robots in viscous Newtonian fluids, and connect it to the deformations of the soft robot under magnetic actuation.  Our results suggest that the geometrical asymmetry of tapering enables propulsion, and suggest ways to further refine the design of such soft robots.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75250' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk152' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(152)' class='star'><span class='star152'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (G110)</b> Laurel Ohm, Results on Classical Elastohydrodynamics for a Swimming Filament <span id='bitlink-144'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(144)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-144' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(144)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Results on Classical Elastohydrodynamics for a Swimming Filament</b><br />Laurel Ohm<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-34.html'>Computational Methods and Analysis for Biological Applications in Stokes Flow - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>We consider two models of an immersed inextensible filament undergoing planar motion in $\mathbb{R}^3$: (1) the classical elastohydrodynamic model using resistive force theory coupled with Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, and (2) a novel curve evolution formulation incorporating the effects of linear viscoelasticity.

Runs are the directed movement driven by a flagellar bundle and tumbles are reorientations of cells caused by some motor reversals from CCW to CW. Our simulations reveal that physical properties of the hook and the counterrotation of the cell body are important factors for efficient flagellar bundling, and that longer hooks in mutant cell models create an instability and disrupt the bundling process, resulting in a limited range of movement. Moreover, we demonstrate that cells can explore environment near surface by making variations of tumble events as they swim close to the surface.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75250' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk154' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(154)' class='star'><span class='star154'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM (G110)</b> Hoa Nguyen, Effects of Prey Capture on the Swimming and Feeding Performance of Choanoflagellates <span id='bitlink-146'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(146)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-146' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(146)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Effects of Prey Capture on the Swimming and Feeding Performance of Choanoflagellates</b><br />Hoa Nguyen<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-34.html'>Computational Methods and Analysis for Biological Applications in Stokes Flow - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Locomoting organisms often carry loads such as captured prey or young. Load-carrying effects on high Reynolds number flight have been studied, but the fluid dynamics of load-carrying by low Reynolds number microorganisms have not. We studied low Reynolds number load-carrying using unicellular choanoflagellates, which wave a flagellum to swim and create a water current transporting bacterial prey to a food-capturing collar of microvilli.  A regularized Stokeslet framework was used to model the hydrodynamics of a swimming choanoflagellate with bacterial prey on its collar. Both the model and microvideography of choanoflagellates showed that swimming speed decreases as number of prey being carried increases.  Flux of water into the capture zone is reduced by bacteria on the collar, which redirect the water flow and occlude parts of the collar. Feeding efficiency (prey captured per work to produce the feeding current) is decreased more by large prey, prey in the plane of flagellar beating, and prey near microvillar tips than by prey in other locations.  Some choanoflagellates can attach themselves to surfaces. We found that the reduction in flux due to bacterial prey on the collars of these attached thecate cells was similar to the reduction in flux for swimmers.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75250' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk155' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(155)' class='star'><span class='star155'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM (G110)</b> Yue Hao, Image-Based Flow Simulation of Platelet Aggregates under Variable Shear Flow <span id='bitlink-147'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(147)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-147' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(147)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Image-Based Flow Simulation of Platelet Aggregates under Variable Shear Flow</b><br />Yue Hao<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-34.html'>Computational Methods and Analysis for Biological Applications in Stokes Flow - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>As the initial step of hemostasis and thrombosis, platelet aggregates significantly affect the formation and stability of thrombi. The mechanical properties of such aggregates are influenced by their microstructure and their interaction with the flow during formation. However, due to technical limitations, it is difficult to study the intrathrombus conditions of platelet aggregates only by experimental or computational approaches.  In this work, an image-based computational model is proposed based on two sets of microscopy images of three different platelet aggregates formed under different external flow rates to study the blood flow behavior within such aggregates. These image sets are captured from whole blood perfused microfluidic chambers coated with collagen. One set of images captured the shape of the aggregate outline, while the other employed platelet labeling to infer the internal density. The platelet aggregates are considered as porous mediums. The computational model is subsequently applied to study the blood flow behavior and the interaction between the platelet aggregates and the blood flow under different shear rates. The penetration depth, represented by the boundary of convective and diffusive transport, is also investigated. The results show that external flow velocity has a significant influence on the agonist transport in the outer layers of the aggregate, while the internal core stably remains in the diffusion dominated regime.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75250' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

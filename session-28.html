For scattering kernels of finite Fourier content in the angular variable, we show how to simultaneously recover the scalar and vector field sources from boundary measurements. The approach is based on the Cauchy problem for a Beltrami-like equation associated with A-analytic maps in the sense of Bukhgeim.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop regularization methods that aim to find an approximate but stable solutions. A regularization method consists of a family of stable reconstruction methods that converge, as the noise level tends to zero, to an exact solution of the inverse problem. The standard approach is variational regularization, which minimizes a data discrepancy term augmented by a regularizer. The actual numerical implementation applies iterative methods, often involving proximal maps of the regularizer. In recent years, Plug and Play (PnP) iterations have been developed as a new powerful generalization by replacing proximal mappings in variational regularization with general image denoisers. While PnP iterations achieve excellent results, neither stability nor convergence in the sense of regularization have been investigated so far. In this paper, we extend the idea of PnP by considering families of PnP iterations, each accompanied by its own denoiser.  As main theoretical result, we show that such PnP methods leads to a stable and convergent regularization method for decreasing noise level. This demonstrates that the PnP method is mathematically equally justified as the variational model for convergent and stable image reconstruction.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75242' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk127' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(127)' class='star'><span class='star127'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (E101)</b> Daniel Obmann, Convergence Analysis of Critical Point Regularization with Non-Convex Regularizers <span id='bitlink-120'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(120)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-120' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(120)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Convergence Analysis of Critical Point Regularization with Non-Convex Regularizers</b><br />Daniel Obmann<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-28.html'>New Methods for Solving Inverse Problems in Imaging</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>In recent years, several methods using regularizers defined by neural networks as penalty terms in variational methods have been developed.   One of the key assumptions in the stability and convergence analysis of these methods is the ability of finding global minimizers.  However, such an assumption is often not feasible when the regularizer is a black box or non-convex, making the search for global minimizers of the involved Tikhonov functional a challenging task. Instead, standard minimization schemes are applied which typically only guarantee that a critical point is found. To address this issue, we study stability and convergence properties of critical points of Tikhonov functionals with a possible non-convex regularizer. We show that even in such cases a full convergence analysis can be given and we provide numerical simulations which support our findings.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75242' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk128' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(128)' class='star'><span class='star128'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (E101)</b> Lukas Pieronek, On Regularization in $L^\infty$ <span id='bitlink-121'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(121)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-121' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(121)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On Regularization in $L^\infty$</b><br />Lukas Pieronek<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-28.html'>New Methods for Solving Inverse Problems in Imaging</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>Many inverse problems arise as parameter identification problems for PDE coefficients which are naturally assigend to $L^{\infty}$. However, this space is non-smooth, non-reflexive and non-separable which hinders the application of standard Banach space methods. In this talk we present a novel regularisation method which generates uniformly bounded iterates as approximate solutions to locally ill-posed equations and for which the regularisation property holds with respect to weak-* convergence. Numerical examples from Full Waveform Inversion will complete our analysis.

Such scenarios arise in many imaging applications (e.g., anomaly detection in atmospheric emissions tomography) where the reconstructed solution can be represented as a combination of two or more components and each component contains different smoothness or stochastic properties. In a deterministic inversion or inverse modeling framework, these assumptions correspond to different regularization terms for each solution in the sum. Although various prior assumptions can be included in our framework, we focus on the scenario where the solution is a sum of a sparse solution and a smooth solution. For  computing solution estimates, we develop hybrid projection methods for solution decomposition that are based on a combined flexible and generalized Golub-Kahan processes. This approach integrates  techniques from the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization and the flexible Krylov methods. The benefits of the proposed methods are that the decomposition of the solution can be done iteratively,  and the regularization terms and regularization parameters are adaptively chosen at each iteration. Numerical results from photoacoustic tomography and atmospheric inverse modeling demonstrate the potential for these methods to be used for anomaly detection.

Iterative parallel-in-time (PinT) methods, like Parareal, MGRIT, and PFASST, have received the most attention.  Since those algorithms have different variants and can depend on many parameters, there is many ways for the scientific community to use them for PinT simulations. The optimal approach for one given problem is then quite difficult to determine.    
Parallel efficiency of iterative PinT algorithms relies on two aspects : the number of iterations required to get the PinT error below an acceptable level (convergence) and the computational cost for doing all those iterations, compared to a sequential simulation (speedup).  Recently, a new analysis approach has been introduced to study and compare the convergence analysis of all iterative PinT methods in a common framework. On an other side, recent research work have investigated how to compare the parallel performance of PinT methods using a common approach.  In this talk, we present our recent work in trying to merge both analysis (convergence & speedup), in order to develop a generic tool that can be used to compare the parallel performance of several PinT methods on simple problems, and provide indications on optimal approach for a given type of problem.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75574' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1129' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1129)' class='star'><span class='star1129'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (G109)</b> Wayne Mitchell, Performance of Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) on GPU Machines <span id='bitlink-1043'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1043)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1043' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1043)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Performance of Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) on GPU Machines</b><br />Wayne Mitchell<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-248.html'>Parallel-in-Time Algorithms: Performance and Real-World Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) is an optimal, scalable, multilevel parallel in time algorithm that has been shown to achieve significant speedup vs. sequential time stepping on massively parallel CPU machines. This speedup is attained through the use of additional computational resources and only occurs after a "cross-over point" where sufficient parallel resources are concurrently used. This talk examines how the move to GPU architectures impacts speedup, the crossover point, and the best choice of parallel decomposition of the space-time domain for MGRIT compared to CPU architectures.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75574' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1130' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1130)' class='star'><span class='star1130'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G109)</b> Kamran Pentland, GParareal: (Towards) a Probabilistic Time-Parallel ODE Solver <span id='bitlink-1044'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1044)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1044' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1044)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>GParareal: (Towards) a Probabilistic Time-Parallel ODE Solver</b><br />Kamran Pentland<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-248.html'>Parallel-in-Time Algorithms: Performance and Real-World Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Parareal is a well-studied (deterministic) time-parallel algorithm designed to integrate initial value problems (IVPs) by combining solutions from cheap (coarse) and expensive (fine) numerical integrators using a predictor-corrector (PC). We present GParareal, a Parareal-type algorithm which models the correction term in the PC using a Gaussian process emulator, trained on all previously collected fine and coarse solution information. For a number of test IVPs, we demonstrate that GParareal locates solutions in faster wallclock time than Parareal and can locate solutions in situations where Parareal fails. We highlight that GParareal has the advantageous capability to re-use legacy solution data, e.g. solutions from prior simulations of the IVP for different initial conditions, to further accelerate convergence of the method - something that existing time-parallel methods cannot do.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75574' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1131' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1131)' class='star'><span class='star1131'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G109)</b> Luisa D'Amore, Innovative Space-Time Domain Decomposition Method Solving Uncertainty Quantification Models <span id='bitlink-1045'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1045)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1045' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1045)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Innovative Space-Time Domain Decomposition Method Solving Uncertainty Quantification Models</b><br />Luisa D'Amore<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-248.html'>Parallel-in-Time Algorithms: Performance and Real-World Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>We present an innovative mathematical model and the related numerical algorithms, based on the simultaneous introduction of space-time decomposition on the PDEs governing the physical model and on the DA model. The core of our approach is that the DA model acts as coarse predictor operator solving the local PDE model, by providing the background values as initial conditions of the local PDE models. To enforce the matching of local solutions on overlapping regions, local problems are modified by adding a correction term keeping track of contributions of adjacent subdomains to overlapping regions. Such a correction term balances localization errors along overlapping regions, acting as a regularization constraint on local solutions. Moreover, in our approach both the coarse and the fine solvers run concurrently from the beginning. Consequently, the resulting algorithm requires only the exchange of boundary conditions between adjacent subdomains. Algorithm scalability is measured in terms of strong scaling  and of weak scaling. A mechanism for dynamically balancing the loads has been included in the parallel framework for solving large-scale DA models. In particular, we refer to the introduction of a dynamic redefining of initial DD in order to deal with problems where the observations are non uniformly distributed and general sparse, a quite common issue in DA.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75574' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1132' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1132)' class='star'><span class='star1132'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (G109)</b> Riccardo Tenderini, On the Combination Between Space-Time Model Order Reduction Methods and Deep Learning for Haemodynamic Problems <span id='bitlink-1046'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1046)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1046' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1046)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On the Combination Between Space-Time Model Order Reduction Methods and Deep Learning for Haemodynamic Problems</b><br />Riccardo Tenderini<br />Tuesday, February 28 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-248.html'>Parallel-in-Time Algorithms: Performance and Real-World Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Deep learning (DL) techniques have nowadays become central in a number of research areas. However, a well-known downside of DL-based methods consists in the huge amount of data required, which often hinders their application. Recent works in the scientific machine learning area have demonstrated that the data greed bottleneck can be circumvented by enforcing physical awareness. Indeed, if DL models are enriched with knowledge of the physical laws underlying the phenomenon of interest, they can attain remarkable levels of accuracy even in a small data regime and, moreover, their generalization capabilities can be improved. In this talk, we present a physics-informed model - called ST-RB-DNN - that encodes scattered values of solutions to unsteady parametrized PDEs to the underlying parameter values, leveraging model order reduction techniques. In particular, we employed space-time reduced basis (ST-RB) methods, since they allow for dramatic lightening of the computational burden, by means of dimensionality reduction along both the spatial and the temporal dimensions. For the numerical tests, we consider blood flow - modeled via the Navier-Stokes equations - in different patient-specific 3D geometries. In all cases, the ST-RB-DNN model provides good estimates of the underlying parameter values. Further extensions of this work involve the implementation of RFSI models to account for the vessel wall compliance and of ad hoc boundary conditions to better model coronary flow.

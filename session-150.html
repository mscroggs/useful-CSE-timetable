The main applications are in pattern formation   for classical semilinear PDEs, e.g., reaction diffusion systems.   Here we explain the numerical challenges for geometric   PDEs such as constant mean curvature surfaces, for instance   liquid bridges and triply periodic surfaces, and some higher order   problems such as shape equations for vesicles, and present some   recent solutions, and bifurcation results for such problems   obtained with {\tt pde2path}.      </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75445' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk682' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(682)' class='star'><span class='star682'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (D304)</b> Lennaert van Veen, Pattern Formation in a Nonlocal Model for Microbial Motility <span id='bitlink-634'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(634)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-634' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(634)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Pattern Formation in a Nonlocal Model for Microbial Motility</b><br />Lennaert van Veen<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-150.html'>Algorithms for Bifurcation Analysis of Partial Differential Equations</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>We study a model of aggregation of organisms in two spatial dimensions. The uninhibited motion of the organisms is represented by a transport equation for the organism density, while the sensing of the environment, for instance by auditory clues or chemotaxis, is represented by spatial convolutions. The sensing mechanism includes a cut-off at low signal intensity and a saturation at high intensity. We investigate the patterns that arise at critical values of the parameters that regulate the sensing, as well as their spectra and the secondary bifurcations they produce.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75445' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk683' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(683)' class='star'><span class='star683'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (D304)</b> Andrew Hazel, Adaptive Continuation Methods for Nonlinear PDEs in Deforming Domains <span id='bitlink-635'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(635)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-635' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(635)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Continuation Methods for Nonlinear PDEs in Deforming Domains</b><br />Andrew Hazel<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-150.html'>Algorithms for Bifurcation Analysis of Partial Differential Equations</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>Many problems in mechanics require the solution of partial differential equations within deforming domains; for example, fluid flows containing drops and bubbles, or flows within elastic tubes and channels. The deformation of the domain typically leads to nonlinearities within the system, even when the bulk equations are linear, which can give rise to complex bifurcation structures that connect multiple solution branches.    
Another aspect of such systems is that fine-scale features of the solutions are often localised in space and time, meaning that mesh adaptivity is advantageous for efficient numerical solution. Traditional continuation methods designed to follow solution branches are generally formulated from discrete, rather than continuous, systems, which presents problems if the discretisation is not fixed over the parameter range of interest.    
In this talk, I will explain the generic implementation of spatially adaptive continuation methods within the software library oomph-lib (https://www.oomph-lib.org) and how these methods can be used to explore the complex solution structures that arise when solving nonlinear PDEs in deforming domains.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75445' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk684' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(684)' class='star'><span class='star684'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (D304)</b> Juan Sanchez Umbr&#237;a, Torsional Flows of Convection in Rotating Fluid Spheres: Computation of the Critical Region, the Periodic Solutions, and Their Stability <span id='bitlink-636'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(636)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-636' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(636)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Torsional Flows of Convection in Rotating Fluid Spheres: Computation of the Critical Region, the Periodic Solutions, and Their Stability</b><br />Juan Sanchez Umbr&#237;a<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-150.html'>Algorithms for Bifurcation Analysis of Partial Differential Equations</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>It is known that the onset of convection in rotating fluid spheres and  spherical shells usually gives rise to rotating waves, which can travel in the prograde or retrograde direction relative to the frame of reference  rotating with the bulk of the fluid. It was discovered recently that  axisymmetric periodic regimes can also be preferred at low Prandtl, Pr, and Ekman, Ek, numbers. These flows are known as torsional.    
In order to determine the parameter-space region where the  axisymmetric flows are the first bifurcated solutions from the  conduction state, the curves of double Hopf points corresponding to  simultaneous transitions to azimuthal wave numbers $(m_1,m_2)=(0,1)$,  (1,1), (0,2), etc. were computed. These curves form the skeleton of  the bifurcation diagram, separating the regions of different preferred  azimuthal wave numbers. Their intersections are triple Hopf points,  several of which were found. It turned out that the region of interest  was limited by the curves $(m_1,m_2)=(0,1)$ and (0,2).    
The torsional solutions emerging form the conduction state were  computed for several pairs (Pr,Ek) inside the above mentioned region,  and their stability to azimuthal dependence was studied using Floquet  multipliers.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75445' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk685' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(685)' class='star'><span class='star685'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM (D304)</b> Mamoon Ahmed, The C*-Dynamical System of Amenable Quasi-Lattice Ordered Groups and Positive Elements <span id='bitlink-637'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(637)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-637' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(637)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The C*-Dynamical System of Amenable Quasi-Lattice Ordered Groups and Positive Elements</b><br />Mamoon Ahmed<br />Monday, February 27 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-150.html'>Algorithms for Bifurcation Analysis of Partial Differential Equations</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>Let $(G,P)$ be a quasi-lattice ordered group. In previous work, the author constructed a universal covariant representation $(A,U)$ for $(G,P)$ in a way that avoids some of the intricacies of the other approaches. Then showed if $(G,P)$ is amenable, true representations of $(G,P)$ generate $C^{*}$-algebras which are canonically isomorphic to the $C^{*}$-algebra generated by the universal covariant representation.    
In this paper, we show that amenability of $(G,P)$ can be established by showing that the universal covariant representation of the $C^{*}$-dynamical system is faithful on the positive elements of the algebra $B_{V}$.

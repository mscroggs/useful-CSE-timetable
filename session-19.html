In fluid flow problems, this problem is usually known as the “closure problem”, and the art is to discover a “closure model” that represents the effect of the small scales on the large scales. Well-known examples appear in large eddy simulations (LES) and in reduced-order models (ROMs). Recently, it appeared that highly accurate closure models can be constructed by using neural networks. However, integrating the neural network into the physics models (“neural closure models”) is typically prone to numerical instabilities as the training environment does not match the prediction environment. Instead, we investigate learning closure models while they are embedded in a discretized PDE solver by using differentiable programming software. This "trajectory fitting" or "embedded learning" approach is a more difficult learning problem than the more classical approach of operator fitting, but promises better accuracy and stability. We compare two strategies to solve the trajectory fitting problem: discretise-then-optimise and optimise-then-discretise. Furthermore, we present a new neural closure model form which allows us to preserve structure, namely kinetic energy conservation, and therefore non-linear stability bounds.

Snapshot-based reduced-order modeling is one of the common remedies to the problem. However, the anatomical geometries used for simulations are either segmented from clinical image data or generated indirectly by computational models, which are typically unparameterized and lead to distinct spatial discretisations.     
In this work, a data-driven surrogate model based on non-intrusive reduced-order modelling with surface registration is proposed. The surrogate model approximates the fluid dynamics of blood flow within vessels of distinct but similar shapes. Different from existing approaches, the proposed surrogate model performs a surface registration to approximate the shape of the target domain from the reference shape. The diffeomorphism constructed during surface registration provides the mapping between the reference domain and the target domain, as well as the parametrisation of the shape. The simulations are subsequently performed on the reference domain to ensure the spatial compatibility of the snapshots. Proper orthogonal decomposition is applied to construct reduced bases and the projection coefficients are computed via a radial basis function interpolation method. Two numerical examples based on stenosis and bifurcation vessels are presented and discussed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the surrogate model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75223' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk88' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(88)' class='star'><span class='star88'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (Forum Centre)</b> Nicola Rares Franco, Model Reduction and Uncertainty Quantification Using Deep Orthogonal Decomposition <span id='bitlink-84'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(84)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-84' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(84)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Model Reduction and Uncertainty Quantification Using Deep Orthogonal Decomposition</b><br />Nicola Rares Franco<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-19.html'>Data-Driven Predictive Modeling in Computational Science - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>In the context of parametrized PDEs, Reduced Order Models (ROMs) allow for an efficient approximation of the parameter-to-solution map, thus enabling expensive many-query routines such as those typical of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Motivated by the limitations of classical approaches such as the Reduced Basis method, many authors have now been considering the use of Deep Learning techniques for building nonintrusive ROMs. Here, we propose a novel approach, Deep Orthogonal Decomposition (DOD), where a deep neural network yields a representation of the solution manifold in terms of an adaptive local basis. In principle, designing and training these models can be a challenging task because of the high dimensions involved. As a remedy, we exploit Mesh-Informed Neural Networks (MINNs), a novel class of architectures designed to handle mesh-based data. MINNs embed hidden layers into discrete functional spaces of increasing complexity, obtained through a sequence of meshes defined over the underlying PDE domain. This results in sparse models that are computationally less demanding and thus better suited for the DOD. We assess the proposed approach over a broad set of numerical experiments, including complicated domains and high dimensional parameter spaces, and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods, such as principal orthogonal decomposition and autoencoders. Finally, we present some applications to (inverse) UQ, showcasing the advantages entailed by the DOD approach.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75223' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk89' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(89)' class='star'><span class='star89'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM (Forum Centre)</b> Sen Lin, Anomaly Detection for Dynamical Systems Using Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection <span id='bitlink-85'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(85)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-85' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(85)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Anomaly Detection for Dynamical Systems Using Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection</b><br />Sen Lin<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-19.html'>Data-Driven Predictive Modeling in Computational Science - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>Data-driven analyses of complex fluid flows are frequently limited by the lack of labeled data. In applications that relate to anomaly or regime transition detection, such a scenario precludes the use of supervised learning techniques. In this study, we deploy unsupervised data-driven transition detection for Kolmogorov flow, as a prototype for real-world applications, where anomaly or regime change detection is desirable without historical data. In particular, we propose the use of a deep variational autoencoder, which encodes high dimensional turbulent flow into disentangled low dimensional representations. Benefiting from extremely weak correlation between latent dimensions, we implement latent Bayesian online changepoint detection algorithm to identify regime transition. We deploy this state-of-art two-stage data-driven approach on the Kolmogorov flow dataset, revealing an accurate correlation between the detected changepoint and a regime transition.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75223' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk90' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(90)' class='star'><span class='star90'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM (Forum Centre)</b> Syver D&#248;ving Agdestein, Stable Discrete Closure Models Through Embedded Learning <span id='bitlink-86'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(86)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-86' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(86)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stable Discrete Closure Models Through Embedded Learning</b><br />Syver D&#248;ving Agdestein<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-19.html'>Data-Driven Predictive Modeling in Computational Science - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>For turbulent fluid flows, neural network closure models can learn to predict sub-grid scale stresses to high accuracy, while still producing instabilities once included in a solver [M. Kurz and A. Beck, Investigating model-data inconsistency in data-informed turbulence closure terms, 14th WCCM-ECCOMAS Congress, CIMNE, 2021]. By minimizing the a-posteriori error of the same models (embedded learning), stability can be enforced [Y. Guan et al., Stable a posteriori LES of 2D turbulence using convolutional neural networks, Journal of Computational Physics, 458:111090, 2022]. This requires a careful choice of hyper-parameters however, e.g. number of time steps unrolled [B. List et al., Learned turbulence modelling with differentiable fluid solvers, arxiv:2202.06988, 2022] and choice of initial parameters [S. D. Agdestein and B. Sanderse, Learning filtered discretization operators, arxiv:2208.09363, 2022]. Care must be taken to avoid local minima and exploding gradients.    
We investigate the accuracy and stability of closure models learned for PDEs subject to explicit discrete filters using embedded learning. The discrete setting allows for computing exact commutator errors and loss functions. We show that the learned closure models produce stable and accurate trajectories for the solution and energy in time upon extrapolation. We also compare the stability of the models trained while embedded in a solver to the one of those trained to predict the discrete commutator error only.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75223' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

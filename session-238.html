<h2>From Math to Code: Domain-Specific Programming Abstractions, Languages, and Frameworks - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1082' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1082)' class='star'><span class='star1082'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (G104)</b> Felix Herrmann, The Next Step: Interoperable Domain-Specific Programming <span id='bitlink-998'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(998)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-998' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(998)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Next Step: Interoperable Domain-Specific Programming</b><br />Felix Herrmann<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-238.html'>From Math to Code: Domain-Specific Programming Abstractions, Languages, and Frameworks - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Even though domain-specific programming approaches allow for readable, scalable, and maintainable software without sacrificing performance, the new paradigm of learned physics-informed models calls for an interdisciplinary approach typically involving multiple domain-specific languages. Take for example the problem of inverting for the fluid-flow properties from time-lapse seismic data, which entails domain-specific programming on the intersection of wave simulators, matrix-free linear algebra, learned neural surrogates for two-phase flow, and prior and posterior distributions for the fluid-flow properties. While domain-specific solutions exist for each of these sub-disciplines, integrating these approaches – which may involve different programming languages – into a single coupled scalable inversion framework that supports algorithmic differentiation can be a challenge. However, we show that challenges like this can be met when working with proper abstractions. In our inversion example, this involves math-inspired symbolic abstractions for numerical solutions of the wave equation (Devito), matrix-free implementations for its Jacobians (JUDI.jl), abstractions for Automatic Differentiation (ChainRules.jl), and homegrown implementations for conditional Invertible Neural Networks (InvertibleNetworks.jl) and Fourier Neural Operators (ParametricOperators.jl).

Such PDEs naturally arise in a wide range of fields including geology, bio-medicine, and fracture mechanics. Mixed-dimensional models are also used to impose non-standard conditions through Lagrange multipliers. Finite element discretizations of such PDEs involve nested meshes of possibly heterogeneous topological dimension. The assembly of such systems is non-standard and non-trivial, and requires the design of both generic high level software abstractions and lower level algorithms.  The FEniCS project aims at automating the numerical solution of PDE-based models using finite element methods. A core feature is a high-level domain-specific language for finite element spaces and variational forms, close to mathematical syntax. Lately, FEniCS gave way to its successor FEniCSx, including major improvements over the legacy library. An automated framework was developed in core FEniCS legacy libraries to address the challenges characterizing mixed-dimensional problems. These concepts were recently ported to FEniCSx, taking advantage of the underlying upgrades in the library features and design. This talk gives an overview of the abstractions and algorithms involved, and their implementation in the FEniCS project core libraries. The introduced features are illustrated by concrete applications in engineering and biomedicine.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75563' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1084' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1084)' class='star'><span class='star1084'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G104)</b> Mathieu Fehr, xDSL: A Compiler Infrastructure for Python DSLs <span id='bitlink-1000'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1000)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1000' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1000)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>xDSL: A Compiler Infrastructure for Python DSLs</b><br />Mathieu Fehr<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-238.html'>From Math to Code: Domain-Specific Programming Abstractions, Languages, and Frameworks - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Domain scientists simulate increasingly larger and more complex phenomena, and as a result, must reason about complex low-level parallelism to harness the full power of heterogeneous architecture. Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) abstract away lower-level decisions for multiple back-ends and architectures, allowing domain experts to reason only about high-level concepts. However, DSLs are often developed in isolation and require a lot of effort on the part of the DSL developer, because they cannot reuse pre-existing abstractions defined by other compilation pipelines. We present xDSL, an extensible Python compiler framework that allows compiler developers to reuse abstractions of existing DSLs. xDSL can also leverage the compiler back-end provided by MLIR, which is a new compiler framework from the LLVM community. Additionally, we will present our first integration of xDSL in the Devito and Psyclone compilers, to demonstrate the capabilities of xDSL towards representing different abstractions. The goal of this project is to help different communities share compiler abstractions, in order to build a rich ecosystem of shared intermediate representations and optimizations instead of a large set of isolated monolithic compilers.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75563' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1085' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1085)' class='star'><span class='star1085'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G104)</b> Nacime Bouziani, Escaping the Abstraction: a Foreign Function Interface for the Unified Form Language (ufl) <span id='bitlink-1001'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1001)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1001' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1001)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Escaping the Abstraction: a Foreign Function Interface for the Unified Form Language (ufl)</b><br />Nacime Bouziani<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-238.html'>From Math to Code: Domain-Specific Programming Abstractions, Languages, and Frameworks - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>High level domain specific languages for the finite element method underpin high productivity programming environments for simulations based on partial differential equations (PDE) while employing automatic code generation to achieve high performance. However, a limitation of this approach is that it does not support operators that are not directly expressible in the vector calculus. This is critical in applications where PDEs are not enough to accurately describe the physical problem of interest.    
Examples include nonlinear implicit constitutive laws such as the Glen's flow law for glacier flow, the use of deep learning models to include features not represented in the differential equations, or closures for unresolved spatiotemporal scales. We introduce an interface within the Firedrake finite element system that enables the inclusion of arbitrary operators in PDE-based problems. This new feature composes with the automatic differentiation capabilities of Firedrake, enabling the automated solution of inverse problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75563' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1086' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1086)' class='star'><span class='star1086'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (G104)</b> Brian Van Straalen, ProtoX: A First Look <span id='bitlink-1002'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1002)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1002' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1002)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>ProtoX: A First Look</b><br />Brian Van Straalen<br />Wednesday, March 1 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-238.html'>From Math to Code: Domain-Specific Programming Abstractions, Languages, and Frameworks - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Stencil operation is a key component in the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Developers tend to use different libraries that provide these operations for them. One such library is Proto. It is a C++ based domain specific library designed to provide an intuitive interface that optimizes the designing and scheduling of an algorithm aimed at solving various partial differential equations numerically. The high level of abstractions used in Proto can be fused together to improve its current performance. However, abstraction fusion cannot be performed easily by a compiler.  In order to overcome this shortcoming we present ProtoX, a code generation framework for stencil operation based on Proto and uses SPIRAL as its backend. SPIRAL is a GAP based code generation system that focuses on generating highly optimized target code in C/C++. We demonstrate the construction of ProtoX by considering two examples, the 2D Poisson problem and the Euler equations that appear in the study of gas dynamics. Some of the code generated for these two problem specifications is shown along with the initial speedup result.

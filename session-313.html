By separating concerns for geometry generation, finite volume stencil generation and solvers, we are able to apply multiple optimizations independently. For example, mesh refinement and subdivision algorithms can be used to achieve very fast, high precision representations of moderately complex surfaces. EB and “tensor” stencils can be represented as mixed-precision “hyper-sparse” matrix operations on block-structured grid data, greatly reducing memory storage and bandwidth. And many nested loop structures and solver operations can be recast as optimized matrix operations that better utilize GPU floating point capabilities. When combined with fast algorithms and calls to optimized GPU libraries, we are able to demonstrate significant speedups over traditional CPU implementations and solvers for real applications.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75701' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1420' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1420)' class='star'><span class='star1420'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (D404)</b> James Gabbard, High-Order Method-of-Lines Time Integration for Sharp Immersed Methods with Moving Boundaries <span id='bitlink-1305'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1305)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1305' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1305)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High-Order Method-of-Lines Time Integration for Sharp Immersed Methods with Moving Boundaries</b><br />James Gabbard<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-313.html'>Recent Advances in Cut Cell Discretizations: Accuracy, Stability, and Applications - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Sharp immersed methods are designed to accurately capture moving boundaries without the computational cost and algorithmic challenges of mesh motion or remeshing. However, these methods face a unique challenge in "fresh" or "emerging" computational elements that change sides of an interface during a given time step. Most existing solutions reconstruct an extended flow field in the vicinity of the interface at each time step with up to second-order accuracy. Here we demonstrate that this methodology can be successfully combined with higher-order spatial discretizations and explicit Runge-Kutta time integrators in a method-of-lines approach, and describe the nature of the associated temporal errors. We show an application of this approach to a high-order 3D immersed interface discretization of the advection diffusion equation with moving interfaces, an important intermediate step on the path to a fully high-order sharp interface Navier-Stokes solver.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75701' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1421' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1421)' class='star'><span class='star1421'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (D404)</b> Nate Overton-Katz, Higher-Order Finite-Volume Embedded Boundary Methods on Moving Domains <span id='bitlink-1306'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1306)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1306' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1306)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Higher-Order Finite-Volume Embedded Boundary Methods on Moving Domains</b><br />Nate Overton-Katz<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-313.html'>Recent Advances in Cut Cell Discretizations: Accuracy, Stability, and Applications - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>This works presents a high-order finite-volume embedded boundary method capable of representing moving boundaries. The algorithm automates mesh generation around complex geometries by embedding them in a Cartesian grid with cut-cells on the boundaries, and is capable of providing high-order geometric information as necessary. In space, the scheme achieves fourth-order accurate discretizations that are stable in the presence of small cut-cells. We devise weighted least-squares reconstructions to achieve this without approaches such as mesh modification, cell merging, or redistribution. In time, we employ a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme which treats viscous and diffusive terms implicitly, while treating the advection and boundary motion terms explicitly.    
We apply this algorithm to modeling the formation of small bubbles of liquid water produced on catalyst sites inside hydrogen fuel-cells. Modeling this system requires coupled multi-phase physics with reactant gasses governed by advection-diffusion equations, produced liquid water governed by the unsteady Stokes equations, and chemical reactions occurring on solid boundaries. Embedded boundaries that evolve in time and depend on the fluid behavior represent the boundaries between the gas, liquid, and solid materials. We demonstrate the formal accuracy of the algorithm using grid refinement studies, and show simulations of practical application.

The equation is solved on a Cartesian axis-aligned grid of 4-node square elements in two dimensions and 8-node cube elements. These intersect the boundary of the domain in a smooth but arbitrary manner. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed strongly by means of a projection method, while Neumann boundary conditions require integration over a locally discretized boundary region. Representative numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is stable and attains the asymptotic convergence rates expected of the corresponding unstructured body-fitted finite element method. Limited proofs of stability (in the sense of the inf-sup condition) are also available and will be discussed.

The stability condition of this method depends only on the largest wave-speed, independent of the order. However, the treatment of general boundary and interface conditions is still a challenge since the Hermite-Taylor method requires not only to know the electromagnetic fields on the boundary and the interface but also their derivatives through order $m$ in each Cartesian coordinate to achieve a ($2\,m+1$)-order accurate method. In this talk, we investigate the correction function method to estimate all the needed information at the nodes near either the boundary or the interface in the Hermite-Taylor setting. The correction function method relies on the minimization of a functional based on Maxwell's equations. This minimization problem has to be solved only for some nodes in the vicinity of the boundary or the interface at each time step. Numerical examples in 1-D and 2-D are performed and the expected convergence order is observed for reasonable values of $m$.

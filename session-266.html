We propose a new approach based on a two-fluid model (TFM). The TFM can be conveniently implemented in an OpenFOAM® solver to allow industrial-scale simulations, including in curvilinear coordinates. Good agreement is found between TFM simulations and previous experiments on shear-induced particle migration. Heat transfer in dense suspension remains a frontier topic. We propose a closure relation for the inter-phase heat transfer coefficient in the TFM, based on calibration against experimental data. This closure allows us to use the OpenFOAM® solver developed to simulate non-isothermal dense suspension flow in an annular Couette cell. In this context, we identify a novel &#8220;thermo-rheological' migration force, which can oppose (or aid) the well-known shear-induced migration.

Such sub-grid closures must account for the effects of the inhomogeneous particle distribution. Several closure models are available in the literature for free flowing and non-cohesive gas-solid flows. In our present study we expand this existing knowledge by investigate the effect of cohesion on the drag force closure, and by proposing a drag closure concept based on machine learning (ML). The key novelty is that our concept allows the rapid generation of closures, making it possible to create a set of closure laws rather than a single closure that might have limitations.     
First, the results of classical unresolved (but unfiltered) CFD-DEM simulations of cohesive gas-particle flow in a pseudo 2D periodic domain are filtered with different filter sizes. Second, corresponding fully 3D simulations were performed, and filtered in an identical manner. Third, closure models were developed from data of 2D and 3D simulations and compared to each other. ML-closures were derived separately with data from the gravitational and non-gravitational (i.e., horizontal) direction, allowing us to demonstrate that filtered drag anisotropy is significant. Our benchmarking of 2D versus 3D closures suggests that only 3D data should be used for closure development in the case of cohesive powders.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75606' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1212' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1212)' class='star'><span class='star1212'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM (D408)</b> Ishan Srivastava, Upscaling Particulate Simulations Towards Continuum Modeling of Dense Granular Flows <span id='bitlink-1123'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1123)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1123' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1123)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Upscaling Particulate Simulations Towards Continuum Modeling of Dense Granular Flows</b><br />Ishan Srivastava<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-266.html'>Computational and Theoretical Advances for Multiphase Flows</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>At high solid volume fractions, the dynamics of dense granular materials are dominated by enduring inter-particle contacts that emerge as intriguing macroscale phenomena such as yield stress, normal stress effects, and geometry-dependent rheology. Particle-based simulations such as the Discrete Element Method (DEM) are well-suited to resolve particulate features, but ill-suited for modeling at continuum scales. Whereas continuum modeling is ideally suited for macroscale simulations, there is a lack of a general constitutive model that correctly accounts for loading geometry and higher-order rate effects. This talk will describe our computational efforts in upscaling DEM simulations towards continuum modeling by developing tensorial rheological models of dense granular flows. DEM-based numerical methods that can simulate granular flows to infinitely large strains for arbitrary imposed loading geometries will be described. These simulations were used to calibrate a frame-indifferent, tensorial, viscoplastic rheological model that is valid for various deformation geometries beyond shear, such as biaxial and triaxial deformations. This talk will describe our ongoing work on implementing a regularized version of the tensorial rheological model in an incompressible flow solver towards simulating dense granular materials at the continuum.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75606' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1213' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1213)' class='star'><span class='star1213'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM (D408)</b> Tomislav Maric, An Unstructured Collocated Finite-Volume Level Set Method for Incompressible Two-Phase Flows with a Geometrical Phase Indicator <span id='bitlink-1124'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1124)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1124' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1124)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Unstructured Collocated Finite-Volume Level Set Method for Incompressible Two-Phase Flows with a Geometrical Phase Indicator</b><br />Tomislav Maric<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-266.html'>Computational and Theoretical Advances for Multiphase Flows</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>The Level Set method for simulating multiphase flows traditionally relies on re-distancing the level-set function. The signed distance is advantageous for the phase indicator computation that relies on algebraic Heaviside function models. Traditionally, the signed-distance property was also motivated by simplified curvature computation and for stabilizing the numerical differentiation. We propose to use a geometrical computation of the zero level-set for the phase indication and the curvature approximation. This approach was disregarded initially for the level set method because of computational costs; however, recent advances in the geometrical computation of volume fractions for the unstructured Volume-of-Fluid method provide high-speed intersection algorithms for non-convex polyhedrons. Our approach omits re-distancing (that amplifies mass loss) while relying on compact-stencil unstructured Finite-Volume discretization of the Level Set equation. The method is sufficiently volume-conservative and accurately advects the phase indicator, while its straightforward equation discretization and efficient geometrical phase indicator deliver a high degree of (parallel) computational efficiency.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75606' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1214' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1214)' class='star'><span class='star1214'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM (D408)</b> Aaron M.

When employing a 'soft-sphere' methodology, where particle collisions are multi-bodied and enduring, a neighbor list must be constructed. Traditionally, the neighbor list is built with a grid that is ~2-3X the largest particle diameter. When considering polydisperse solids, the construction of the neighbor list and computation of collision forces becomes computationally prohibitive since many small particles are contained within a cell. Following [Shire et al., 2021, DOI: 10.1007/s40571-020-00361-2], we implement a multi-grid neighbor search algorithm within AMReX; an exascale-compatible, open-source software for block-structured adaptive mesh refinement [Zhang et al., 2021, DOI: 10.1177/10943420211022811]. Scaling of the multi-grid neighbor search algorithm on CPU and GPU is examined for a variety of gas-solids flows with MFIX-Exa; an open-source Euler-Lagrange solver that is built upon the AMReX library [Musser et al., 2022, DOI: 10.1177/109434202110092].    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75606' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

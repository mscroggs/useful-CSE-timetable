It features Arm-based A64FX CPU, TOFU-D high-performance network interconnect, etc.  to   It has been made available for shared use since March, 2021, and many achievements have already been made with Fugaku in various fields. In this talk, I will show you some efforts to make the supercomputer more usable and productive in the viewpoint of the software environment. First, we have been working to support important open-source software (OSS) packages including libraries, tools, and applications, some of which are optimized for Fugaku. These OSS packages are provided via Spack.  Second, we are working to port and support commercial software on Fugaku in cooperation with Fujitsu and software vendors. Gaussian is the first example and available since Nov. 2022. Finally, we contribute to develop the Arm software ecosystem for HPC. For example, we started  a work of improving the LLVM compiler by implementing more effective optimization feature for A64FX. With these efforts,  users are and will be able to use Fugaku to achieve better productivity and performance.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75714' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1443' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1443)' class='star'><span class='star1443'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (E106)</b> Michael Bareford, Community Software Usage on the UK National Supercomputing Service, ARCHER2 from Analysis of Slurm Data <span id='bitlink-1327'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1327)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1327' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1327)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Community Software Usage on the UK National Supercomputing Service, ARCHER2 from Analysis of Slurm Data</b><br />Michael Bareford<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-318.html'>Computational Science at Extreme Scales</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>In this presentation we analyse the use of software by different research communities on the UK national supercomputing service, ARCHER2. We use data from the Slurm scheduler along with a tool that matches usage to software packages that has been developed over the past two UK national supercomputing services. We see clear differences between how different research communities approach developing, supporting and using software on large scale facilities from the analysis – for example, some communities have a small number of general-purpose software packages used by many researchers, other communities have a much broader range of software packages used by smaller numbers of researchers. We provide some initial thoughts as to why these differences exist and their potential implications from a researcher and service productivity perspective. The analysis tool has recently been extended to provide insight into differences in energy use by different communities and software packages and we present initial findings from this data and how it can potentially support the transition of large-scale HPC facilities to net zero emissions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75714' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1444' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1444)' class='star'><span class='star1444'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (E106)</b> Ryan Richard, Nwchemex: Challenges Faced in Designing An Electronic Structure Program for the Exascale <span id='bitlink-1328'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1328)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1328' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1328)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Nwchemex: Challenges Faced in Designing An Electronic Structure Program for the Exascale</b><br />Ryan Richard<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-318.html'>Computational Science at Extreme Scales</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>For over 20 years,the original NWChem package has been synonymous with massively parallel computational chemistry. Unfortunately the exascale-era version of the high-performance computing (HPC) landscape is dramatically different from the HPC landscape which was present when NWChem was originally designed. Of specific note: HPC hardware is increasingly heterogeneous, C/C++ has replaced Fortran as the dominant HPC language, and object-oriented programming is now the prevailing design paradigm. Ultimately, in order to adopt NWChem to the exascale era, the decision was made to write an entirely new program from scratch.The result is NWChemEx.    
NWChemEx is written in modern object-oriented C++ (presently C++ 17, with the intent to adopt newer C++ standards as compiler support allows). All user-facing C++ application programming interfaces (APIs) are mirrored in Python 3. From a software architecture standpoint, NWChemEx takes separation of concerns to an extreme. The entire package is written as a series of plugins, where each plugin consists of self contained code modules. To the extent possible, the entire code is written using a single instruction, multiple data design paradigm, in turn allowing parallelism to be treated separately from the implementation of new functionality.    
This talk will explain the architecture and design of NWChemEx in more detail including the rationale underpinning our decisions and the challenges faced in implementing NWChemEx.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75714' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1445' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1445)' class='star'><span class='star1445'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (E106)</b> Jared O'Neal, Adapting Experimental Science Tools and Techniques to Computational Sciences <span id='bitlink-1329'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1329)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1329' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1329)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adapting Experimental Science Tools and Techniques to Computational Sciences</b><br />Jared O'Neal<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-318.html'>Computational Science at Extreme Scales</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>As computational mathematics, science, and engineering problems become larger, more ambitious, and more complex, it is increasingly important to develop and use tools and techniques that ensure that computational science research is based on a strong foundation of general, low-level scientific best practices.  In this talk, I will relate my experience of transitioning from working in the worlds of experimental and observational sciences to the world of computational sciences as well as my experience adapting experimental tools and techniques to computational research.  In particular, I will discuss the role of lab notebooks in experimental sciences as well as the challenges associated with adapting lab notebooks to computational sciences research.  Rather than develop this adaptation in isolation, lab notebooks will be addressed within the larger scope of “computational laboratory environments” designed and implemented for executing reproducible computational science studies with solid scientific rigor.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75714' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1446' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1446)' class='star'><span class='star1446'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (E106)</b> Eric Nielsen, Simulations of Human-Scale Mars Lander Descent Trajectories <span id='bitlink-1330'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1330)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1330' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1330)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Simulations of Human-Scale Mars Lander Descent Trajectories</b><br />Eric Nielsen<br />Monday, February 27 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-318.html'>Computational Science at Extreme Scales</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>To achieve human exploration on Mars, new approaches to entry, descent, and landing are necessary in order to support delivery of substantially larger payloads to the surface.  In this presentation, large-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a human-scale Mars lander configuration descending through the Martian atmosphere with the use of retropropulsion are described.  The CFD solver is coupled with a trajectory analysis package which is used to provide the necessary control inputs to maintain the desired flight path.  Simulations are performed using thousands of GPUs on the Summit system located at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing facility.  An overview of the GPU-based implementation is presented, and aerodynamic performance and characteristics of the highly dynamic flowfield are compared with those observed at static freestream conditions as studied in prior computational campaigns.

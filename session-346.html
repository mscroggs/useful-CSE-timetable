MPI provides several abstractions to applications for describing how to move data across processes, such as the use of MPI Datatypes, MPI Neighborhood collectives, or both. However, the solution an application chooses for CPU based communication may experience different performance results when performing the same communication on GPUs. Furthermore, GPUs also introduce additional complexities by forcing the user to decide whether the CPU or the GPU is in charge of sending the data. This talk will look into some of the performance results modern applications and benchmarks are experiencing.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75758' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1571' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1571)' class='star'><span class='star1571'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (E103)</b> Arnoud Delissen, A Multi-GPU Accelerated Linear Solver for Large-Scale Topology Optimization <span id='bitlink-1442'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1442)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1442' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1442)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Multi-GPU Accelerated Linear Solver for Large-Scale Topology Optimization</b><br />Arnoud Delissen<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-346.html'>Recent Developments on GPU-Based Solvers in High-Performance Computing - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Topology optimization is an increasingly popular tool for engineers to obtain lightweight yet stiff designs in an automated way. However, the design resolution is directly linked to the computational time required for the optimization. This is especially true for large-scale applications where a small design resolution is required. For instance, optimizing the structure of TU Delft's Flying V airplane (65 meter wingspan) [F Faggiano, et al., Aerodynamic design of a flying-V aircraft, 2017] with a 10mm resolution requires multiple solutions to linear systems of equations with many billions of unknowns. This presents challenges both regarding memory usage and computation time.    
To address these challenges, we propose a matrix-free linear solver, accelerated with GPUs. Throughout the domain, identical trilinear finite-elements (voxels) are used, thus only one unique element matrix needs to be calculated. Next, sectors of 8×8×8 voxels are used to model the entire geometry of the airplane, preventing redundant computations in regions that are not part of the airplane. Within each sector, regularity of the data is kept, thus ensuring coalesced memory access patterns for a high utilization of GPUs.    
This, together with multigrid preconditioning and multi-GPU strategies, results in the ability to perform extremely large-scale topology optimization at unprecedented speeds. The technique is showcased with optimization of the Flying V airplane.

They are commonly used as high-level building blocks for data processing pipelines; however, they typically lack extended settings of underlying optimization solvers or monitor convergence. Currently used machine learning applications perform parallelism on a task level or orchestration based on multiple container instances of an application running in Kubernetes or Microsoft Azure.  In our contribution, we will present a software solution for distributed machine learning supporting computation on multiple GPUs running on the top of the PETSc framework (https://petsc.org/), which we will demonstrate in applications related to natural hazard localizations and detections employing supervised uncertainties modelling. It is called PERMON (http://permon.vsb.cz) and is designed for convex optimization using quadratic programming, and its extension PermonSVM implements maximal-margin classifier approaches associated with support vector machines (SVMs). Although deep learning (DL) is getting popular in recent years, SVMs are still applicable. Unlike DL, an underlying optimization problem associated with SVM is convex, and PermonSVM computes it in a deterministic way (no batch processing) through no intrinsic limitations imposed by a single node memory, convergence to a global minimum is guaranteed. Moreover, an attained model can be easily explainable.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75758' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1573' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1573)' class='star'><span class='star1573'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (E103)</b> Radu Serban, A GPU-Based DEM Solver for Large-Scale Granular Simulations <span id='bitlink-1444'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1444)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1444' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1444)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A GPU-Based DEM Solver for Large-Scale Granular Simulations</b><br />Radu Serban<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-346.html'>Recent Developments on GPU-Based Solvers in High-Performance Computing - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>We present a new generation GPU-based solver for large scale granular dynamics simulations, using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). This simulation infrastructure is a step beyond our current DEM solver available in the open-source multi-physics package Chrono. The new solver uses two GPUs to accelerate the simulation, one dedicated to collision detection and related kinematic calculations, the other dedicated to advancing the dynamics of the granular material.  We use just-in-time compiling to allow customization and to leverage the specific architecture of the execution hardware. Finally, the solver leverages CUB, an efficient CUDA utility package for parallel primitives.  The resulting solver, distributed under a BSD license, provides an open-source efficient solution for DEM problems with millions of degrees of freedom.  After a brief description of the underlying methods, we discuss the implementation of the new solver and illustrate its capabilities on several large-scale DEM problems. One of these is simulation of extraterrestrial rovers over deformable terrain; the terrain is a granular dynamics representation of the Glenn Research Center lunar soil simulant \#1 (GRC-1), designed and manufactured to match geotechnical properties of lunar soil.  The capabilities and performance of this new solver promise to enable, on relatively inexpensive hardware, simulations of a scale previously possible only on supercomputers.

This talk will serve as an overview of this challenge, and will present one possible remedy: the use of localized bases to accelerate and stabilize kernel methods.   This will include a recent history of localization of kernels and conclude with very recent progress and accompanying improvements to a variety of kernel based methods for solving PDEs on manifolds. These include new stable and efficient multigrid methods for Galerkin problems using localized kernel bases, as well as improvements to kernel-FD and asymmetric collocation for time dependent and independent PDEs. The talk is based on recent joint work with  Christian Rieger and other researchers who will be acknowledged during the talk.

More specifically we combine principal component analysis (PCA) with kernel regression. In order to analyze the resulting regression errors, a novel stability result of kernel regression with respect to the Wasserstein distance is derived. This allows us to bound errors that occur when perturbed input data is used to fit a kernel function. We combine the stability result with known estimates from the literature on both principal component analysis and kernel regression to obtain convergence rates for the two-step procedure. This talk is based on joint work with Stephan Eckstein and Mathias Trabs.

We study a class  of series kernels applicable for interpolation of arbitrary scattered data on $M^d$  by a linear combination of shifts, where $M^d$  is a compact Riemannian manifold.  A class of functions for which the resulting interpolation problem is uniquely  solvable for any distinct point sets is the class of strictly  positive definite kernels. For kernels possessing a certain series expansion in  eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M^d$  , we derive a characterisation of this class. We give more specific results for two-point homogeneous  manifolds and the sphere.  For the special case of $S^{d-1}$  , we study the connection between geometric  properties of the kernel and the coefficients in the series expansion. Examples  of such geometric properties are axial-symmetry and invariance under parity.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75783' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1613' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1613)' class='star'><span class='star1613'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM (E107)</b> Wolfgang Erb, Numerical Schemes for Efficient Kernel-Based Methods on Graphs <span id='bitlink-1481'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1481)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1481' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1481)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Numerical Schemes for Efficient Kernel-Based Methods on Graphs</b><br />Wolfgang Erb<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-356.html'>Efficient Kernel Methods - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>Important kernels in classical settings can be formulated explicitly and implemented directly for interpolation or classification purposes. On irregular graph domains this is in general not possible. Kernels that describe diffusion processes or characterize smoothness classes on graphs are not accessible in closed form and have to be calculated numerically. Often, these kernels can be characterized and computed as matrix functions of the graph Laplacian, as for instance the diffusion kernel which is the exponential of the Laplacian. Calculating these matrix functions becomes prohibitive if the size of the graph is large and if the spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian is required.     
In this talk, we will present efficient numerical schemes for the calculation of kernels on large graphs that avoid the spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian. We will focus on two numerical concepts that help to reduce the computational load: the first idea is the usage of Krylov subspace methods tailored to the needs of kernel methods on graphs. These iterative methods approximate relevant parts of the kernels by low-cost matrix polynomials of the graph Laplacian. The second idea exploits local kernel approximation on subdomains of the graph via a partition of unity method that merges the local approximants. We will present some theoretical aspects of these cost-efficient numerical schemes as well as numerical tests demonstrating their benefits.

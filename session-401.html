We employ this framework to design scalable routines for two key sparse kernels arising in parallel minimum spanning forest (MSF) and single-source shortest path (SSSP) algorithms. In particular, we target the hooking step of the Awerbuch-Shiloach MSF algorithm and the nearest neighbor search leveraged by the low hop emulator SSSP construction (Andoni, Stein, Zhong, STOC 20). We introduce a multilinear kernel that operates on an adjacency matrix and two vectors to eliminate a write bottleneck common to both steps. This kernel updates vertices by simultaneously using information from an edge and its two adjacent vertices. We implement these routines with Cyclops, a distributed-memory library for generalized sparse tensor algebra. We analyze the parallel scalability of our implementations on the Stampede2 supercomputer.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75881' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1822' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1822)' class='star'><span class='star1822'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D402)</b> Lukas Gianinazzi, Parallel Graph Algorithms for Fixed-Parameter Tractable Problems <span id='bitlink-1667'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1667)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1667' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1667)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Parallel Graph Algorithms for Fixed-Parameter Tractable Problems</b><br />Lukas Gianinazzi<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-401.html'>Emerging Techniques for Scalable Graph Processing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Although many useful graph problems, such as subgraph isomorphism, are NP-hard in general, they are solvable in polynomial time for certain families of sparse graphs. As these algorithms might still require significant resources, providing parallel algorithms can further raise the scale of problems solvable within a given time limit.   For example, subgraph isomorphism becomes tractable on planar graphs and other apex-minor-free families of graphs. Moreover, searching for maximum cliques becomes tractable in planar and other bounded-degeneracy graphs.   This talk discusses our recent advances in parallel algorithms for these problems. Our algorithms must avoid large sequential graph traversals and instead quickly break apart the graphs into independent parts.   We provide algorithms whose work grows only linearly with the size of the target graph and whose depth grows poly-logarithmically with the size of the target graph.   These results imply more work-efficient algorithms for other problems, such as vertex connectivity in planar graphs.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75881' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1823' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1823)' class='star'><span class='star1823'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D402)</b> Jessica Shi, Theoretically and Practically Efficient Parallel Nucleus Decomposition <span id='bitlink-1668'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1668)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1668' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1668)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Theoretically and Practically Efficient Parallel Nucleus Decomposition</b><br />Jessica Shi<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-401.html'>Emerging Techniques for Scalable Graph Processing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>This paper studies the nucleus decomposition problem, which has been shown to be useful in finding dense substructures in graphs. We present a novel parallel algorithm that is efficient both in theory and in practice. Our algorithm achieves a work complexity matching the best sequential algorithm while also having low depth (parallel running time), which significantly improves upon the only existing parallel nucleus decomposition algorithm (Sariyuce et al., PVLDB 2018). The key to the theoretical efficiency of our algorithm is the use of a theoretically-efficient parallel algorithms for clique listing and bucketing. We introduce several new practical optimizations, including a new multi-level hash table structure to store information on cliques space-efficiently and a technique for traversing this structure cache-efficiently. On a 30-core machine with two-way hyper-threading on real-world graphs, we achieve up to a 55x speedup over the state-of-the-art parallel nucleus decomposition algorithm by Sariyuce et al., and up to a 40x self-relative parallel speedup. We are able to efficiently compute larger nucleus decompositions than prior work on several million-scale graphs for the first time.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75881' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1824' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1824)' class='star'><span class='star1824'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D402)</b> Muhammed Rafeek K V, Observability of Consensus of Multi-Agent Networks Under Signed Laplacian Dynamics <span id='bitlink-1669'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1669)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1669' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1669)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Observability of Consensus of Multi-Agent Networks Under Signed Laplacian Dynamics</b><br />Muhammed Rafeek K V<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-401.html'>Emerging Techniques for Scalable Graph Processing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Signed multi-agent networks have been an area of recent interest in networks and control community as they involve both cooperative and competitive interactions among its agents. This work establishes the observability conditions of consensus problem of such networks when their agents agrees on signed Laplacian dynamics on a continuous time-scale. The interconnection topology is time-invariant. Under leader--follower framework,  where, the agents of the network are classified into leaders and followers, the necessary and sufficient observability conditions are obtained. Graphical interpretations are provided to gain more insight on the interactions among the agents of the network  and network topology. In addition, the developed results are generic, in the sense that they are not only applicable to signed networks but also to unsigned networks, since unsigned networks are the particular case of signed networks that only contain cooperative agents. Furthermore, we prove that, if the signed multi-agent network is structurally balanced, then the obtained observability conditions will become  equivalent to that of the corresponding unsigned multi-agent network, under some special leaders selection. Numerical  examples are given to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.

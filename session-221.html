The interplay of phase behavior, fluid dynamics, and interfacial thermodynamics in complex fluids gives rise to interesting structure-property relations such as interfacial assembly and kinetically arrested phase morphologies. One particular example of kinetically arrested liquid mixtures are interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) that emerge due to colloidal jamming during spinodal decomposition, resulting in an out-of-equilibrium liquid morphology with gel-like properties.    
Computational modeling and simulations can help gain a fundamental understanding of the structure and dynamics of particle-stabilized emulsions. In this talk, I will present results from lattice Boltzmann simulations of binary fluid mixtures with anisotropic suspended particles. Magnetic particles can be used for controlled deformation and coalescence of particle-stabilized droplets by applied fields. I will further present simulations of bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels. The simulations shed light on the effect of magnetic fields on the domain size and morphology of liquid mesophases. Potential applications include the development of control mechanisms that enable design of fluid templates with tailored structure, which can be leveraged to fabricate porous membranes and fibers for filtration and separation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75539' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1010' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1010)' class='star'><span class='star1010'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (E106)</b> James E.

Sprittles<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-221.html'>Multiphase Flows at the Microscale - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>Understanding the stability of thin liquid films and their potential to spontaneously rupture is crucial for a wide range of fluid-based applications.  Over the last thirty years, there has been significant progress in understanding the stability of ultra thin films, where disjoining pressure creates a linear instability that leads to a hole forming (the so-called `spinodal regime'). Notably, it is known that thermal capillary nanowaves, driven by Brownian motion in the bulk, play a key role in speeding up this instability.    
Here, we consider an alternative and complementary possibility - that the formation of rogue nanowaves can lead to the rupture of linearly stable films.  Experimentally, such a `thermal regime' has been observed, but a theoretical framework and predictive capability for this regime is absent.    
In this talk, it will be shown that the film's dynamics can be described by a stochastic thin film equation, which naturally captures the generation of nanowaves and, once solved computationally, predicts the rupture of linearly stable nanofilms.  Then, using large deviation theory, which has recently been applied to model rogue ocean waves, we are able to formulate a theory which describes the most likely route to rupture and the timescale associated with this process, which compare well to our direct simulations.  Finally, comparisons to experimental analyses and molecular simulations will be presented and directions of future research discussed.

The associated computational challenges motivate the investigation of numerical techniques that can decouple the time integration of the governing equations in the liquid electrolyte and the solid phase (active materials and current collectors). First, it is shown that semi-discretisation in space of the governing equations leads to a system of index-$1$ differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Then, a new generation of strategies for multi-domain integration is presented, enabling high-order adaptive coupling in time of both domains. A simple $1$D LIB code is implemented as a demonstrator of the new strategy for the simulation of charge, discharge, and relaxation. The integration of the decoupled subsystems is performed with high-order accurate implicit nonlinear solvers. A fully coupled monolithic time integration scheme is also presented as reference. The accuracy of the space discretisation is assessed by comparing numerical results to analytical solutions. Then, temporal convergence studies demonstrate the accuracy of the new multi-domain coupling approach. Finally, considerations on its computational efficiency are also discussed. It is believed that this new approach will constitute a key ingredient for full-scale $3$D simulations based on actual electrode microstructures.

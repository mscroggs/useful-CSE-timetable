The interface is typically a manifold of co-dimension 1 or 2 with the latter being the case in reduced-order models. The mixed-dimensional nature of the models, the coupling between the subsystems and the large ranges of physical parameters found in the applications of interest present a challenge for designing efficient numerical schemes.  In this talk, we develop monolithic preconditioners leading to order optimal and parameter robust solvers for coupled multiphysics models where the coupling is realized through a dedicated Lagrange multiplier on the interface as well as for the formulations where it is enforced weakly. A crucial component in the analysis is correctly posing the interface conditions between the subsystems. In particular, we show that robust preconditioning requires weighted fractional order Sobolev spaces and their intersections. The performance of the preconditioners will be illustrated in biomedical applications in cardiac and brain mechanics.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75747' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1534' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1534)' class='star'><span class='star1534'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM (D404)</b> Joseph P.

Examples include hybrid discontinuous Galerkin methods, where function spaces defined only over the facets of the mesh are introduced, and problems with boundary or interface conditions enforced by Lagrange multipliers. Solving such problems for real-world applications typically requires large scale simulations to provide sufficient accuracy.    
We present recent developments in the FEniCSx core libraries, inspired by earlier work in FEniCS [C. Daversin-Catty et al., Abstractions and Automated Algorithms for Mixed Domain Finite Element Methods, ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 47, 4, 31], that allows mixed dimensional problems to be solved in an efficient manner. Subdomains, of possibly differing topological dimensions, can be created by specifying a subset of mesh entities, yielding a submesh. Forms can then be assembled involving functions defined over different meshes. The relationships between the meshes can be nested, and high-order geometry is supported. Parallelism and scalability are at the heart of the design philosophy, and code prototyped on a laptop can be deployed on an HPC system without modification.    
We present scaling results for several applications, including hybridised discontinuous Galerkin methods and Lagrange multiplier problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75747' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1535' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1535)' class='star'><span class='star1535'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM (D404)</b> Patrick Zulian, Immersed Mesh Methods for the Solution of Coupled Finite Element Problems <span id='bitlink-1409'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1409)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1409' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1409)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Immersed Mesh Methods for the Solution of Coupled Finite Element Problems</b><br />Patrick Zulian<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-338.html'>High Performance Computing Tools for Mixed Dimensional Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>The ever-increasing computational power of modern supercomputers enables the numerical simulation of complex and coupled large-scale multiphysics problems, e.g., arising from fluid-structure interaction, or geometrically complex interactions, e.g., in contact mechanics.  Common to these coupled and complex problems is the need for the transfer of data or information between the different models, meshes, or approximation spaces.  The transfer of discrete fields, such as stresses, pressure, displacements, or velocities, might be required both along surfaces or within volumes.  Variational transfer techniques might also play an important role at the level of the discretization, e.g., within non-conforming domain decomposition or mortar methods for the transfer along surfaces, or on the level of the solution method, e.g., within multigrid or multi-level methods for the transfer between different volume meshes. In this talk, we introduce our parallel variational transfer technique and its application to a wide variety of problems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75747' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1536' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1536)' class='star'><span class='star1536'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM (D404)</b> Ngoc Mai Monica Huynh, BDDC Preconditioners for Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin Discretizations in Cardiac Electrophysiology <span id='bitlink-1410'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1410)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1410' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1410)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>BDDC Preconditioners for Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin Discretizations in Cardiac Electrophysiology</b><br />Ngoc Mai Monica Huynh<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-338.html'>High Performance Computing Tools for Mixed Dimensional Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>The drive to better understand complex phenomena like cardiac functions has led to mathematical models that are able to describe the multiscale structure and dynamics of the heart. The numerical simulation of these complex cardiac models is very challenging since it requires high-resolution space and time discretizations, as well as numerical tools that can handle natural discontinuities (for instance, disconnected cells).    
Here we consider a cardiac microscopic model, which is able to describe a cell-by-cell framework. We show how physiological discontinuities can be naturally included through a standard space discretization.    
Then, we build an ad-hoc non-overlapping domain decomposition preconditioner for the solution of the associated algebraic system. This preconditioner relies on the one introduced by [Dryja et al. (2007)], but differs since it handles a global discontinuous solution across the domain.  We prove theoretical convergence of the proposed solver and we provide several numerical tests that show scalability and robustness, as well as optimality.

We present a family of algorithmic ideas where computationally cheap iterative approximations are used to solve most instances of aspects of the code. Where convergence isn’t reached we fall back to a more expensive but robust method.  This pattern allows us to take advantage of modern parallel architectures.    
Geometry distance checks are calculated using a distance minimisation algorithm.  The precision of the result from this minimisation can be tuned to produce a result only as precise as needed.    
We support triangulated particles with efficient implicit DEM code using a multiresolution and multiprecision hierarchy. Early iterations of the implicit solve yield an initial guess and thus reduce the number of later, more expensive iterations that are required to converge to the correct solution.    
Finally, we show a local time stepping scheme where the time step size is selected optimistically.  Where this results in invalid physical states the state of each particle is rolled back and a more simple method (half the time step size until a valid state is found) is used.  The optimistic selection of time step size for local clusters of particles can end up advancing some particles too far and missing interactions with new particles entering the local cluster.  In this case we roll back to the time of the new interaction and resimulate from there.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75747' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

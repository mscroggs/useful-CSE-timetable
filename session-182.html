As such, it is often important to find experimental design conditions that maximize the value of these experiments. Model-based Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) provides a rigorous framework for identifying the ideal design by leveraging a mathematical model that simulates the experimental outcomes. We achieve this by quantifying the value of an experiment using the expected information gain (EIG). This quantity is typically evaluated numerically using a double-nested Monte Carlo (DNMC) estimator. However, DNMC can be prohibitively expensive when using a complex and computationally intensive model. We propose a multi-fidelity approach to accelerate the OED process, in which an ensemble of EIG estimators of varying accuracy and cost (e.g. from lower-fidelity models that use simplified physics, coarsened meshes, or partial convergence) are combined into a single estimator via the approximate control variate method. By leveraging the accuracy-cost tradeoffs of the available models, the multi-fidelity estimator achieves lower variance in estimating the EIG criterion. This approach is demonstrated on a nonlinear benchmark and in designing  turbulent flow experiments for inferring the Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) turbulence closure model parameters.

Various real-world science and engineering applications involve modeling complex systems based on insufficient data, where the resulting uncertain model may be used for subsequent tasks such as prediction or control. The ability to accurately estimate the impact of the uncertainty present in the current model on the expected performance of these tasks is crucial for optimal experimental design (OED), as it allows one to prioritize experiments that can effectively reduce the model uncertainty that practically matters. While the efficacy of MOCU-based OED has been demonstrated in several problems, the high computational cost for MOCU estimation has been a significant obstacle to its application. In this talk, we present machine learning (ML) strategies that can remarkably accelerate MOCU computation, thereby substantially scale-up MOCU-based OED capabilities.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75481' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk832' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(832)' class='star'><span class='star832'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM (G101)</b> James Oreluk, Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design for High-Dimensional Combustion Models <span id='bitlink-768'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(768)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-768' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(768)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design for High-Dimensional Combustion Models</b><br />James Oreluk<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-182.html'>Optimal Experimental Design</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Many scientific and engineering experiments are developed to study specific questions of interest. Unfortunately, time and budget constraints make operating these experiments at a wide range of conditions intractable, thus limiting the amount of data collected. In this talk, we consider an application of Bayesian optimal experimental design to identify conditions that are expected to be most informative, measured by the expected information gain. We focus on inferring specific parameters of a chemically reacting system subject to both parametric and model uncertainty. A physics-based model was developed to simulate the gas-phase reactions occurring between highly reactive intermediate species in a high-pressure photolysis reactor coupled to a mass spectrometer. The measured time-of-flight mass spectrum evolves in both time and energy producing a high-dimensional output at each design. We discuss how accurate low-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional mass spectrum are necessary for computing the expected information gain. Additionally, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore over the constrained design space. We present our results, discuss trade-offs during the optimization, and outline a workflow for efficiently computing optimal experimental designs for high-dimensional models.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75481' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk833' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(833)' class='star'><span class='star833'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM (G101)</b> Xun Huan, Reinforcement Learning Framework for Bayesian Sequential Optimal Experimental Design <span id='bitlink-769'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(769)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-769' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(769)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reinforcement Learning Framework for Bayesian Sequential Optimal Experimental Design</b><br />Xun Huan<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-182.html'>Optimal Experimental Design</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Experiments are indispensable for learning and developing models in engineering and science. When experiments are expensive, a careful design of these limited data-acquisition opportunities can be immensely beneficial. Optimal experimental design, while leveraging the predictive capabilities of a simulation model, provides a rigorous framework to systematically quantify and maximize the value of experiments. We focus on designing a finite sequence of experiments, seeking fully optimal design policies (strategies) that can (a) adapt to newly collected data during the sequence (i.e. feedback) and (b) anticipate future changes (i.e. lookahead). We cast this sequential decision-making problem in a Bayesian setting with information-based utilities, and solve it numerically via policy gradient methods from reinforcement learning. In particular, we directly parameterize the policies and value functions by neural networksâ€”thus adopting an actor-critic approachâ€”and improve them using gradient estimates produced from simulated design and observation sequences. The overall method is demonstrated on an algebraic benchmark and a sensor movement application for source inversion. The results provide intuitive insights on the benefits of feedback and lookahead, and indicate substantial computational advantages compared to previous numerical approaches based on approximate dynamical programming.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75481' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

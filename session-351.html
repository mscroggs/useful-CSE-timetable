<h2>Computational Approaches for Multiscale Problems and Their Applications</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1587' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1587)' class='star'><span class='star1587'>&star;</span></a> <b>1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM (E106)</b> Rutger Biezemans, Non-Intrusive Implementation of Multiscale Finite Element Methods <span id='bitlink-1457'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1457)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1457' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1457)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Non-Intrusive Implementation of Multiscale Finite Element Methods</b><br />Rutger Biezemans<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-351.html'>Computational Approaches for Multiscale Problems and Their Applications</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>The multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) is a finite element method (FEM) that allows to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with highly oscillatory coefficients on a coarse mesh, i.e. a mesh with elements of size much larger than the characteristic scale of the heterogeneities. To do so, MsFEMs use pre-computed basis functions, adapted to the differential operator, thereby taking into account the small scales of the problem.     
Standard FEM software is based on problem-independent (e.g. polynomial) basis functions, so that the resolution of the FEM can be automated for a large variety of problems. Such software cannot easily be adapted to deal with specific basis functions for each new problem; the MsFEM approach is intrusive. In this talk, we shall propose adaptations of the MsFEM that allow for a non-intrusive approximation strategy: our MsFEM leads to an effective PDE with slowly varying coefficients, hence can be solved by means of standard FEM software. We hope this will facilitate the implementation of the MsFEM outside academic environments.

It is well known that this equation has important time invariants such as the total energy of the system. Preserving the energy under numerical discretization can be of great significance in many practical situations. In this talk we consider numerical approximations of the GPE based on multiscale approaches. More precise, we choose a generalized finite element space which is based on the localised orthogonal decomposition method and which allows to capture the energy with a 6th order accuracy. Paired with energy-preserving time integrators we demonstrate how such an approach can lead to an efficient solver for the GPE and so for simulating the dynamics of BECs on larger time scales.

In the parabolic case, where  the microscopic scales are additionally periodic, the heterogeneous multiscale method provides a framework for efficiently solving such problems. We consider the critical case where the cell problem is also a parabolic one and we replace the periodic boundary and time conditions by Dirichlet boundary and initial values.  Further, we give a detailed a priori error analysis of the fully discretized, i.e., in space and time for both the macroscopic and the cell problem, method.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75776' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1590' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1590)' class='star'><span class='star1590'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (E106)</b> Nicolas Clozeau, Optimal Computational Boundary Conditions for Linear Elliptic Equations in Random Media <span id='bitlink-1460'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1460)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1460' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1460)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimal Computational Boundary Conditions for Linear Elliptic Equations in Random Media</b><br />Nicolas Clozeau<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-351.html'>Computational Approaches for Multiscale Problems and Their Applications</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>We consider a model problem of conductivity in a random heterogenous medium taking the form of a uniformly elliptic equation with random coefficient. We will present in this talk two recent works proposing high accuracy methods to compute the solution based on optimal computational boundary conditions. First, we consider the case of highly oscillatory coefficient fields, putting the problem in the homogenization regime. We will describe a method for computing the homogenised matrix based on representative volume elements with periodic boundary conditions. We will compare two different approches: periodising the realisations versus periodising the law of the coefficients, and explain how the second approach leads to a higher accuracy. This is a joint work with Marc Josien, Felix Otto and Qiang Xu. Second, we will consider the problem of computing the electrical field generated by a charge distribution localized on scale $\ell$ in a situation where the medium is only known in a box of diameter $L>\ell$ around the support of the charge. We study the artificial Dirichlet boundary condition proposed in [Wang, Otto, Ju,Optimal artificial boundary conditions based on second-order correctors for three dimensional random elliptic media] in the case where the medium is a sample from a stationary ensemble with slowly decaying correlations.This is a joint work with Lihan Wang and Quinn Winters.

Dissipative weak solutions (DWS) have demonstrated their capability analytically and numerically to be the right solution concept to the Euler equations of gas dynamics when strong solutions are not attainable. In this talk, I will talk about the notion of DWS in the context of Euler equations. Furthermore, in this talk, I will present a convergence analysis of the MUSCL scheme and a high-order finite method, the spectral difference method. Namely, we show that structure preserving properties, such as positivity preservation and entropy inequality hold. We demonstrate how to ensure them and prove the convergence of our multidimensional high-order scheme via dissipative weak solutions. Lastly, we demonstrate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations of turbulent flows.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75776' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

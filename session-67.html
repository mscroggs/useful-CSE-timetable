The true solution is approximated by an expansion of deterministic modes weighted by stochastic coefficients, all time-dependent, mimicking a truncated Karhunen-Loewen expansion; evolution equations are available for the deterministic and stochastic modes. Time-integration of the DLR equations may be challenging as the DLR structure may lead to additional stiffness in the system. Recently, we have shown that a projector-splitting scheme, combined with standard first-order time integration of the operator, leads to a fully discrete DLR solution of a random parabolic PDE that verifies the same norm bound properties as a standard (non-DLR) discrete parabolic system, and is not affected by the additional stiffness in the equations. In this talk, we propose extensions of the projector-splitting scheme, including a practical Strang scheme as well as other time-marching schemes which improve on the accuracy of the approximation and its numerical stability compared to the explicit integrators while not being overly expensive.

However, if the spatial domain is high-dimensional or the dynamics are transport dominated with local features such as waves, then just uniformly sampling collocation points becomes intractable because each collocation point entails at least one residual evaluation in each iteration of the training. In this work, we propose an active learning scheme that adapts collocation points to follow the dynamics described by the partial differential equations. This means that the solution dynamics are leveraged to adapt collocation points to where the residual is high. In experiments with high-dimensional evolution equations and equations that transport local features such as waves, the proposed active scheme learns accurate approximations of the solutions from few samples whereas traditional collocation methods based on static sampling fail to provide meaningful predictions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75310' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk306' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(306)' class='star'><span class='star306'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (G107)</b> Cheng Huang, Enabling Predictive Reduced-Order Models for Turbulent Reacting Flows Using Adaptive Model Order Reduction <span id='bitlink-282'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(282)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-282' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(282)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Enabling Predictive Reduced-Order Models for Turbulent Reacting Flows Using Adaptive Model Order Reduction</b><br />Cheng Huang<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-67.html'>Nonlinear Approximations of Latent Dynamics for Model Reduction and Beyond - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Even with exascale computing capabilities, high-fidelity, full-scale simulations of turbulent combustion in realistic applications like rocket combustion remain computationally expensive and inaccessible for many-query applications. Projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) methods have shown promise in greatly improving computational efficiency. However, classical MOR methods that seek reduced solutions in low-dimensional subspaces fail for realistic turbulent combustion problems because reacting flows feature extreme stiffness, sharp gradients, and multi-scale transport, which pose great challenges in deriving effective low-order representations and developing predictive reduced-order models (ROMs). In this talk, we introduce an adaptive reduced-order modeling technique which updates the low-dimensional space, thus circumventing representation barriers faced by static reduced-dimensional spaces. The method leverages model-form preserving least-squares projections with variable transformation (MP-LSVT) for improved robustness of ROM and adapts the low-dimensional subspaces based on the evaluated dynamics during online calculations to enable predictive ROMs for turbulent reacting flows.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75310' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

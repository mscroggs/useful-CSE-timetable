These methods have also found their way into the field of control engineering, especially in model predictive control. However, compared to the creation of surrogate models for autonomous models (without control input), the building of data-based models for controlled systems is typically much more difficult and data hungry. To address these issues, in this talk, we present a framework which is based on a discretization of the control inputs such that modeling techniques for autonomous systems can be used without adaptations. As a result, the modeling effort and also the amount of required data can be reduced. Relaxation and rounding techniques from the area of mixed-integer control are then used to solve the newly derived discrete control problem. We verify the presented approach with various examples where we use different techniques to build the data-based models.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75257' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk187' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(187)' class='star'><span class='star187'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (D508)</b> Tommaso Vanzan, A Multigrid Method for Challenging Optimal Control Problems Constrained by Random PDEs <span id='bitlink-177'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(177)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-177' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(177)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Multigrid Method for Challenging Optimal Control Problems Constrained by Random PDEs</b><br />Tommaso Vanzan<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-41.html'>Advances in Optimal Control and Shape Optimization Concerning Applications in Physics and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>In this contribution we present a multigrid method to solve the full-space optimality systems that arise in Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) constrained by random Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).  These optimality systems are of very large dimension, and are often characterized by $N$ state PDEs, $N$ adjoint PDEs, and a single optimality condition, where $N$ is the total number of collocation points used to discretize the probability space.  Our approach is based on a collective smoother that requires the solution (possibly in parallel) of several reduced linear systems, each of dimension $2(N+1)\times 2(N+1)$, which can be achieved with optimal linear complexity.  The efficiency of the multigrid scheme is tested on several problems, including a simple unconstrained linear-quadratic OCP, an OCP with box constraints and a $L^1$ penalization on the control, and a risk-adverse OCP involving the smoothed CVaR risk measure.  In addition, the multigrid solver presented is robust against several important parameters of the model problems considered.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75257' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk188' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(188)' class='star'><span class='star188'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (D508)</b> Fortino Garcia, Risk Neutral Quantum Optimal Control Using Quadratic Approximations <span id='bitlink-178'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(178)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-178' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(178)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Risk Neutral Quantum Optimal Control Using Quadratic Approximations</b><br />Fortino Garcia<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-41.html'>Advances in Optimal Control and Shape Optimization Concerning Applications in Physics and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>For the design of quantum logic gates -- the fundamental building block of quantum algorithms -- achieving high target fidelities is essential to the success of an algorithm. However, current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era quantum devices are typically polluted by noise. This work investigates performing optimal control of closed quantum systems for logic gate synthesis under time-dependent uncertainty. We consider an objective function that is the mean of the trace infidelity measure, leading to a risk-neutral optimal control problem. Rather than using a Monte Carlo estimate for the risk-neutral objective, we consider taking a quadratic approximation of the objective with respect to the uncertainty as a proxy. This leads to an explicit expression for the mean of the control objective in terms of the trace of the (preconditioned) Hessian with respect to the uncertainty, for which we leverage trace estimators to approximate with a modest number of Hessian-vector products. Finally, we reformulate the risk-neutral optimization problem as a constrained optimization problem in which we employ a quasi-Newton method to minimize the quadratic approximation with respect to the control. This approach yields a method for which the computation of the risk-neutral objective and its gradient (with respect to the control) has a cost that depends only on the number of trace estimators used which can be chosen independently of the dimension of the control and uncertainty.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75257' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk189' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(189)' class='star'><span class='star189'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (D508)</b> Carlos Esteve-Yag&#252;e, Line-of-Sight Based Games in a Domain with Obstacles <span id='bitlink-179'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(179)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-179' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(179)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Line-of-Sight Based Games in a Domain with Obstacles</b><br />Carlos Esteve-Yag&#252;e<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-41.html'>Advances in Optimal Control and Shape Optimization Concerning Applications in Physics and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>We consider a pursuit-evasion game in which a moving pursuer seeks to maintain visual contact with an evader which is moving in an environment containing obstacles. We introduce a new visibility function to determine the region of the domain in which the line of sight between the players is not cut by any obstacle. Then, we use this approach to analyze the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation associated to the game, especially near the boundary, where the solution happens to be discontinuous. Finally, we show how the new visibility function can be used to design (sub)optimal feedback policies, which approximate the optimal one given by the (HJI) equation, and are computationally much more efficient. This is a joint work with Richard Tsai (UT Austin) and Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb (University of Cambridge).

One of the main issues in this framework is the selection of the stepsize: classical globalization strategies such as linesearch are not feasible in the multi-agent setting, while employing a fixed stepsize is known to often cause the method to be slow, and usually requires the knowledge of the regularity constants of the problem, which can be hard to estimate distributedly. We propose a distributed Inexact Newton method that combines the penalty formulation of the problem with Jacobi Overrelaxation method, and uses an adaptive stepsize that can be computed without a priori knowedge of the constants of the problem. Under suitbale regularity assumptions over the objective function and on the connectivity of the underlying network, we prove both global and local fast convergence of the proposed method, with convergence order that depends on the choice of the parameters of the method. We also presents a set of numerical results that shows the comparison between the proposed algorithm and several methods from the literature.

These problems are often ill-posed, and even with linear forward models, the rank-deficient forward matrices may only be implicitly available through computationally demanding simulators. Typically, some of these challenges can be addressed via regularization, but this biases inference and thus affects UQ guarantees. Thus, standard statistical solutions to these types of problems are often either intractable, unreliable or fail to use relevant information. We propose that some of these challenges can be handled by simply incorporating physical constraints, but this approach leads to challenges of its own. In this talk, I present optimization-based confidence intervals related to the strict bounds interval methodology, addressing some of the aforementioned challenges by incorporating physical constraints. In particular, I present the intervals through the lens of the log-likelihood ratio, allowing connections to constrained inference. Finally, I discuss a few physical science applications.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75505' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk904' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(904)' class='star'><span class='star904'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (G108)</b> Eric M.

Usually, the design development is divided  into two different phases. The first phase is to determine the pre-optimal design. Through the use of numerical software, the best design is chosen considering some ideal performances to be achieved.  The second phase is to certify through full-scale experiments that the design determined previously is valid. In this way, the post-optimal design is specified. This second phase is the most costly one. In that respect, manufacturers seek to lower the utilization of full-scale experiments. Optimal Uncertainty Quantification (OUQ) is a powerful mathematical tool which can be used to rigorously bound the probability of exceeding a given performance threshold for uncertain operational conditions or system  characteristics. This mathematical framework can be very computationally demanding. The use of a metamodel is highly desirable. Moreover, the robustness of the bounding obtained in this framework will strongly depend on the quality of this metamodel. Therefore, one needs to build a metamodel which is quick to evaluate and as accurate as possible. An algorithm, named Spectral Kernel Ridge Regression, is introduced to design kernels from available data in Gaussian process regression surrogate modeling techniques. This algorithm is illustrated on several numerical examples.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75505' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk905' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(905)' class='star'><span class='star905'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G108)</b> Aniket Jivani, Uncertainty Quantification for Random Field Quantities Using Multi-Fidelity Karhunen-Lo&#232;ve Expansions with Active Learning <span id='bitlink-833'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(833)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-833' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(833)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Uncertainty Quantification for Random Field Quantities Using Multi-Fidelity Karhunen-Lo&#232;ve Expansions with Active Learning</b><br />Aniket Jivani<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-198.html'>Robust Uncertainty Quantification and Inference - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Sampling-based uncertainty quantification is often computationally prohibitive when using high-fidelity (HF) models. One approach to alleviate this cost is by building multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate models that combine a small number of HF simulations with a larger number of less expensive lower-fidelity (LF) simulations. We focus on using Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansions (KLEs) as surrogate models, which are based on low-rank spectral approximations that can effectively characterize random field (e.g., spatio-temporal) quantities. We build KLEs in a multi-fidelity manner by retaining the connections to the physical sources of uncertainty through the use of polynomial chaos expansions inside an LF KLE and an additive correction KLE. Predictions can then be generated rapidly for any input parameter value, and greatly accelerate the UQ computations. When additional high-fidelity simulations can be performed to further improve the surrogate model, we propose an active-learning framework to strategically select new simulation points in the input parameter space. We achieve this by using a Gaussian Process (GP) to represent the current MF surrogate error, and use Expected Improvement to find the point with the highest expected surrogate error for performing the next HF simulation. We show the advantages of the overall method on benchmark problems and field quantities from a turbulent round jet application.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75505' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

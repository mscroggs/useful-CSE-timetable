Exascale ESMs are expected to open up a new range of opportunities, from increasing model resolution and larger ensemble simulations to the integration of new components to increase the accuracy of our predictions. To make this possible, exascale supercomputers will rely on accelerators and specialised hardware. While diversity for hardware gives more flexibility for co-design, it will increase the complexity of our ESMs.     
The exascale challenges are: leveraging accelerators, coupling models, ensuring accuracy and stability, dealing with increased I/O, enabling big-data workflows, etc. Solutions to these challenges must also guarantee future-proofing codes, pursue performance-portability across pre and exascale architectures, domain-specific languages and code sustainability. Most applications will require some degree of rewriting to expose more parallelism, and many face severe strong-scaling challenges if they are to effectively progress to exascale. Additionally, ESMs are expected to be performant in terms of both computational and energy efficiency.     
This talk will include a exascale overview for Earth modeling, covering main challenges to achieve the exascalw goal for our ESMs and the range of solutions adopted by the community to be ready for the new era.

The Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM), a global model with an icosahedral grid system, has been developed and used for two decades. The first grand challenge simulation of NICAM was global cloud-resolving (here, 3.5 km mesh) simulation around 2005, and its extension toward climate scale is now in sight with Fugaku. The value of such climate simulation is guaranteed by a series of recent model improvements to better simulate both mean state and disturbances. We are also revealing the climatological performance of the ocean-coupled version of NICAM through a series of seasonal to decadal simulations. Another important challenge is an O($10^3$) ensemble global prediction experiment with 14 km mesh for better forecast of tropical cyclones over a week. As a resolution-intensive approach, we are trying to run NICAM with a mesh size of 200 m globally to open an era of global large-eddy simulation. The above challenges on Fugaku would be harder without an effective co-design activity with the application developers. In terms of post-processing, we recently modified our MPI-based remapping tool and confirm its applicability to a global 870 m mesh data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75467' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk770' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(770)' class='star'><span class='star770'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM (E102)</b> Chris Maynard, Can Software Be Portable, Performant and Productive?

They can deliver substantial value for society utilising their predictive power. However, It can take a decade or more to develop a new model. Moreover, computer architectures and the programming models used to develop the software have evolved on a much shorter timescale and become more complex. In this presentation the Domain Specific Language (DSL) approach being adopted by the Met Office in developing its next generation model, LFRic, will be discussed and how different programming models for different architectures can then be employed without having to re-write the science code will be presented.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75467' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk771' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(771)' class='star'><span class='star771'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM (E102)</b> Kamal Sharma, Numerical Simulation of an Idealized Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Climate Model <span id='bitlink-717'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(717)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-717' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(717)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Numerical Simulation of an Idealized Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Climate Model</b><br />Kamal Sharma<br />Friday, March 3 10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-168.html'>Advances in High Performance Computing for Earth Science - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>We present numerical simulations for an idealized coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model. Our climate model belongs to the class of intermediate coupled models which are much simpler than the coupled general circulation models of the ocean-atmosphere system but still allow to study the fundamental aspects of ocean-atmosphere interactions. Our model couples an atmosphere system, described by the compressible two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations and an advection-diffusion equation for temperature, to an ocean system, given by 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and an advection-diffusion equation for temperature. Finite element method is used to discretize the system of partial differential equations representing the climate model on a 2D periodic domain and the discrete model is solved using Firedrake, which is an efficient automated finite element method library. The accuracy of simulation results of the climate model is ensured by carrying out detailed numerical investigation of its atmosphere and ocean components separately and then testing our codes against some benchmark problems available in the literature. Our final goal is to incorporate stochasticity into the coupled ocean-atmosphere model following the Hasselmann's paradigm [Klaus Hasselmann, Stochastic climate models part I. Theory, 1976] and use the model to study key features of climate phenomena like El-Nino Southern Oscillation. This will be the subject of our future work.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75467' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

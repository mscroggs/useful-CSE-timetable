Efficient boundary element method (BEM) solvers, such as the fast multipole method (FMM) and H-matrix based methods, focus on structured low-rank approximations of subblocks in these systems. The ranks of these subblocks increase linearly with the wavenumber. Recently, in [S. Dirckx, D. Huybrechs & K. Meerbergen, &#8220;Frequency extraction for BEM-matrices arising from the 3D scalar Helmholtz equation", (to appear in SISC)], we explored a data compact representation of the wavenumber dependence of these BEM matrices, based on a technique called `frequency extraction'. This allows for the efficient, quadrature-free construction of all relevant BEM-matrices in a pre-selected wavenumber range. Now we explore preconditioning techniques and efficient frequency sweeps. The preconditioning is two-fold. Firstly, we can generate so-called `operator preconditioners' quadrature-free from our data-compact representation, resulting in mesh-independent condition numbers of the BEM-systems. Secondly, Krylov subspace recycling is used to accelerate convergence of iterative solvers (e.g. GMRES), by collecting strategically chosen deflation subspaces. Our data-compact representation is augmented by these deflation spaces, and can then be used to accelerate solves at arbitrary wavenumbers in the selected range.

We demonstrate the accuracy of our method for quadratic basis functions and quadratic triangles with several numerical experiments, including the scattering by two half-spheres.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75805' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1664' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1664)' class='star'><span class='star1664'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G111)</b> Ignacia Fierro Piccardo, An OSRC Preconditioner for the EFIE <span id='bitlink-1527'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1527)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1527' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1527)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An OSRC Preconditioner for the EFIE</b><br />Ignacia Fierro Piccardo<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-368.html'>Boundary Integral Equations, Boundary Element Methods, and Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>The Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) is a well-established tool to solve scattering problems, but the development of efficient and easy to implement preconditioners for this equation remains an active research area. In recent years, operator preconditioning approaches for the EFIE, where the electric field operator is regularised by multiplication with another convenient operator, have become popular. A particular operator that is likely to be considered as a preconditioner is the exact Magnetic-to-Electric (MtE) operator. However, evaluating this operator is as expensive as solving the original EFIE.     
In [El Bouajaji, M., Antoine, X., & Geuzaine, C. Approximate local magnetic-to-electric surface operators for time-harmonic Maxwell's equations. Journal of Computational Physics], approximate local Magnetic-to-Electric surface operators for the time-harmonic Maxwell equation were proposed that can be efficiently evaluated through the solution of sparse surface problems. In [Fierro-Piccardo, I., & Betcke, T.  An OSRC Preconditioner for the EFIE] and this presentation we show the preconditioning properties of the approximate MtE operator for the EFIE. We describe the implementation and present a number of numerical comparisons against other preconditioning techniques for the EFIE to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75805' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1665' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1665)' class='star'><span class='star1665'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G111)</b> Hai Zhu, A High-Order Close Evaluation Scheme of Stokes Layer Potentials in 3D <span id='bitlink-1528'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1528)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1528' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1528)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A High-Order Close Evaluation Scheme of Stokes Layer Potentials in 3D</b><br />Hai Zhu<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-368.html'>Boundary Integral Equations, Boundary Element Methods, and Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>The close evaluation problem arises when using boundary integral methods to simulate dense suspensions of particles in Stokes flow. In this talk, we present a high-order evaluation scheme of Stokes layer potentials to handle arbitrary geometries in three dimensions, which is crucial to model the hydrodynamic interactions and detailed flow structure. The scheme relies on expressing Stokes layer potentials in terms of Laplace potentials and a recently introduced differential geometry approach to convert nearly singular surface integral into several line integrals. We then demonstrate the application of this method through several numerical examples.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75805' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1666' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1666)' class='star'><span class='star1666'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (G111)</b> David Krantz, Accurate Numerical Quadrature for 2D Stokes Flow Quantities in a Boundary Integral Equation Framework <span id='bitlink-1529'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1529)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1529' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1529)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Accurate Numerical Quadrature for 2D Stokes Flow Quantities in a Boundary Integral Equation Framework</b><br />David Krantz<br />Thursday, March 2 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-368.html'>Boundary Integral Equations, Boundary Element Methods, and Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>Highly accurate quadrature schemes for computing the velocity, pressure, stress, vorticity, pressure gradient, velocity gradient and their averages, of a 2D Stokes flow are presented. There are many benefits of using a boundary integral method such as this one to numerically solve Stokes equations. An advantage is that the dimensionality is reduced by one as the partial differential equation is rewritten into a boundary integral equation that must only be solved over the boundary of the domain in order to determine a so-called layer density. As a post-processing step, different quantities of the flow can be found via integrals of the layer density, which become difficult to accurately compute when evaluated at or close to the boundary of the domain due to the Green’s function in the integrand. Periodic problems are also considered, where so-called Ewald decompositions of the aforementioned quantities are derived to allow for rapid evaluation of the arising sums using FFTs.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75805' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

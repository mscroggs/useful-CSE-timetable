<h2>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk906' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(906)' class='star'><span class='star906'>&star;</span></a> <b>1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM (D406)</b> Ullika Scholz, Moment Model Cascades for Non-Hydrostatic Shallow Flow <span id='bitlink-834'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(834)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-834' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(834)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Moment Model Cascades for Non-Hydrostatic Shallow Flow</b><br />Ullika Scholz<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-199.html'>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>We will discuss some recent results regarding a hierarchy of nonhydrostatic moment equations for shallow flow. These include energy balances and numerical solutions for instationary flow.    
Shallow flow models are of high practical relevance, however, in certain situations they reach their limits. Due to an averaging process, information on the vertical profile of the flow variables is generally lost. This paper presents a framework for the systematic derivation of dimensionally reduced dispersive equation systems that hold information on the vertical profiles of the flow variables. The derivation from a set of balance laws is based on a splitting of the pressure followed by a same-degree polynomial expansion of the velocity and pressure fields in vertical direction. Dimensional reduction is done via Galerkin projections with weak enforcement of the boundary conditions at the bottom and at the free surface. The resulting equation systems of order zero and one are presented in linear and nonlinear form for Legendre basis functions and an analysis of dispersive properties is given. A numerical experiment shows convergence towards the resolved reference model in the linear stationary case and demonstrates the reconstruction of vertical profiles.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75509' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk907' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(907)' class='star'><span class='star907'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (D406)</b> Ingo Steldermann, Transient Velocity Profiles in Complex Shallow Flow <span id='bitlink-835'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(835)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-835' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(835)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Transient Velocity Profiles in Complex Shallow Flow</b><br />Ingo Steldermann<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-199.html'>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>Shallow water models are successfully used for simulating geophysical flows like river floods, tsunamis, sediment transport, or debris flows. One important characteristic in all these applications is the underlying material closure, e.g. a Newtonian fluid for water. In order to model more complex fluids like snow or debris as granular material, different closure relations are required. The $\mu(I)$-rheology is one such closure for granular flow that has already been applied successfully in depth-averaged models.    
An extension of classical shallow water models, which typically require a constant or predefined vertical velocity profile, is introduced in the shallow moment method. This method retains transient information about the vertical flow profile using a finite Legendre expansion to resolve the vertical velocity with time-dependent coefficients. The shallow moment approach allows to include more information systematically and generates a hierarchy of models that in the limit, recover the reference equations before depth-averaging and are therefore vertically fully resolved.  However, even a low number of basis functions significantly increases the predictive power of the model compared to classical shallow water systems.    
The shallow moment method has mostly been studied for Newtonian fluids. Therefore, this talk will focus on current developments and challenges in modeling complex fluids within the shallow moment framework.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75509' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk908' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(908)' class='star'><span class='star908'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (D406)</b> Rik Verbiest, Two-Dimensional Hyperbolic Shallow Water Moment Equations <span id='bitlink-836'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(836)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-836' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(836)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Two-Dimensional Hyperbolic Shallow Water Moment Equations</b><br />Rik Verbiest<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-199.html'>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>The recently derived Shallow Water Moment Equations (SWME) are an extension of the Shallow Water Equations and allow for vertical changes in the horizontal velocity. This results in a system that is more accurate in situations where the horizontal velocity varies considerably over the height of the fluid. Unfortunately, these models lack global hyperbolicity. This has previously been observed for the 1D SWME and we show that the loss of hyperbolicity also occurs in the 2D systems. We derive 2D Hyperbolic Shallow Water Moment Equations (HSWME) by modifying the system matrix.     
After the derivation of the 2D equations, an equilibrium stability analysis of the new system is performed. Equilibrium manifolds are derived and structural stability conditions are checked for these manifolds. The analysis is a direct extension of the work done on the one-dimensional equations. We show that the 2D HSWME contain stable and unstable equilibrium states.     
Next, a formulation of the SWME in cylindrical coordinates is presented. The model is useful in situations where cylindrical coordinates are more appropriate, e.g., when the application exhibits circular symmetry, as is the case in the modelling of a tsunami, for example. Finally, a hyperbolic system for axisymmetric flow is derived.

Seen within a wide range of astrophysical, geophysical, and engineering applications, such divergence-free constraints are physically and analytically exact. On a discrete level, however, an improper treatment of an identically-zero divergence may lead to large instabilities in solutions – even when applying methods that already successfully simulate fluids without this constraint. Thus, a careful algorithmic construction is required to ensure these constraints are exactly preserved within numerical approximations. In this talk, we restrict our attention to an important sub-class of divergence-free systems – the magnetohydrodynamic equations, keeping in mind that the developed method can be extended to other models constrained by zero-divergence. We present a new method that exactly preserves the divergence-free condition of the magnetohydrodynamic system on an unstaggered mesh. The designed method has been successfully tested on several examples.

Due to the rampant epidemic of this pandemic, there have been many evident cases of other lung infections that are a threat to human life misdiagnosed as COVID-19 infection. Hence, an efficient system that distinguishes lungs affected by COVID-19 and other infections is highly essential for clinicians in these times. Therefore, a transfer learning-based convolution neural network (CNN) is designed for accurate detection that classifies as covid-19 affected, abnormal and healthy from computed tomography slices. Competitive results of different CNN architectures namely, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet and Inception v3 networks are compared. Related works in the literature include [Sahinbas, K. and Catak, F.O., 2021.

The molecular trajectory is obtained from Markov state models, and the electrostatic potential is calculated using the continuum Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The numerical electric potential is constructed using a parallel sharp numerical solver implemented on adaptive Octree grids. We introduce novel a posteriori error estimates to quantify the solution's accuracy on the molecular surface. To illustrate the approach, we consider the opening of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the recent molecular trajectory simulated through the Folding@home initiative. We analyze our results, focusing on the characteristics of the receptor-binding domain and its vicinity. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid computational approaches, producing high-fidelity dynamical computational measurements serving as a basis for protein bio-mechanism investigations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77154' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1980' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1980)' class='star'><span class='star1980'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (G101)</b> Hamisu Idi, Dynamic Models of the Infection of Lassa Fever Epidemics Incorporating Detected and Undetected Class <span id='bitlink-1815'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1815)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1815' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1815)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Dynamic Models of the Infection of Lassa Fever Epidemics Incorporating Detected and Undetected Class</b><br />Hamisu Idi<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-408.html'>Using CSE to Understand COVID and Other Infectious Diseases</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>In this study, a dynamical model of the infection of Lassa fever which incorporates detected and undetected classes was proposed to investigate the effect of vaccine on the spread of the Lassa disease. The stability analysis of the model was conducted to determine free and endemic equilibrium. The exact solutions of the models were obtained using analytic technique. The basic reproduction number was determined using the next generation matrix approach. The local and global stability were carried out using Routh-Hurwitz conditions and the Castillo-chavez criterion. The numerical computations of the exact solutions were also done using Mathematica software. The result obtained shows that, the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction   otherwise itâ€™s unstable. These indicate that, the Lassa fever disease will be completely wiped out if the secondary infection is kept below unity.

A unique positive solution for the proposed model with the positive initial conditions is obtained. The stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium have been investigated. It has been proved that the DFE is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0\leq1$. The proposed model has a unique endemic equilibrium that is globally asymptotically stable whenever $\mathcal{R}_0>1$. The theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical simulation.    	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77154' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

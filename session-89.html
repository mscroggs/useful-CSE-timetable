This situation ultimately poses a threat for coastal regions affected by sea-level rise or in valley-glaciers subject to surges and collapses of ice masses. Numerical modelling permits to understand and predict the evolution of these complex natural systems resolving the underlying physical processes in three dimensions. Moreover, high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial to capture rapid changes in the system leading to the formation of, e.g., ice streams or collapse features. We here present innovative software tools which provide a way forward in ice dynamics and computational Earth sciences by exploiting massively parallel supercomputing on graphics processing units (GPUs) and scalable iterative solvers. We use Julia language because it features high-level capabilities without compromising high performance and portability amongst multiple backends (e.g., multi-core CPUs, and NVIDIA and AMD GPUs). We will compare different Julia multi-GPU full-Stokes solvers for ice flow with thermo-mechanical coupling and discuss the performance of various discretisation and boundary conditions approaches as well as compare the efficiency of the solvers.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75353' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk399' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(399)' class='star'><span class='star399'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (E104)</b> Jerry Watkins, Performance Portable Extensions to Ice-Sheet Modeling in Mali <span id='bitlink-369'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(369)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-369' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(369)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Performance Portable Extensions to Ice-Sheet Modeling in Mali</b><br />Jerry Watkins<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-89.html'>Advanced Computational Methods for Ice-Sheet Modeling and Analysis - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>The road to exascale computing has introduced a need to redesign our scientific software for new computing architectures that require a fundamentally different programming model. In an effort to avoid architecture specific programming and maintain productivity across platforms, the ice-sheet modeling code known as MALI uses high level abstractions to integrate Trilinos libraries and the Kokkos programming model for performance portable code across a variety of different architectures. By utilizing packages within Trilinos and the Kokkos programming model, a significant amount of progress has been made towards developing a framework that supports high resolution simulations of ice sheets on pre-exascale systems and beyond. This presentation focuses on the key performance developments and future performance goals of developing and maintaining a modern, robust and scalable land ice solver.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75353' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk400' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(400)' class='star'><span class='star400'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (E104)</b> Kim Liegeois, Computational Efficient Estimation of the Extreme Event Probability of the Mass Loss of Antarctic Ice Sheets <span id='bitlink-370'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(370)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-370' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(370)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Computational Efficient Estimation of the Extreme Event Probability of the Mass Loss of Antarctic Ice Sheets</b><br />Kim Liegeois<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-89.html'>Advanced Computational Methods for Ice-Sheet Modeling and Analysis - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>The mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheets is one of the major causes of the sea level rise.   Future projections of sea level rise have a large variability due to uncertainties in the climate models and socioeconomics factors, and it is important to study low-probability but high-risk scenarios.  Standard Monte Carlo methods may require an infeasible large number of expensive forward simulations to obtain useful estimate of extreme events probability.  In this presentation, we explore forward uncertainty quantification methods that rely on optimization strategies to estimate these probabilities.  The proposed UQ methods build on ideas from PDE-constrained optimization and the probability estimation of tail probabilities.  We illustrate that this approach is computationally more efficient than using standard Monte Carlo methods with larger number of expensive forward simulations when estimating the probability of extreme mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheets.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75353' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk401' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(401)' class='star'><span class='star401'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (E104)</b> Tucker Hartland, Exploiting Hierarchical Low-Rank Structure in Ice Sheet Inverse Problems <span id='bitlink-371'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(371)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-371' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(371)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Exploiting Hierarchical Low-Rank Structure in Ice Sheet Inverse Problems</b><br />Tucker Hartland<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-89.html'>Advanced Computational Methods for Ice-Sheet Modeling and Analysis - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we discuss the problem of estimating solutions of large-scale inverse problems governed by partial differential equation (PDE) based models and the associated uncertainties. The ice flow is modeled as a  three-dimensional, viscous, incompressible fluid via the nonlinear  (first-order) Stokes equations. Solving inverse problems with expensive forward models and high-dimensional parameters is computationally challenging. Here, we exploit the local sensitivity of model predictions to parameters which suggests that the Hessian has off-diagonal low-rank structure, and so therefore build hierarchical matrix Hessian approximations. We demonstrate that for problems with sufficiently-informative data, hierarchical matrices provide for a more computationally efficient approximation format than the related global low-rank format.   This motivates the use of hierarchical matrices for continental-scale problems. Presented computational results are generated using PyAlbany,  a Python interface to the C++ multiphysics library Albany.    
Time permitting, we outline a framework that utilizes Hessian impulse responses of the Hessian and a physically motivated impulse response  interpolation scheme, to further reduce the computational cost of  generating hierarhical matrix Hessian approximations. Said framework is employed to generate inexact Newton-CG preconditioners, which ultimately reduce the number of PDE solves needed to estimate the  inverse problem solution.

Here, we use a Bayesian approach, to quantify the degree to which observational uncertainty translates to parametric uncertainty (posterior uncertainty of inversions for basal drag and ice stiffness fields) and to uncertainty in projected quantities of interest (QoIs) such as sea level contribution. Our framework implements the Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA), and a control methods approach to invert for the basal drag and ice stiffness fields. Beginning with a cost function optimization which can allow for either gridded or point-cloud velocities, we generate a low-rank approximation to the posterior covariance of the parameters via the use of the cost function Hessian. In our work, the Hessian is calculated through algorithmic differentiation (AD) using the &#8220;complete” Hessian rather than the Gauss–Newton approximation. We then project the covariance on a linearization of the time-dependent ice sheet model to estimate the growth of the QoI uncertainty over time. We apply for the first time this framework to real ice streams in the Amundsen basin, and present several model experiments exploring the impact on uncertainty due to different strengths of priors, sliding laws and velocity inputs. We explore the model capabilities when we applied it to these ice streams and lay out our plans to scale our framework into a larger domain.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75353' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

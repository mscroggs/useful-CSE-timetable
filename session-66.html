Specifically, we show that the concept of spectral submanifolds (SSMs) provides very low-dimensional attractors in a large family of physical problems that range from wing oscillations to transitions in shear flows. A data-driven identification of the reduced dynamics on these SSMs gives a rigorous way to construct accurate and predictive reduced-order models in applications without the use of governing equations. We illustrate this on problems that include accelerated finite-element simulations of large structures, prediction of transitions in plane Couette flow, reduced-order modeling of fluid sloshing in a tank, and model-predictive control of soft robots.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75309' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk300' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(300)' class='star'><span class='star300'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (G107)</b> Francesco Romor, Non-Linear Manifold Rom with Convolutional Autoencoders and Reduced Over-Collocation Method <span id='bitlink-277'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(277)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-277' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(277)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Non-Linear Manifold Rom with Convolutional Autoencoders and Reduced Over-Collocation Method</b><br />Francesco Romor<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-66.html'>Nonlinear Approximations of Latent Dynamics for Model Reduction and Beyond - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Non-affine parametric dependencies, nonlinearities, and advection-dominated regimes of the model of interest can result in a slow Kolmogorov n-width decay, which precludes the realization of efficient reduced-order models based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Among the possible solutions, there are purely data-driven methods that leverage nonlinear approximation techniques such as autoencoders and their variants to learn a latent representation of the dynamical system, and then evolve it in time with another architecture. Despite their success in many applications where standard linear techniques fail, more has to be done to increase the interpretability of the results, especially outside the training range and not in regimes characterized by an abundance of data. Not to mention that none of the knowledge on the physics of the model is exploited during the predictive phase. In this talk, in order to overcome these weaknesses, we implement a variant of the nonlinear manifold method introduced in previous works with hyper-reduction achieved through reduced over-collocation and teacher-student training of a reduced decoder. We test the methodology on a 2d nonlinear conservation law model and compare the results we would obtain with a purely data-driven method for which the dynamics is evolved in time with a long-short term memory network.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75309' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk301' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(301)' class='star'><span class='star301'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G107)</b> Tobias Blickhan, Tackling Advection-Dominated Problems Using Linear Optimal Transport <span id='bitlink-278'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(278)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-278' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(278)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tackling Advection-Dominated Problems Using Linear Optimal Transport</b><br />Tobias Blickhan<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-66.html'>Nonlinear Approximations of Latent Dynamics for Model Reduction and Beyond - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>In model reduction of parametrized partial differential equations, Reduced Basis Methods are well-established for the calculation of solutions in low-dimensional linear spaces. However, advection-dominated problems are difficult to tackle this way.   In their work Nonlinear model reduction on metric spaces, Ehrlacher et al. (2020) consider PDE solutions as elements of the $L^2$-Wasserstein space. Distributions are expressed as weighted means (in the sense of the Wasserstein distance) of a select few reference elements.   Using Linear Optimal Transportation (also known as Monge Embeddings), we extend this approach to more than one spatial dimension. In LOT, a distribution $\mu$ is mapped to the optimal transport map $T_{\sigma \rightarrow \mu}$ that takes a fixed reference distribution $\sigma$ to $\mu$. While the set of solutions $\{ \mu_i \}_{i=1,2,\dots}$ typically exhibits slow n-width decay, that of the set of maps $\{ T_{\sigma \rightarrow \mu_i} \}_{i=1,2,\dots}$ is much faster. This allows us to find a low-dimensional approximation of transport maps, which are elements of a linear space.   Since reconstruction of a solution via these reduced maps is not exact, we can improve the approximation by using a reduced basis in the reference domain. This leads to a method in the spirit of snapshot remapping that is illustrated with numerical examples.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75309' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk302' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(302)' class='star'><span class='star302'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G107)</b> Philipp Schulze, Structure-Preserving Model Reduction for Transport-Dominated Port-Hamiltonian Systems <span id='bitlink-279'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(279)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-279' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(279)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structure-Preserving Model Reduction for Transport-Dominated Port-Hamiltonian Systems</b><br />Philipp Schulze<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-66.html'>Nonlinear Approximations of Latent Dynamics for Model Reduction and Beyond - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>The framework of port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems provides a generalization of classical Hamiltonian systems which allows to describe internal energy dissipation as well as energy exchange with the environment. This system class comes with many desirable properties such as passivity and often also stability. Here, passivity refers, roughly speaking, to the inability of the system to internally generate energy out of nowhere. As a consequence, the pH framework may be used in the field of model reduction to ensure that the reduced-order models (ROMs) are stable and passive by employing structure-preserving methods.    
In this talk, we present a structure-preserving model reduction technique for port-Hamiltonian systems based on a recently proposed nonlinear model reduction approach. Especially, we consider a special nonlinear approximation ansatz where the state of the full-order model is approximated by a linear combination of transformed modes. These transformations may be for instance achieved by suitable translation or shift operators and allow to obtain low-dimensional and accurate approximations of transport-dominated systems. In order to achieve structure preservation, we demonstrate that the ROMs may be constructed by minimizing the residual in a suitably weighted norm. In this context, we also discuss stability of the resulting ROMs. Finally, the new approach is illustrated by means of a numerical test case.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75309' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk303' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(303)' class='star'><span class='star303'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (G107)</b> Sridhar Chellappa, Machine Learning Enhanced a Posteriori Error Estimation for Model Reduction of Nonlinear Parametric Systems <span id='bitlink-280'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(280)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-280' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(280)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Machine Learning Enhanced a Posteriori Error Estimation for Model Reduction of Nonlinear Parametric Systems</b><br />Sridhar Chellappa<br />Tuesday, February 28 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-66.html'>Nonlinear Approximations of Latent Dynamics for Model Reduction and Beyond - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>In this work, we are interested in obtaining parametric reduced-order models (pROMs) for parametric nonlinear dynamical systems using snapshot-based model order reduction techniques. Residual-based a posteriori error estimators for pROMs are usually derived based on a given and known time discretization scheme for the spatially discretized full-order model. However, for many cases (such as stiff systems), the time integration is often performed using black-box solvers (such as ode45 in MATLAB, lsode in Octave, etc.) that use automatic order and step-size control. Such systems pose a challenge for residual-based error estimation of their pROMs since the exact form of the time integration is unknown. To address this, we use machine learning to learn the mismatch between the true value of the residual and the one obtained by imposing a chosen time discretization scheme. Our approach aims at deriving a sharp a posteriori output error estimator for such cases. Using examples from process engineering (batch chromatography) and fluid dynamics (Burgers' equation), we show that our proposed approach is able to more accurately characterize the true output errors of pROMs for systems solved by black-box time integration solvers.	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75309' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

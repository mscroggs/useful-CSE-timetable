In the case of conservation laws, these schemes often employ non-standard  flux formulations which can entail intrusive coding modifications. Alternatively, Abgrall  introduces a procedure for satisfying additional conservation relations such as entropy  [R. Abgrall, J. Comput. Phys, 2018]; the approach utilizes a telescoping correction term that is agnostic to the baseline  method.  Abgrall's correction term is composed of first and second moment statistics (i.e., the  mean and variance) of the relevant transformation variables (e.g., entropy variables). A  generalization of the methodology is thus made possible by relating averaging to  filtering. Therefore, the current work re-interprets Abgrall's correction procedure as  specialized filter-based artificial dissipation methods [A. K. Edoh, J. Comput. Phys, 2018]. We consider finite difference  discretizations within the SBP-SAT framework and study the impacts of filter choice  (e.g., filter order, stencil localization, wavenumber attenuation) on the overall  performance of the approach.

The unconditional SSP property for a method of order p>2 is unique among SSP methods, and depends on a backward-in-time assumption on the derivative of the operator. We show that this backward derivative condition is satisfied in many relevant cases where SSP IMEX schemes are desired. We devise unconditionally SSP implicit Runge-Kutta schemes of order up to p=4, and IMEX Runge-Kutta schemes of order up to p=3. For the multi-derivative IMEX schemes, we also derive and present the order conditions, which have not appeared previously. The unconditional SSP condition ensures that these methods are positivity preserving, and we present sufficient conditions under which such methods are also asymptotic preserving when applied to a range of problems, including a hyperbolic relaxation system, the Broadwell model, and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) kinetic equation. We present numerical results to support the theoretical results, on a variety of problems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75640' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1290' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1290)' class='star'><span class='star1290'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (E101)</b> Ben Simpson, Entropy-Stable Positivity Preserving Schemes for Multiphase Flows <span id='bitlink-1191'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1191)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1191' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1191)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Entropy-Stable Positivity Preserving Schemes for Multiphase Flows</b><br />Ben Simpson<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-284.html'>Numerical Filtering and Property Preserving Methods - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>The multiphase description of flow phenomena is an attractive option for modelling complex flows as all fluids in the domain can be modelled using a single set of governing equations as opposed to separate sets of equations for each phase. The current work is aimed at studying the problem of an acoustically generated bubble collapse using high accuracy simulations. Typically, high-order methods have stability issues, especially when considering complex physics. However, in the last decade, there has been considerable progress made in developing provably nonlinearly stable schemes for conservative problems by combining summation-by-parts (SBP) operators and symmetric two-point flux functions. The goal of this work is to develop provably-stable high-order schemes for multiphase flows in non conservative form. To achieve this goal, the framework of Renac is leveraged to develop an entropy-stable SBP scheme using a non-symmetric two-point flux function. However, quantities such as density and void fractions of each phase require positivity to be preserved. To this end,   the work of Upperman and Yamaleev is utilised to determine the appropriate time step to take to preserve positivity of these quantities. In this presentation, the details of the resulting schemes and numerical tests on smooth flows are presented.

Rigorous spatial coupling between components in such systems involves field transformations, and communication of data across multiresolution grids, while preserving key attributes of interest such as global integrals and local features, which is usually referred to as the process of "remapping". Such remap procedures are critical in ensuring stability and accuracy of scientific codes simulating multiphysics problems that typically occur in many different scientific domains such as Fluid-Structure interaction, nuclear reactor analysis, magneto-hydrodynamics modeling, and Climate and Weather simulations to name a few.     
Improper treatment of the coupled solution terms in multiphysics simulations can lead to large inaccuracies that can propagate and destroy the overall accuracy and stability of the numerical computation.  Since solution transfer between different discretizations of the domain plays a critical role here, we introduce an infrastructure based on the MOAB unstructured mesh library to handle field projections to recover high-order accuracy in a scalable way, while preserving key remapping metrics of interest for various applications.

They rely on the confinement of a hot plasma in a topologically toroidal vessel by using magnetic fields that are entirely generated externally. Since the charged particles in the plasma tend to follow magnetic field lines, a magnetic field that foliates nested surfaces is desirable. These magnetic surfaces can act as heat and particle transport barriers and in particular this is guaranteed if certain symmetries are ensured. The presence of the plasma, however, implies the existence of electric currents inside the confinement volume that scale with the plasma pressure. These currents perturb the magnetic field and, beyond a certain pressure limit, can break the magnetic surfaces. The breaking of the surfaces, which often leads to magnetic field line chaos, allows magnetic field lines to undergo large excursions across the device, which can be detrimental for confinement. In this talk I will show how these pressure limits can be predicted and how they can be increased by optimizing the external magnetic field or by externally perturbing the plasma current. This involves solving the magneto-hydrodynamic equilibrium problem in three dimensions, a fantastic numerical challenge that requires treating magnetic field discontinuities as well as chaotic magnetic field lines.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75545' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1019' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1019)' class='star'><span class='star1019'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (Auditorium)</b> Benjamin Faber, Multi-Objective Non-Convex Stellarator Optimization in Julia <span id='bitlink-938'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(938)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-938' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(938)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multi-Objective Non-Convex Stellarator Optimization in Julia</b><br />Benjamin Faber<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-223.html'>Computational Challenges in Fusion Plasma Confinement</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Designing new stellarator configurations with improved plasma confinement presents a challenging numerical optimization problem.  A characteristic feature of stellarator optimization is the need to optimize for different competing physics objectives that span a range of disparate time and length scales. Further complicating matters, the standard method for computing stellarator equilibria by specifying the plasma boundary is an ill-posed problem. When combined, these properties produce a complex optimization landscape that is both non-convex and not simply connected.   A final barrier to stellarator optimization traditionally has been in the numerical software itself. In general, the existing software for stellarator optimization is very heterogenous in complexity/resource requirements and implementation language, presenting a large barrier to leveraging new developments in both optimization techniques and physics objective models. To address these needs, a new suite of modular optimization packages has been created using Julia that provides a common framework for interfacing equilibrium solvers and physics objectives with robust optimization routines. Built with high-performance computing and usability in mind, new physics objective functions can be seamlessly incorporated into optimizations that performantly scale to thousands of CPUs. This framework has been employed to optimize for turbulent transport simultaneously with good fast particle confinement and quasisymmetry.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75545' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1020' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1020)' class='star'><span class='star1020'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (Auditorium)</b> Maximilian Ruth, Level Set Learning for Poincar&#233; Plots of Symplectic Maps <span id='bitlink-939'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(939)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-939' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(939)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Level Set Learning for Poincar&#233; Plots of Symplectic Maps</b><br />Maximilian Ruth<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-223.html'>Computational Challenges in Fusion Plasma Confinement</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Many important qualities of plasma confinement devices can be determined via a Poincaré plot of the symplectic magnetic field return map. These qualities include the locations of chaotic regions of phase space and the locations of magnetic islands, which are commonly used for ejecting unwanted particles in the plasma. However, every evaluation of the magnetic return map requires an ODE solve, meaning a detailed Poincaré plot can be expensive to create. In recent years, a variety of symplecticity-preserving neural network based learning methods have been proposed that could be used as proxies to speed up return map evaluations. Unfortunately, these methods still require long training times, and are too expensive to be used for stellarator optimization objectives. In this talk, we propose a kernel-based method where we instead learn a single labeling function that is approximately invariant under the symplectic map. From the labeling function, we show that we can recover important qualities of the Poincaré plot, including the location of stable orbits, islands and chaos. Additionally, the labeling function can be found with relatively few evaluations of the underlying symplectic map, while being robust to error in the symplectic map.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75545' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1021' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1021)' class='star'><span class='star1021'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM (Auditorium)</b> Rory Conlin, Stellarator Optimization with Automatic Differentiation in DESC <span id='bitlink-940'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(940)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-940' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(940)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stellarator Optimization with Automatic Differentiation in DESC</b><br />Rory Conlin<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-223.html'>Computational Challenges in Fusion Plasma Confinement</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Next-generation fusion reactor designs require expensive numerical optimization to ensure good confinement and achievable engineering tolerances. DESC is a newly developed code that computes 3D Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performs PDE constrained optimization of these solutions. DESC solves for equilibria by solving the force balance equation $J \times B = \nabla p$ using a pseudo-spectral method. In tests, it has been shown to be significantly more accurate than legacy codes such as VMEC, particularly near the coordinate singularity at the magnetic axis. DESC is also the first 3D MHD equilibrium code built with automatic differentiation, which allows accurate calculation of the Jacobian matrices at negligible additional cost. These derivatives can then be used for optimizing the solutions to obtain desirable physics and engineering properties. This reduces the computation time by three orders of magnitude in tests compared to the legacy code STELLOPT, and enables exploration over a higher-dimensional parameter space. Examples such as quasisymmetry, metrics for particle confinement, stability, and turbulent fluxes will be shown. DESC also allows novel boundary conditions, which yields understanding on the existence of non-axisymmetric equilibria with nested flux surfaces and reveals their connection to axisymmetric solutions. Examples of these computational advances are demonstrated along with a discussion of the new physics insights they provide.

Understanding the growth and properties of hydrodynamic instabilities and the transition into turbulence is important in many HED processes and also yields insights into other areas where hydrodynamic instabilities occur. In contrast to classical fluids experiments, examining hydrodynamic instabilities in the HED regime poses novel challenges. HED experiments are expensive and often performed at oversubscribed facilities. Additionally, there are many limitations for the available diagnostics and experiments are typically multi-physics in nature. Such complexity means that modeling can become prohibitively expensive. Improving the models from limited experimental and high-fidelity simulation data is therefore of great importance. We will discuss the use of statistical techniques on a large suite of 2D xRAGE simulations of multimode Richtmyer-Meshkov and Rayleigh-Taylor experiments performed on Omega-EP to better understand turbulence in the HED regime. We will preform Bayesian inference to quantify and reduce uncertainty on our model parameters using experimental data. We will also explore experimental design techniques to identify the most informative experiments. These computations will involve many repeated forward model runs, which can be enabled through building inexpensive surrogate models that approximate the high-fidelity XRAGE.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75545' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

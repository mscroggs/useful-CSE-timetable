Bader<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-7.html'>Scaling Data Science, AI, and, ML on Massively Multi-Threaded Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Due to the emergence of massive real-world graphs, whose sizes may extend to terabytes, new tools must be developed to enable data scientists to handle such graphs efficiently. These graphs may include social networks, computer networks, and genomes. In this talk, we present our novel graph package, Arachne, to make large-scale graph analytics more effortless and efficient based on the open-source Arkouda framework. Arkouda has been developed to allow users to perform massively parallel computations on distributed data with an interface similar to NumPy. In this package, we developed a fundamental sparse graph data structure and then built several useful graph algorithms around our data structure to form a basic algorithmic library. Benchmarks and tools were also developed to evaluate and demonstrate the use of our graph algorithms. The graph algorithms we have implemented thus far include breadth-first search (BFS), connected components (CC), k-Truss (KT), Jaccard coefficients (JC), triangle counting (TC), and triangle centrality (TCE). Their corresponding experimental results based on realworld and synthetic graphs are presented. Arachne is organized as an Arkouda extension package and is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75193' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk30' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(30)' class='star'><span class='star30'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM (D504)</b> Vijay Thakkar, Writing Custom GPU Linear Algebra Kernels for Fun and Peak Performance <span id='bitlink-30'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(30)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-30' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(30)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Writing Custom GPU Linear Algebra Kernels for Fun and Peak Performance</b><br />Vijay Thakkar<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-7.html'>Scaling Data Science, AI, and, ML on Massively Multi-Threaded Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>GPU programs that achieve peak performance are notoriously difficult to write, as they require the author to not only reason about concurrent execution, but also have an appreciable understanding of the underlying microarchitecture. Although vendor libraries provide basic kernels such as the BLAS suite, with modern workloads, it is becoming increasingly critical to accelerate their custom computations that have been codesign with the application algorithm in mind and are less likely to be supported by vendors out of the box due to their bespoke nature. In this talk, we motivate the need for custom GPU linear algebra kernels by taking our efforts to run all pairs shortest path on Summit and Frontier supercomputers as a case study, and highlight the features of our library, CUDA Algebra for Semirings (cuASR) that emerged from it. Highlighting this as a user story, we go over how it influences the design philosophy for open source vendor libraries that are expected to be extended by users, and we conclude with the new features in NVIDIA CUTLASS and how one can extend its abstractions to author custom kernels that achieve peak performance on modern CUDA hardware.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75193' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk31' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(31)' class='star'><span class='star31'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM (D504)</b> Sanil Rao, GBTLX: High Performance Code Generation of Graph Applications <span id='bitlink-31'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(31)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-31' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(31)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>GBTLX: High Performance Code Generation of Graph Applications</b><br />Sanil Rao<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-7.html'>Scaling Data Science, AI, and, ML on Massively Multi-Threaded Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>We propose GBTLX, a code generation framework that translates a linear algebraic graph program written with a high level library into a program that would be written by a domain expert. In the front end, GBTLX captures the set of graph library calls within the program. This is then sent to the code generation system, SPIRAL, for semantic analysis and optimization. If a known algorithm is found, SPIRAL will generate a domain expert algorithm in place of those library calls. The code generation process is built with the same building blocks that makes linear algebraic graph processing so appealing, and uses a rule based system to transform those building blocks into known algorithms. The process also supports various graph representations and hardware architectures. The end result is a single source framework that provides domain knowledge at both the algorithmic and architectural level, while keeping a user-friendly medium, a high level library. We show that the generated code for GBTLX achieves performance comparable to others in the larger community.

Each comes with its own modeling features and disjoint query languages. At Amazon Neptune, we are developing a single, unified graph data model that embraces both RDF and LPG, that we named OneGraph (1G). We are also building a scalable computational infrastructure that will support both OLTP and OLAP workloads on 1G model. In this talk, I will present challenges of supporting HPC Graph analytics on this new computational framework.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75193' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

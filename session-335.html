Block-structured AMR specifically refines the mesh by defining locally structured regions with finer spatial, and possibly temporal, resolution. This combination of locally structured meshes within an irregular global hierarchy is in some sense the best of both worlds in that it enables regular local data access while enabling greater flexibility in the overall computation.    
Algorithms that evolve the solution on a hierarchical mesh are more complex than algorithms operating on a single uniform domain.  The nature of the complexity typically depends on the mathematical character of the governing equations and the additional physics being represented across levels.   In this talk I will give a very brief overview of the different types of block-structured AMR, different strategies for creating the mesh hierarchy, different approaches to time advancement, and some of the ways that algorithms must be adapted for use on an AMR hierarchy.

Insights into the multiscale driving mechanisms in compressible reacting flow systems with complex geometry, such as combustors, can be used for design optimization and technology improvements. However, to effectively perform these simulations, advanced numerical algorithms must be used to maintain solution accuracy without incurring undue computational costs. PeleC, part of  the Pele suite of codes, leverages block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) through the AMReX library to capture fine-scale flow features in compressible reacting flows. In this talk, we discuss recent improvements to the numerical algorithms, particularly in regard to describing flows at complex boundary structures, and PeleC’s performance on exascale computing hardware. We will demonstrate that PeleC is well-suited for modern, extreme-scale, heterogenous compute platforms.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75740' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1521' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1521)' class='star'><span class='star1521'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM (E106)</b> Andrew Kirby, Multiscale Fluid Dynamics Enabled by Adaptive Mesh Refinement in Aerospace and Wind Energy Applications <span id='bitlink-1395'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1395)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1395' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1395)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multiscale Fluid Dynamics Enabled by Adaptive Mesh Refinement in Aerospace and Wind Energy Applications</b><br />Andrew Kirby<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-335.html'>Adaptive Mesh Refinement: Algorithms and Applications - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>Many fluid dynamics problems found in aerospace and wind energy applications require multi-scale simulation capabilities to track turbulent vortical fluid structures such as the wakes generated by wind turbines or helicopter rotors. To resolve these complex multiscale phenomena, parallel adaptive mesh refinement paired with overset grid technologies provides a computationally efficient and scalable solution. We highlight the octree-based AMR approach in tandem with overset grid assembly for simulating these relative-body motion problems. Further, we leverage characteristics of octree-based AMR algorithms to accelerate the overset grid assembly process for implicit hole cutting. Lastly, we'll discuss future capabilities needed for AMR and overset to leverage next-generation heterogeneous computing systems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75740' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1522' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1522)' class='star'><span class='star1522'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM (E106)</b> Damyn M.

Direct solvers, like the Hierarchical Poincaré-Steklov (HPS) method, work by forming a factorization of the system matrix that can be applied to as many right-hand sides or time steps as needed. However, when the mesh changes, the factorization must be completely reformed. The HPS method attempts to solve this by forming a set of solution operators that are built on an adaptive, quadtree structure. The HPS method can achieve linear O(N) factorization performance in 2D and is matrix-free as it does not need to form the system matrix. It also allows for a dynamic update to the solution operators when the mesh changes, solving the so-called “near-by” problem. We present our implementation of the HPS method on quadtree meshes with the p4est software library. We will show results solving Poisson’s equation for eventual coupling with a hyperbolic solver through the ForestClaw software library. In addition, we will present our progress on a parallel implementation on distributed memory architectures.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75740' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1523' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1523)' class='star'><span class='star1523'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM (E106)</b> Abhinav Jha, Adaptive Grids for Algebraic Stabilizations of Convection-Diffusion-Reaction Equations <span id='bitlink-1397'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1397)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1397' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1397)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Grids for Algebraic Stabilizations of Convection-Diffusion-Reaction Equations</b><br />Abhinav Jha<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-335.html'>Adaptive Mesh Refinement: Algorithms and Applications - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>Non-linear discretizations are necessary for convection-diffusion-reaction equations for obtaining accurate solutions that satisfy the discrete maximum principle (DMP). Algebraic stabilizations belong to the very few finite element discretizations that satisfy this property.     
This talk considers three algebraically stabilized finite element schemes for discretizing convection-diffusion-reaction equations on adaptively refined grids. These schemes are the algebraic flux correction (AFC) scheme with Kuzmin limiter, the AFC scheme with BJK limiter, and the recently proposed Monotone Upwind-type Algebraically Stabilized (MUAS) method. Both conforming closure of the refined grids   and grids with hanging vertices are considered based on a residual-based a posteriori error estimator.    
A non-standard algorithmic step becomes necessary before these schemes can be applied on grids with hanging vertices.  The assessment of the schemes is performed with respect   to the satisfaction of the global discrete maximum principle (DMP), the accuracy, e.g., smearing of layers, and the efficiency in solving the corresponding nonlinear problems.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75740' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

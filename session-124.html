Such transformations have been used, for example, as a preprocessing step by model order reduction methods and for transforming chemical reaction networks.   We will present an extension of a recent algorithm for finding optimal quadratizations with new variables being monomials to the case of systems with inputs, and show its applications to models from the literature. We will use this to give an algorithm for quadratizing evolutionary polynomial PDEs.  The talk is based on joint works with Andrey Bychkov and Boris Kramer.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75411' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk563' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(563)' class='star'><span class='star563'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (G110)</b> Francesco Carravetta, Quadratization of Differential Equations: the Connection with Analogic and Digital Computability of Their Solutions <span id='bitlink-522'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(522)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-522' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(522)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quadratization of Differential Equations: the Connection with Analogic and Digital Computability of Their Solutions</b><br />Francesco Carravetta<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-124.html'>Exact Polynomialization and Quadratization of Nonlinear Dynamics - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>In this talk a recent method, said 'exact quadratization', of manifold immersion where the image vector field is always quadratic in the local, whatever chosen, coordinates is described, and the relevance of such kind of immersion is illustrated in problems of applied mathematics. In particular, it will be  shown that exact quadratization allows a fast calculation of the Taylor coefficients in Taylor series methods for ODE numerical integration. The problem of classify quadratizable nonlinear functions is also sketched. It will be shown that this problem is closely related with computability, and in particular that the class of quadratizable functions consists of all the functions that can be generated though analog computer, which in turn consists (for ODEs) of all differentially algebraic functions. Connections with the algebraic theory of control is highlighted as well.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75411' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk564' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(564)' class='star'><span class='star564'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G110)</b> Bruno Cochelin, Quadratisation for Periodic Solutions Continuation <span id='bitlink-523'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(523)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-523' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(523)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quadratisation for Periodic Solutions Continuation</b><br />Bruno Cochelin<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-124.html'>Exact Polynomialization and Quadratization of Nonlinear Dynamics - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>The talk will be concerned with the quadratisation process that we are using in the “in-house” software Manlab-4 devoted to the continuation of periodic solution branches of smooth ODE systems. Our numerical strategy relies on a successive use of two series expansion: a high order Fourier series for the periodic solution finding and a high order Taylor series for the continuation process (the so-called Asymptotic-numerical Method). In order to be able to easily and automatically derive the reduced equations (by collecting term with the same power), the ODE system is augmented with auxiliary variables and equations, so that each equation becomes either a quadratic one or involves only a single transcendental  function (ex: y=exp(x)).  The differentiated form of the transcendental function is also written quadratically (dy= x*dx) for use in the series computation.  The size of the augmented system may be much higher than the one of the original ODE system, but since we use a systematic condensation of the auxiliary variables each time we solve a linear system, this is not a drawback. The last implementation of this strategy makes an intensive use of sparse tensors of order one, two and three, and its computational performances allows to treat moderate size systems obtained by a finite element discretization of a continuous problem.  Various examples ranging from solid vibrations, nonlinear acoustics and fluid-structure interactions will be presented.

That problem is part of our compilation pipeline for transforming any computable real function presented by a PODE, into an elementary Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) which computes that function on a distinguished output species.    
In this talk, we are interested in a notion of online robust analog computation using stabilizing CRN/PODE, i.e. systems for which the input/output relation is solely defined by the set of stable fixed points.  This leads us to study a variant of the quadratization problem which preserves the set of stable states of the original system instead of the complete trajectories. While this problem may seem simpler than the previous one, we show its NP-hardness in the non-succinct representation with a reduction of the cover vertex set problem as previously. We report however on satisfactory practical performance results obtained with our MAXSAT implementation on a benchmark of CRN synthesis problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75411' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk566' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(566)' class='star'><span class='star566'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (G110)</b> Yukun Yue, On Convergence Analysis of a First-Order Semi-Discrete Numerical Scheme for a Hydrodynamic Q-Tensor Model for Liquid Crsytals <span id='bitlink-525'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(525)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-525' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(525)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On Convergence Analysis of a First-Order Semi-Discrete Numerical Scheme for a Hydrodynamic Q-Tensor Model for Liquid Crsytals</b><br />Yukun Yue<br />Wednesday, March 1 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-124.html'>Exact Polynomialization and Quadratization of Nonlinear Dynamics - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>We present a convergence analysis of an unconditional energy-stable first-order semi-discrete numerical scheme designed for the hydrodynamic Q-tensor model based on the Invariant Quadratization Method(IEQ). This model couples a Navier-Stokes system for the flows and a parabolic type Q-tensor system governing the nematic crystal director fields. The invariant Quadratization Method enables us to construct a linear scheme for the systems, accelerating the computation speed. However, it introduces an auxiliary variable into the systems to replace the bulk potential energy. A typical problem is whether this new variable coincides with the original energy. In this work, we prove the stability properties of the scheme and show its convergence to a weak solution of the coupled liquid crystal system. In the weak sense, we have also demonstrated the equivalence of the solution for the reformulated and original systems. Numerical experiments are also provided.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75411' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

This identity includes a culture and set of practices that help define the community and its membership. Over time, some members of the community changes practices (to new best practices), and the community identity encourages these practices to be taken up by others in the community fairly quickly. People outside the community see these changes, and then also take up these practices. This talk will discuss this process, including examples such as practices around documentation and testing, and explain how these lead to more sustainable research software.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75706' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1434' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1434)' class='star'><span class='star1434'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (E104)</b> Andrew Turner, Challenges of Integrating Workflow Software with Multifactor Authentication: How can RSEs Work with System Administrators and Other Stakeholders to Enable Unattended Remote Access? <span id='bitlink-1318'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1318)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1318' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1318)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Challenges of Integrating Workflow Software with Multifactor Authentication: How can RSEs Work with System Administrators and Other Stakeholders to Enable Unattended Remote Access?</b><br />Andrew Turner<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-316.html'>Towards Improvement of Sustainability and Productivity for Research Software - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Workflow tools (e.g. AiiDA) are becoming more and more popular with researchers working on large-scale HPC systems due to their ability to simplify the management of more complex research requirements and improve the productivity of researchers. However, the increased focus of security on academic HPC systems is leading to multifactor authentication (MFA) processes, usually employing a time-based one-time password (TOPT), becoming commonplace. This causes a large problem for both researchers who wish to use workflow tools which need unattended access to HPC facilities, and for HPC service providers who want to enable research but improve system security. In this presentation I will briefly set the context for this issue before presenting some approaches that have been taken to enable such functionality on HPC services with MFA. I will conclude with showing why solving the problem sustainably requires both workflow software and HPC services to be designed with input from all parties; and why RSEs are the key personnel to enabling long-term, sustainable solutions to enable complex research workflows in a secure manner and improve researcher and HPC service productivity.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75706' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1435' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1435)' class='star'><span class='star1435'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (E104)</b> Claire Wyatt, Are You An RSE? <span id='bitlink-1319'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1319)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1319' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1319)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Are You An RSE?</b><br />Claire Wyatt<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-316.html'>Towards Improvement of Sustainability and Productivity for Research Software - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Did you start off as a researcher who spent time developing software to progress your research and then realised you enjoyed this work more than research? Or maybe you started off from a more conventional software-development background and are drawn to research by the challenge of using software to further research?     
A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in programming with an intricate understanding of research. Although this combination of skills is extremely valuable, these people lack a formal place in the academic system. Without a job title, it is difficult for people to rally around a cause and there is no easy way to recognise their contribution, to reward them, or to represent their views.  So in 2012, the term Research Software Engineer was created in 2012 and the community is now working to raise awareness of the role, bring RSEs together and advocate for more appropriate career recognition and promotion.      
Regardless of your formal job title, the attraction of being a Research Software Engineer is similar to that of being a researcher: the role attracts people who want to know how the world works. The Research Software Engineer works with researchers to gain an understanding of the problems they face, and then develops, maintains and extends software to provide the answers.    
This talk will cover the history of the RSE movement, what it has achieved, what’s coming up in 2023 and how you can get involved.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75706' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1436' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1436)' class='star'><span class='star1436'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (E104)</b> Anne Fouilloux, Building on Communities to Further Software Sustainability <span id='bitlink-1320'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1320)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1320' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1320)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Building on Communities to Further Software Sustainability</b><br />Anne Fouilloux<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-316.html'>Towards Improvement of Sustainability and Productivity for Research Software - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Software sustainability is increasingly recognised as a must in scientific research. Well-established tools for source code management, for software package (and dependency) management and/or application-level virtualisation (containerisation) are often instrumental in the development of software. No matter how “good” these tools alone can hardly ensure long-term sustainability. Teams and communities are equally or even more important than any technical solution chosen. Building community practices to ensure the long-term sustainability of software is rarely given priority in the context of scientific projects which heavily rely on them nonetheless. Co-developing “best practices” with communities proves to lead to a wider/better adoption, more efficient work/developments, higher quality documentation and training material/tutorials, a much flatter learning curve which makes it easier onboarding newcomers, and all that translates into a better take up by researchers. In this talk, the Nordic Infrastructure Community for Earth System Modelling Tools will explain how they have  placed people at the centre of the software development cycle to ensure its long-term sustainability. Successful examples will be presented as well as failures, to highlight what went well or wrong, respectively, and why. It will be discussed in particular the importance to go beyond its own team and community, and to think about a scientific project in a wider context e.g Open Science.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75706' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

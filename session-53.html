<h2>Computational Modeling of Coupled Multiscale Systems - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk239' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(239)' class='star'><span class='star239'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM (D402)</b> Zohar Yosibash, Autonomous Finite Elements in Clinical Practice - Coupling FEA with AI <span id='bitlink-222'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(222)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-222' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(222)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Autonomous Finite Elements in Clinical Practice - Coupling FEA with AI</b><br />Zohar Yosibash<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-53.html'>Computational Modeling of Coupled Multiscale Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Finite element analysis requires a qualified analyst to generate the necessary input data, verify the output and post-process the analysis results for a meaningful conclusion. The required expertise and labor efforts precluded the use of FEA in daily medical practice for example.     
Recent scientific advancements such as low-dose CT scans, machine  learning, and high order FEA which allows an inherent verification methodology of the numerical accuracy, make it possible to provide a fully autonomous process for assessing bone strength and fracture risk. This autonomous process, which we refer to as autonomous streamline, named autonomous finite element (AFE) analysis, introduces a paradigm shift in the use of FEA.      This talk addresses a novel AFE [Yosibash et al,  CMAME, 80(11), p 2417, 2020] for patient-specific analysis of human femurs used in clinical practice: it involves an automatic segmentation of femurs from CT-scans by U-Net, an automatic mesh generation and application of boundary conditions based on anatomical points, a high-order FE analysis with numerical error control, and an automatic report with a clear assessment of bone fracture risk. Two specific applications of AFE are presented:  a) Determination of the risk of fracture for patients with tumors of the femur [Sternheim et al,  Bone, 110, p215, 2018, &  BJJ, 102-B, p638, 2020].   b) Identifying patients with high hip fracture risk [Rotman et al,  BJJ, 103-B, p1497, 2021].    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75279' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk240' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(240)' class='star'><span class='star240'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (D402)</b> Ishaan Desai, An Adaptive and Flexible Software Framework for Two-Scale Coupled Problems <span id='bitlink-223'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(223)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-223' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(223)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Adaptive and Flexible Software Framework for Two-Scale Coupled Problems</b><br />Ishaan Desai<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-53.html'>Computational Modeling of Coupled Multiscale Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>For many challenging applications in simulation technology, micro-scale phenomena can dominate macro-scale behavior. Examples in this setting would be reactive porous-media flow and biomechanical models of human organs. We present a novel software framework to couple existing micro-scale and macro-scale simulations in a black-box fashion. We develop a software component which manages a set of micro simulations, and couples them to the macro simulation through the coupling library preCICE.  The broad aim is to develop macro-micro coupling methods and software that are independent not only of the concrete multiscale application but also of the used macro-scale and micro-scale software. While reusing key coupling implementations of preCICE (e.g., parallel communication and fixed-point acceleration schemes), we present a new software component called Micro Manager. The Micro Manager calls all micro-scale simulations as libraries in an adaptive manner and is itself coupled to the macro-scale simulation using preCICE.  The working of the Micro Manager is demonstrated using a two-scale heat conduction scenario in porous-media. In this case, each micro simulation consists of a grain structure which evolves depending on the temperature at the corresponding macro location. The effective thermal conductivity and material amounts at each macro point is computed by resolving a micro simulation. The micro simulations are run in an adaptive manner based on a similarity criterion.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75279' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk241' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(241)' class='star'><span class='star241'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (D402)</b> Rami Masri, A Decoupled Splitting Scheme Combined with a Discontinuous Galerkin Spatial Discretization for Solving the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Equations <span id='bitlink-224'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(224)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-224' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(224)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Decoupled Splitting Scheme Combined with a Discontinuous Galerkin Spatial Discretization for Solving the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Equations</b><br />Rami Masri<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-53.html'>Computational Modeling of Coupled Multiscale Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>We formulate and theoretically analyse a fully decoupled scheme for solving the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations. This scheme combines a pressure correction approach with interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations. We prove unique solvability and mass conservation. Under a CFL condition, we show that the order parameter is stable in the $L^\infty$ norm and  that the scheme is energy dissipative. Optimal a priori error rates in the broken $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms are proved. Our analysis is novel and robust in the sense that no artificial stabilization or regularization of the potential function are needed. We present numerical experiments which validate our theoretical results.

In order to decrease the computational effort one-dimensional (1D) Navier-Stokes equations are used to describe the flow field within this network. Since only large arteries are modeled by means of the 1D Navier-Stokes equations appropriate boundary conditions have to be imposed at the outlets of the considered network. One way to account for the missing vessels is to use systems of ordinary differential equations incorporating the resistance and capacity of the omitted vessels. Since they exhibit no space variable they are indicated as 0D models. All in all, this results in a 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. Parameters of the 0D models have to be chosen in a careful way to produce realistic simulation data. Using measurements of blood pressure curves, these parameters are calibrated formulating appropriate minimization problems. To avoid expensive evaluations of the respective cost functionals, physics informed neural networks are considered. For the solution of the minimization problems, we apply two different types of approaches: The first one is a classical gradient based method, while the second one uses features of quantum computers. In case of the second approach, we outline how data are transferred from a classical to a quantum computer and discuss new algorithmic aspects. The performance of both algorithms is illustrated by several numerical tests.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75279' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk243' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(243)' class='star'><span class='star243'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (D402)</b> Derek A.

One such set of structures, called Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS), are of particular interest. LCSs serve as a "skeleton" of a fluid flow, as they describe the regions of maximal attraction, repulsion, and shearing of a flow. Typically these structures are used to qualitatively analyze flow behavior. However, one may wish for these structures to appear in specific regions of a flow, as a means of flow control. Specifically, we are interested in the following problem: can we introduce a flow obstruction to guarantee a specified LCS. In this talk, we will discuss the feasibility of this problem, whether or not solutions to this problem exist, and how we may go about solving it both analytically and numerically.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75279' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

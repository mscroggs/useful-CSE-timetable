Current bulk schemes exhibit deficiencies that are due in part to their simplified representation of a complex natural state, and in part due to a fundamental lack of understanding of microphysical processes. These schemes also employ numerous ad-hoc assumptions, parameter choices, and model structural assumptions. To synthesize information from detailed process models and observations for improving bulk schemes, we have developed a novel probabilistic parameterization framework called the Bayesian Observationally-constrained Statistical-physical Scheme (BOSS). BOSS combines existing, though limited, process level microphysical knowledge with flexible process rate formulations and parameters trained to observations and data from detailed process models through Bayesian inference. The approach is flexible and can be used to examine structural choices in bulk schemes, particularly the functional form of process rates and the number of predicted cloud microphysical variables. This allows for systematic quantification of both parametric and structural uncertainty, which is not possible using traditional schemes. Results using an MCMC sampler with BOSS to constrain process rates and parameters with synthetic &#8220;observations' generated by a detailed bin microphysical model will be presented.

The long-term behavior of a system governed by the SCE is predictable, but trajectories can have a significant temporary sensitivity to initial conditions. In atmosphere models, this corresponds to uncertainty about when the system starts to produce a significant number of "rain-sized" drops.    
Such models can use "bin" microphysics schemes, which discretize the drop size distribution, to solve equations such as the SCE numerically. However, most models use cheaper "bulk" microphysics schemes, which describe the population of drops using only a few variables, e.g. total mass and number. These bulk schemes are reduced order models for microphysical systems, but the strong nonlinearity of the SCE makes conventional reduced order modeling techniques difficult to apply.    
We present a new method, Jacobian Estimation of Functional Error (JEFE), which uses an adjoint model to measure the predictability of bin model outputs from a small set of prognostic variables. This allows us to identify whether the given variables provide enough information to capture the system's dynamics, a prerequisite for an effective bulk scheme. Having chosen a set of variables, we can then produce a bulk scheme using data-driven methods, such as the Bayesian Observationally constrained Statistical-physical Scheme (BOSS).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75183' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk19' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(19)' class='star'><span class='star19'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM (G108)</b> Marcus Van Lier-Walqui, Bayesian Tuning of Earth System Models in Global and Single-Column Simulations, Constrained by Satellite Observations and High Resolution Models <span id='bitlink-19'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(19)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-19' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(19)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Bayesian Tuning of Earth System Models in Global and Single-Column Simulations, Constrained by Satellite Observations and High Resolution Models</b><br />Marcus Van Lier-Walqui<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-4.html'>Understanding Cloud Physics Using Stochastic, Dynamical, and Data-Driven Modeling - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Earth System Models solve the equations of motion for geophysical fluid flow on the globe numerically at discrete points on a 3D grid that spans the Earth. Numerous processes occur on sub-grid scales and cannot be explicitly resolved by grid-scale variables. And yet, these processes strongly affect grid-scale fluid motion as well as thermodynamical and radiative properties. Examples of these sub-grid processes include the “microphysics” of how cloud and precipitation particles grow and interact. There is necessary approximation in the modeling of sub-grid scale effects on the grid-scale variables; additionally many of the sub-grid processes are uncertain at any scale. These approximations and uncertainties result in forecast errors. Recently, efforts have been proposed to systematically optimize parameters of models of sub-grid processes using observations. One such approach has been used with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE climate model, informed by satellite observational data. The approach is Bayesian and employs a MCMC sampler in conjunction with machine learning emulators to estimate the probability density over 45 parameters for various sub-grid processes. We present this methodology, which uses a relatively small number (~500) of one-year global climate simulations, and also discuss the potential benefit of incorporating computationally inexpensive “single-column model” simulations that focus on specific regimes of climate system behavior.

In particular,  their spatial organisation appears to cause a strong impact of their radiative  properties and dynamical evolution. The precise mechanisms driving different  forms of convective organisation which arise both in nature and in simulations  are, however, currently unknown.    
Using unsupervised learning for identifying regimes of convective organisation  in the tropical Atlantic, we will show results from analysing: a) what the  radiative properties of different forms of organisation are, b) what  atmospheric characteristics coincide with different forms of organisation  and c) what transitions occur when following air-masses along Lagrangian  trajectories.  Specifically, we find: a) net radiation changes significantly  between different forms of organisation, b) agreement with previous studies on the  importance of boundary layer wind-speed and to some degree atmospheric  stability, and c) we are able to succinctly capture what transitions occur  between regimes.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75183' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

Despite the tremendous progress in computational resources and methodologies over the last two decades, these high-fidelity models are still computationally expensive and require a significant amount of expertise. Operator learning frameworks like Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently become popular due to their demonstrated capability to approximate nonlinear operators between infinite dimensional Banach spaces, thus allowing them to learn solution operators to the partial differential equations that describe various hydrodynamic processes. We explore the use of such operator inference methods to construct reduced order models (ROMs) that can approximate coupled coastal wave-circulation systems governed by shallow water hydrodynamics and high-fidelity wave approximation models. The efficiency and accuracy of these models are studied using both benchmark problems with analytical results as well as physically realistic 2D problems. We also investigate the optimal combination of physics-based regularization losses and required high-fidelity training data, as well as perform automated hyper-parameter searches to formulate design guidelines for future efforts in this area.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75833' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1714' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1714)' class='star'><span class='star1714'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM (G110)</b> Gabriele Santin, Probabilistic Sampling for High Dimensional Kernel Based Approximation <span id='bitlink-1571'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1571)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1571' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1571)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Probabilistic Sampling for High Dimensional Kernel Based Approximation</b><br />Gabriele Santin<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-379.html'>High-Fidelity and Data-Driven Methods for Multiscale and Multi-Physics Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Kernel based algorithm can be formulated in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, where functional analytical results can be used to provide guarantees on the performances of the algorithm.    
For data-based algorithms, the problem of sampling is of utmost importance. The P -greedy algorithm allows one to obtain in this setting a quasi-optimal sampling of the space, that can be used in its own or as a discretization to reduce infinite dimensional problem to finite ones.    
In this talk, we prove that the optimization step required by this algorithm may be reduced to a finite search over a sequence of randomly drawn points, thus significantly accelerating its computation especially in high dimension, while maintaining essentially the same error guarantees as the abstract algorithm, even if only in high probability. We furthermore discuss connections to the coresets for the comptuation of kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD).    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75833' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1715' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1715)' class='star'><span class='star1715'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM (G110)</b> Elena Zappon, Efficient Solution of Coupled Problems Through Deim-Based Data Projection Across Non-Conforming Interfaces <span id='bitlink-1572'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1572)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1572' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1572)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Solution of Coupled Problems Through Deim-Based Data Projection Across Non-Conforming Interfaces</b><br />Elena Zappon<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-379.html'>High-Fidelity and Data-Driven Methods for Multiscale and Multi-Physics Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Expensive multi-scale and multi-physics problems are nowadays part of cornerstone problems of applied sciences and engineering. One of the major challenges of coupled problems is to manage non-conforming meshes at the interface between two models and/or domains, due to different numerical schemes or domains discretizations employed. Moreover, very often complex submodels depend on (e.g., physical or geometrical) parameters. Knowing how outputs of interest are affected by parameter variations is key to gain useful insights of the described physics.    
In this talk we propose a parametric reduced order modeling (ROM) technique based on Reduced Basis methods, to fully reduce multi-scale and multi-  physics problems featuring interface non-conformity. We combine Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and discretized empirical interpolation method (DEIM) to represent each sub-problem solution, whereas Dirichlet and Neumann parameter dependent interface conditions are reconstructed and interpolated across non-conforming interfaces by means of DEIM.    
The proposed method can be regarded as an efficient alternative to numerical schemes such as domain-decomposition methods, reducing the costs of multi-query simulations.    
Numerical results on the coupled heart-torso model, a multi-physics model  arising in cardiac electrophysiology to simulate relevant clinical outputs (e.g. the ECG), show the feasibility of the proposed strategy in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75833' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1716' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1716)' class='star'><span class='star1716'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM (G110)</b> Tizian Wenzel, Two Layered Kernel Machines for Sparse Surrogate Modeling <span id='bitlink-1573'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1573)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1573' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1573)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Two Layered Kernel Machines for Sparse Surrogate Modeling</b><br />Tizian Wenzel<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-379.html'>High-Fidelity and Data-Driven Methods for Multiscale and Multi-Physics Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Kernel methods are popular, especially using easily implementable radial basis function (RBF) kernels. They usually make use of a length scale hyperparameter, which is usually tuned via costly cross validation.     
Here we leverage approaches and tools from the machine learning community to introduce structured deep kernel networks and two-layered kernel machines,  whereby the latter ones which can be seen as using hyperparameter optimized RBF kernels. These two-layered kernel machines allow to obtain smaller expansion sizes, thus yielding faster and cheaper surrogate models.    
The use of the proposed approach is highlighted on both synthesized as well as real data sets.

Managing the pressures by controlling injection/extraction is challenging because of complex heterogeneity in the subsurface. The heterogeneity typically requires high-fidelity physics-based models to make predictions on CO2 fate. Furthermore, characterizing the heterogeneity accurately is fraught with parametric uncertainty. Accounting for heterogeneity and uncertainty makes this a computationally-intensive problem challenging for current reservoir simulators. To tackle this, we use differentiable programming with a full-physics model and machine learning to determine the fluid extraction rates that prevent over-pressurization at critical reservoir locations. We use DPFEHM framework, which has trustworthy physics based on the standard two-point flux finite volume discretization and is also automatically differentiable like machine learning models. Our physics-informed machine learning framework uses convolutional neural networks to learn an appropriate extraction rate based on the permeability field. We also perform a hyperparameter search to improve the model’s accuracy. We constructed and tested a sufficiently accurate simulator that is 400 000 times faster than the underlying physics-based simulator, allowing for near real-time analysis and robust uncertainty quantification.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75833' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

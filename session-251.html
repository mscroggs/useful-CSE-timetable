Developing efficient yet accurate mathematical models to describe these non-equilibrium flow problems is of interest to researchers work in the field of rarified gas dynamics.  In kinetic gas theory, moment method is a technique to  reduce complexity of an underlying kinetic equation by suitable approximation. In this talk, we discuss derivation of general moment systems from the Boltzmann equation for mono-atomic gases and present a generalized numerical framework based on finite-element-method to solve well-defined arbitrary order of moment systems. We highlight the benefits of our proposed framework by discussing the mathematical properties such as symmetry, generality,   linearity, and more. This talk also covers several example problems involving non-equilibrium scenarios.

These equations require closure relations for to balance the number of unknowns with the number of equations. Such closure may be attained by the Chapman-Enskog method which assumes that the distribution takes the form of a perturbation series in powers of the Knudsen number scaled by a Maxwellian. By using a scaled Boltzmann equation to solve for successive orders of the perturbation series, we obtain familiar fluid dynamic equations: Euler, Navier-Stokes-Fourier, Burnett, and so on.    
Whilst considering the linearized Boltzmann equation, we propose a different ansatz. Instead of a perturbation series, we use the variational multiscale (VMS) method to split our unknown into a coarse scale term from the space of collision invariants and a fine scale term from the orthogonal complement to the collision invariants.     We show that the Chapman-Enskog method can be viewed as particular way of approximating the fine scale term under the VMS formulation. By approximating the fine scale term differently, we are able to derive an alternative to the Burnett equations (i.e. a correction that is a step above Navier-Stokes-Fourier) for which we can show entropy stability. To show some benchmark results, these alternative equations necessitate extra boundary conditions which we motivate by considering the space-velocity weak form of the linearized Boltzmann.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75577' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1145' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1145)' class='star'><span class='star1145'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (D402)</b> Maksim Melnik, Continuum Approaches for Strongly Non-Equilibrium Flows <span id='bitlink-1059'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1059)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1059' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1059)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Continuum Approaches for Strongly Non-Equilibrium Flows</b><br />Maksim Melnik<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-251.html'>Efficient Numerical Frameworks for Kinetic And Related Models - Part II of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>The kinetic theory finds its application in an extremely wide range of problems, ranging from environmental problems to the planetary entry. It is used to describe non-equilibrium flows for completely different conditions. However, there is still no single universal, accurate and computationally inexpensive approach suitable for various degrees of gas rarefaction, characterized by the Knudsen number, Kn. When solving problems, it may be necessary to simulate at relatively low values of Kn corresponding to the slip flow regime, where the often-used DSMC approach becomes computationally too expensive. In such conditions, continuum approaches become relevant. The talk is devoted to actively developing continuum approaches using generalized Chapman-Enskog method. One-temperature, multi-temperature and state-to-state descriptions will be considered. The methods used to speed up calculations will be highlighted, including the possibility of combining different approaches. Particular attention will be paid to validation, which is necessary before using detailed and resource-intensive approaches.

This prohibits fine numerical discretizations which are essential for the construction of accurate treatment plans.      We use a dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) of the particle density to evolve the solution of the continuous slowing down approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation on a low-rank manifold in time. Here the energy is treated as a pseudo-time and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt the rank in energy. The transport equation is split into collided and uncollided particles through a collision source method. Uncollided particles are described analytically, guaranteeing low computational costs, whereas collided particles are represented by a low-rank solution. The resulting method is more efficient concerning both run-time and memory than conventional radiation transport solvers and agrees well with conventional deterministic solvers as well as state-of-the-art Monte Carlo codes.     We further extend our model from electron to the more clinically relevant proton transport, which typically requires finer discretizations due to the extremely forward-peaked scattering and sharp peak in the energy deposition curve. We show that DLRA is well-suited for proton dose computations, already at significantly lower rank than required for electrons.

"Goal-oriented adaptive finite element multilevel Monte Carlo with convergence rates." Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering (2022)] method to solve an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) with lognormal random input data, where the PDE model is subject to geometry-induced singularity.     
The previous work [Moon, K-S., et al. "Convergence rates for an adaptive dual weighted residual finite element algorithm." BIT Numerical Mathematics 46.2 (2006)] developed convergence rates for a goal-oriented adaptive algorithm based on isoparametric d-linear quadrilateral finite element approximations and the dual weighted residual error representation in the deterministic setting. This algorithm refines the mesh based on the error contribution to the QoI.     
This work aims to combine MLMC and the adaptive finite element solver. Contrary to the standard Multilevel Monte Carlo methods, where samples are computed using a discretization-based numerical method, whose resolution is linked to the level, our AMLMC algorithm uses a sequence of tolerances as the levels. Specifically, for a given realization of the input coefficient and a given accuracy level, the AMLMC constructs its approximate sample as the ones using the first mesh in the sequence of deterministic, non-uniform meshes generated by the above-mentioned adaptive algorithm that satisfies the sample-dependent bias constraint.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75577' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

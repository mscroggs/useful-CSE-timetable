These different aspects of the same physical problem have to be properly connected and every step has to be verified and validated in the interest of a medical application.  The models require the knowledge of various parameters and some may be important factors in the development of pathologies.  However, despite recent significant advances in medical data acquisition, only some parameters and their variability are known, but others cannot be directly measured.   To identify the main factors that influence the biomechanical behavior of the eye, we, therefore, need to study the influence of these parameters through an uncertainty quantification (UQ) process which requires many evaluations of the models.  Since 3D models are not amenable directly to UQ, a reduction step is needed to mitigate the computational cost.    
We previously conducted a complete UQ analysis on a 0D reduced model.  In the present talk, we propose a strategy to carry out further analysis using reduced order methods and in particular the reduced basis method.  We present the application of these methods in the context of both continuous Galerkin and Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin formulations.  We discuss then the implementation with the library Feel++.  Finally, we apply the methodology to some advanced ocular models and report our findings.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75845' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1726' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1726)' class='star'><span class='star1726'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (D406)</b> C&#233;line Van Landeghem, A Computational Framework for the Simulation of Micro-Swimming <span id='bitlink-1583'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1583)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1583' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1583)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Computational Framework for the Simulation of Micro-Swimming</b><br />C&#233;line Van Landeghem<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-123.html'>Advances in the Multiscale and Multiphysics Modeling of Biological Fluids: Theoretical and Numerical Aspects - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>We are currently developing a computational framework for swimming simulation in order to address problems where rigid or deformable bodies move in Newtonian and complex fluids.   The objective is to investigate the interactions of biological micro-organisms and micro-robots with their environment, in order to propose efficient driving strategies and obtain insights into propulsion at this scale.    
In this talk, we present the state of the art of our micro-swimming computational framework, capable of simulating sperm cells and biologically inspired micro-organisms as well as handling  contact in some of the arising fluid-structure problems.  The mathematical formulation and computational aspects of this fluid-structure interaction will be presented, ranging from the governing equations and gait models that are currently supported to the numerical solution of the swimming problem. A selection of applications and results will be presented as well.

Metabolism, in turn, relies on the delivery of metabolites and removal of toxic byproducts through diffusion processes and the cerebral blood flow. A comprehensive mathematical model of brain metabolism, should account not only for the biochemical processes and the interaction of neurons and astrocytes, but also the diffusion of metabolites. We present a computational methodology based on a multidomain modeling view of the brain tissue using a homogenization argument to account for the diffusion processes. In our spatially distributed compartment model, communication between compartments occur both through local transport fluxes, as is the case within local astrocyte-neuron complexes, and through diffusion of some substances in some of the compartments. Our model assumes that diffusion takes place in the extracellular space (ECS) and in the astrocyte compartment, where its strength depends on the strength of the gap-junctions. The diffusion process is implemented numerically by means of a finite element method (FEM) based spatial discretization, and robust stiff solvers are used to time integrate the resulting large systems. Computed experiments investigate how the effects of ECS tortuosity, gap junction strength and spatial anisotropies in the astrocyte network affect the brain energy metabolism.

It brings maternal and fetal blood close together, allowing nutrients to diffuse across thin separating barriers in the fetal villous tree structure. Structurally, the placenta is divided into placentones: compartments that are partially separated by septal walls.    
An approach to modelling maternal blood flow is to treat the fetal villous tree as a porous medium; several authors have utilised this on representative placentone geometries, mainly focusing on arterial supply. However, whilst these simulations are a useful indicator of organ-level behaviour, they fail to describe the effects of the blood flux between neighbouring placentones, as well as neglecting the importance of maternal venous return. In 2020, a new phenomenon was discovered called the placental contraction, which is yet to be mathematically modelled.     
I will present some in-silico organ-scale maternal blood flow simulations, using Navier-Stokes and Brinkman equations to model blood flow on representative placental geometries, coupled to a reaction-advection-diffusion equation to model nutrient transport. I will show notable blood flux passing between placentones, the importance of considering maternal venous return paths on the uniformity of oxygen exchange, and that the recently-observed placental contraction phenomenon could be vital in redistributing blood and encouraging venous return.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75845' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

<h2>Stochastic and Multiscale Modeling Approaches for Interfacial Systems - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk873' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(873)' class='star'><span class='star873'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Michail Stamatakis, Conquering the Mesoscale in the Simulation of Surfaces and Interfaces via Distributed Lattice-Based Kinetic Monte Carlo <span id='bitlink-803'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(803)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-803' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(803)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Conquering the Mesoscale in the Simulation of Surfaces and Interfaces via Distributed Lattice-Based Kinetic Monte Carlo</b><br />Michail Stamatakis<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-191.html'>Stochastic and Multiscale Modeling Approaches for Interfacial Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations are instrumental in the multi-scale modelling of surfaces and interfaces. As an example, such simulations are frequently used to elucidate the complex reaction dynamics exhibited by solid catalysts and predict macroscopic performance metrics, such as activity and selectivity. However, the length- and time-scales accessible by sequential KMC implementations are limited, and handling lattices with millions of sites has been prohibitive due to large memory requirements and long simulation times. Domain decomposition approaches could address these limitations, but they require sophisticated algorithms for conflict resolution at the boundaries between subdomains. Jeffersonâ€™s Time-Warp algorithm addresses this challenge via rollbacks and re-simulations which correct any and all causality violations arising transiently during simulation. Thus, the exact dynamics of the chemical master equation are finally reproduced.    
In this work, we have coupled the Time-Warp algorithm with the Graph-Theoretical KMC framework enabling the handling of complex adsorbate lateral interactions and reaction events within large lattices. This approach has been implemented in our general-purpose KMC software Zacros, and has been validated and benchmarked for efficiency in model systems as well as realistic chemistries. This work makes Zacros the first-of-its-kind general-purpose KMC code with distributed parallelisation capability to study heterogeneous catalysts.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75497' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk874' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(874)' class='star'><span class='star874'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Patrick Gel&#223;, Solving Kinetic Master Equations with Tensor Trains <span id='bitlink-804'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(804)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-804' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(804)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Solving Kinetic Master Equations with Tensor Trains</b><br />Patrick Gel&#223;<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-191.html'>Stochastic and Multiscale Modeling Approaches for Interfacial Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>The performance of a catalytic surface depends on physical processes taking place on multiple time scales. On the time scale of molecular motion, chemical surface reactions are rare transitions between metastable basins in free-energy landscapes. The interplay of these elementary reactions making up the catalytic cycle can be modeled as a Markov jump process on the lattice of adsorption sites. The corresponding Markovian master equation describing the stochastic reaction kinetics, however, is usually too high-dimensional to be solved with standard numerical techniques and one has to rely on sampling approaches such as the kinetic Monte Carlo method.   	  In this talk, we show how to mitigate the curse of dimensionality for the direct solution of the kinetic master equation by exploiting tensor decompositions. We use the tensor-train format to construct probability distributions as well as transition-rate matrices in form of networks of so-called tensor cores representing the different adsorption sites. The performance of the approach is demonstrated on a reduced model for the CO oxidation on the RuO$_2$(110) surface. We investigate the complexity for increasing system size as well as for various reaction conditions and illustrate the advantage over stochastic simulation approaches by a sequence of problems with increasing stiffness.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75497' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk875' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(875)' class='star'><span class='star875'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Graeme Henkelman, From Transition States to Dynamics Over Long Time Scales <span id='bitlink-805'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(805)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-805' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(805)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>From Transition States to Dynamics Over Long Time Scales</b><br />Graeme Henkelman<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-191.html'>Stochastic and Multiscale Modeling Approaches for Interfacial Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>For many chemical reactions and diffusion mechanisms in materials, transition states can be characterized by saddle points on the potential energy surface.  Saddle point finding methods can be classified into two categories.  First, there are methods including the nudged elastic band and string methods which require knowledge of both reactant and product states to determine a minimum energy path connecting them.  These so-called double-ended methods are widely used with density functional theory to determine rates of anticipated reaction mechanisms.  A second class of single-ended methods, generally based upon minimum-mode following techniques, require only the initial state to determine possible reaction mechanisms leading to possibly unknown product states.  These single-ended methods require more sampling but they have the power to map out reactions on a potential surface with minimal user bias.  I will discuss application of these saddle point finding methods to accelerating molecular dynamics simulations, such as through the hyperdynamics approach.  Also, upon discovering a set of reaction mechanisms from an initial state, minimum mode following saddle searches can be coupled to kinetic Monte Carlo to model the evolution of atomic scale systems over the time scales of the reactions.  This adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo method can, in favorable cases, even model the evolution of atomic scale systems to experimental time scales of seconds or minutes -- orders of magnitude longer time scales than can be reached with molecular dynamics.  A frank assessment of the limitations of the methods will also be given.  Examples will include molecular reactions on metal surfaces and surface segregation in bimetallic nanoparticles.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75497' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk876' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(876)' class='star'><span class='star876'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Raffaele Cheula, Modeling and Design of Single-Atom Alloy Catalysts <span id='bitlink-806'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(806)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-806' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(806)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Modeling and Design of Single-Atom Alloy Catalysts</b><br />Raffaele Cheula<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-191.html'>Stochastic and Multiscale Modeling Approaches for Interfacial Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>In this contribution, we apply data-driven modeling - i.e., molecular simulations and machine learning (ML) - for the study of CO2 hydrogenation processes (e.g., reverse water-gas shift) on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, i.e., diluted bimetallic materials able to break the scaling relationships that limit conventional catalysts [RT Hannagan, et al., Chem Rev 120, 12044-12088, 2020]. We target a wide combinatory space of elements of the periodic table, which makes a direct study with density-functional theory (DFT) computationally prohibitive. Therefore, we produce a database of DFT-calculated energies on a limited number of SAAs and we apply physics-inspired ML techniques for the extrapolation to a wide range of materials. We use a graph-based Gaussian Process Regression ML model (i.e., WWL-GPR) to calculate adsorption energies [W Xu, et al., Nat Comput Sci 2, 443-450, 2022], and simpler models (e.g., multivariate regressions) to estimate the activation energies of the new materials. We employ microkinetic modeling to simulate the reaction kinetics; then, we apply Sensitivity Analysis and Uncertainty Quantification to identify the parameters that can improve the model predictions, and we refine them with additional DFT calculations. The application of the framework to CO2 hydrogenation allows us to rationalize how reaction mechanisms and catalytic activity change with the catalyst composition, paving the way toward the design and nano-engineering of SAA catalysts.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75497' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

L. Penrose). One of these puzzles asks the reader to design a smooth closed reflecting surface (mirror) which contains two regions with the property that a source of light placed in one cannot be seen from the other. This "room" has become known as the unilluminable room and there are now numerous fascinating solutions to the problem.     
The original puzzle assumes that the light is described by rays (a so-called billiards problem) so that the light cannot “bend around corners”. Here we model light by solving the Helmholtz equation with a point source in one of the regions of the room and study (among other things) how dark the other region of the room actually is as we change the frequency of the light-source.             </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75521' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk962' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(962)' class='star'><span class='star962'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM (E107)</b> Martin Halla, On the Stable Discretization of the Vectorial Equations of Stellar Oscillations <span id='bitlink-886'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(886)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-886' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(886)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On the Stable Discretization of the Vectorial Equations of Stellar Oscillations</b><br />Martin Halla<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-210.html'>Computational Challenges in Wave Theory: Methods and Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>We consider the time-harmonic equation of stellar oscillations, which is a Galbrun-like equation with additional rotational and gravitational terms. The main difficulty of this equation is that it is not only indefinite, but it contains differential operators with opposite signs, and recently its well-posedness was analyzed in [M. Halla, T. Hohage, On the well-posedness of the damped time-harmonic Galbrun equation and the equations of stellar oscillations, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53(4) (2021), pp. 4068–4095]. In this talk we discuss how to construct and analyze convergent discretizations. To this end we report a new weak T-compatibility framework and apply it to certain $H^1$-conforming finite element methods. The main assumption on the finite element spaces is a uniformly stable invertibility of the divergence operator, which is ensured under certain conditions on the meshes and the polynomial degree. Thus we obtain a family of reliable finite element methods, for which we present computational results. Details can be found in the report [M. Halla, C. Lehrenfeld, P. Stocker, A new T-compatibility condition and its application to the discretization of the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation, arXiv:2209.01878].    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75521' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk963' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(963)' class='star'><span class='star963'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM (E107)</b> S&#233;bastien P.

Applications are in data assimilation strategies or the discretisation of absorbing boundary conditions. More precisely the aim of our work is to propose a discretization process that enables to preserve the exponential stability at the discrete level as well as a high order consistency when using a high-order finite element approximation. The main idea is to add to the wave equation a stabilizing term which damps the high-frequency oscillating components of the solutions such as spurious waves. This term is built from a discrete multiplier analysis that proves the exponential stability of the semi-discrete problem at any order without affecting the order of convergence.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75521' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk964' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(964)' class='star'><span class='star964'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM (E107)</b> Sumit K.

The three-dimensional linearized theory of elastic waves and the piecewise homogeneous body model has been employed to formulate the problem. The mathematical modelling has been carried out in two independent cases. In the first case a solid cylinder encased in a hollow cylinder embedded in an infinite elastic medium has been considered. Whereas second case comprises of hollow cylinder of finite thickness in place of solid cylinder. By means of Murnaghan potential the mechanical characteristics of the three materials have been used. Further, the dispersion relations for both the cases have been obtained in terms of the Bessel and modified Bessel functions. In order to validate the present findings, two particular cases have derived which matches with the previous works. The first case is obtained by removing the outermost cylinder while the second case has been derived by removing the imperfection in addition to that. To summarize the computations, a complete numerical simulation has been carried out, and graphical illustrations have been shown to aid the mathematical analyses.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75521' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

<h2>Cross-Cutting Aspects of Utilizing Exascale Platforms for High-Fidelity CFD - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1733' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1733)' class='star'><span class='star1733'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM (G106)</b> Adalberto Perez, Analysis and Compression of Temporal CFD Data Sets Using Streaming and Parallel SVD <span id='bitlink-1586'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1586)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1586' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1586)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Analysis and Compression of Temporal CFD Data Sets Using Streaming and Parallel SVD</b><br />Adalberto Perez<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-382.html'>Cross-Cutting Aspects of Utilizing Exascale Platforms for High-Fidelity CFD - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Computational Fluid Dynamics is characterized by its production of high dimensional data, which must often be treated to extract useful and interpretable information. For this purpose, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a powerful tool used in various fields under different names, is often utilized. The main characteristic of the method, as used in fluid dynamics, is to decompose an original data set into a set of basis functions dependent on space and coefficients dependent on time. Given that SVD provides an optimal representation of the original data set, it is often used for data analysis and compression, since low energetic modes can be discarded while keeping a reasonable reconstruction of the original fields. The present work takes advantage of the temporally dynamic and spatially partitioned nature of the domains in turbulence simulations by calculating local SVDs in different regions of the flow field. This approach exploits the locality of the flow features which allows SVD to find a sparser basis to describe the flow and, in turn, increase compression. Apart from the inherently parallel nature of the approach, we calculate the local SVDs in a streaming manner such that, in general, the original data does not need to be stored but can be analyzed at simulation runtime. Thus, our approach provides a way to compress data with local SVDs, obtain global POD modes, and a simple way to calculate DMD, another modal decomposition used for understanding flow dynamics.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75848' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1734' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1734)' class='star'><span class='star1734'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM (G106)</b> Matthias Meinke, Advanced Simulation Methods for the Prediction of Aerodynamically Generated Noise <span id='bitlink-1587'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1587)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1587' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1587)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Advanced Simulation Methods for the Prediction of Aerodynamically Generated Noise</b><br />Matthias Meinke<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-382.html'>Cross-Cutting Aspects of Utilizing Exascale Platforms for High-Fidelity CFD - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>The mitigation of aerodynamically generated sound is an important technical field. It usually requires an accurate prediction of the turbulent flow and a computational aeroacoustics method to predict the noise generation and the propagating sound field. In this paper, a direct-hybrid simulation method is presented, in which a solver for the flow field is directly coupled to a solution of the acoustic perturbation equations. It uses an interleaved execution pattern such that an efficient parallelization is achieved also on high-performance computing (HPC) systems, see [Michael Schlottke-Lakemper, Ansgar Niemöller, Matthias Meinke, Wolfgang Schröder,  Efficient parallelization for volume-coupled multiphysics simulations on hierarchical Cartesian grids, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Volume 352, 2019, Pages 461-487, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2019.04.032]  [Ansgar Niemöller, Michael Schlottke-Lakemper, Matthias Meinke, Wolfgang Schröder, Dynamic load balancing for direct-coupled multiphysics simulations, Computers & Fluids, Volume 199, 2020, 104437, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compfluid.2020.104437].   Several applications are presented for which the HPC performance is analyzed. For a landing gear noise mitigation is studied by applying fairings made of porous material. Other large scale applications will be discussed, such as the noise generated by jets from chevron nozzles or from propellers interacting with a downstream located wing.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75848' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1735' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1735)' class='star'><span class='star1735'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM (G106)</b> Saleh Rezaeiravesh, Hierarchical Bayesian Multifidelity Modelling Applied to Turbulent Flows <span id='bitlink-1588'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1588)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1588' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1588)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hierarchical Bayesian Multifidelity Modelling Applied to Turbulent Flows</b><br />Saleh Rezaeiravesh<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-382.html'>Cross-Cutting Aspects of Utilizing Exascale Platforms for High-Fidelity CFD - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Conducting high-fidelity studies in fluid mechanics can be prohibitively expensive, particularly at high Reynolds numbers. Thus, it is necessary to develop accurate yet cost-effective models for outer-loop problems involving turbulent flows. One way is to use multifidelity models (MFMs) which aim at accurately predicting quantities of interest (QoIs) and their stochastic moments by combining the data obtained from different fidelities. When constructing MFMs, a balance is sought between a few expensive (but accurate) simulations and many more inexpensive (but potentially less accurate) simulations. Two main characteristics have to be considered. 1) there is a distinguishable hierarchy in the fidelity of the turbulence simulation approaches such as RANS, hybrid RANS-LES, LES, and DNS. 2) the outcome of any of these approaches can be potentially uncertain due to various inherent uncertainties.  We further develop and apply a MFM that is consistent with these characteristics and is based on the Gaussian processes (GP). The fidelity-specific calibration parameters as well as the hyperparameters appearing in the GPs are simultaneously estimated within a Bayesian framework. The Bayesian inference is done using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, and the predictions of the MFM are accompanied by estimates of the confidence intervals. The efficiency and performance of this MFM are illustrated for various problems involving turbulent flows.

One potentially relevant approach is a Flettner rotor, i.e. a rotating cylinder that uses the Magnus effect to generate lift. While Flettner rotors have been considered in experiments and RANS simulations, no direct numerical simulation (DNS) ofa Flettner rotor, focusing on the interaction with the surrounding turbulent boundary layer has been carried out. Our simulation demonstrates our new CFD code Neko, a solver that owes its homage to Nek5000. Neko is based on similar numerical methods, but differs in that it also accommodates modern computer architectures such as GPUs and has an object-oriented codebase written in modern Fortran. Special emphasis has been put on portability, scalability and the possibility to extend to code easily with new features; thereby keeping the complexity for the domain scientist to a minimum. The flow case under consideration is a Flettner rotor submerged in a turbulent boundary layer, consisting of 1M spectral elements, which turns into 0.5B unique grid points. We discuss the strong scaling efficiency with comparing several architectures, including latest GPUs. We observe excellent parallel scaling, up to hundreds of nodes. Our initial findings for the lift are in excellent agreement with experimental data. We further observe that there is a strong interaction between the rotor and the turbulent boundary layer, in terms of modified coherent structures.

In particular, performing wall-resolved large eddy simulations (LES) can predict the steady state performance and help improve the reactor design. High order method is known to be able to capture the turbulence with minimal numerical dissipation. Our spectral element methods code, Nek5000/NekRS, uses curved hexahedral elements that takes O(n) storage where $n=EN^3$ is the number of grid points for E elements and polynomial order N, and with an efficient preconditioner, the computational cost is only O(nN). However, elevating N requires 2-3 orders of magnitude fewer elements than standard finite elements, which brings challenges to meshing complex geometries at large scales.    
We present an all-hex meshing strategy for randomly packed spheres in pebble bed reactors. With Voronoi decomposition, spheres are bounded by cells and the facets are tessellated into quads that are swept to the sphere to generate a base mesh. The singularities at contact points between spheres are covered by the overlapping region to achieve the target void fraction that realizes the correct pressure drop. We generate high quality meshes with $10^2–10^5$ spheres using ~300 elements per sphere. We present mesh quality metrics and its impact to the solver performance under different preconditioners which realizes fluid simulations for full-core pebble bed reactors at exascale platforms.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75848' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

<h2>Multiscale Methods for Kinetic Models: Theory and Numerics - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk931' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(931)' class='star'><span class='star931'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (D507)</b> Arthur Loison, Kinetic-Based Two-Phase Flow Model: a Reduced-Order Model of Polydisperse Oscillating Droplets with Geometrical Variables <span id='bitlink-857'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(857)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-857' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(857)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Kinetic-Based Two-Phase Flow Model: a Reduced-Order Model of Polydisperse Oscillating Droplets with Geometrical Variables</b><br />Arthur Loison<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-204.html'>Multiscale Methods for Kinetic Models: Theory and Numerics - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>We consider two-phase compressible flows involving both separate regime where the interface dynamics is &#8220;smooth' and disperse regimes i.e. sprays of droplets. We introduced multi-fluid two-scale models whose large-scale is adapted to separate regime while the small-scale is for the disperse regime. The modeling of the latter relies on a kinetic modeling of the small-scale disperse phase. Originally proposed by [Williams, 1958], a kinetic-based model fits well the disperse configuration when the droplets are sufficiently distant from each other. However, the separate regime is not suited for such a description and averaged descriptions of the dynamics have been privileged. [Pope, 1988] proposed a probabilistic framework for separate regime, and it has been successfully extended to disperse flows by [Essadki, 2019] for spherical droplets. These works also underlined the key role of geometrical variables in the construction of a unified model for all regimes.    
This work proposes a polydisperse flow model of oscillating droplets extending Essadki's work. First, we propose a new set of geometrical variables along with the associated Williams-Boltzmann equation, recovering the work of [O’Rourke & Amsden, 1987]. Second, the moments compatible with Pope’s framework are identified. Finally, we propose realizable schemes [Ait Ameur, 2022] for simulations of the spray with both monodisperse and polydisperse closures.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75514' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk932' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(932)' class='star'><span class='star932'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D507)</b> Marwa Shahine, Fredholm Theory for the Linearized Boltzmann Operator for Polyatomic Gases <span id='bitlink-858'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(858)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-858' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(858)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fredholm Theory for the Linearized Boltzmann Operator for Polyatomic Gases</b><br />Marwa Shahine<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-204.html'>Multiscale Methods for Kinetic Models: Theory and Numerics - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>This talk is devoted to the Fredholm property of the linearized Boltzmann operator for a mixture of polyatomic gases with a continuous internal energy variable. The collision operator is constructed according to a Borggnakke-Larsen procedure. The linearized operator around equilibrium is written as a perturbation of a multiplication operator. We prove that the perturbation operator is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator and the multiplication operator is coercive. This yields the Fredholm property of the linearized Boltzmann operator.

By reconstructing the basis functions, the distribution function is expanded to a finite number of terms with $O(Kn^3)$ accuracy where $Kn$ is the Knudsen number. The resulting system of moment equations based on such expansion is shown to have a symmetric structure. We also propose the Onsager boundary conditions for the moment equations. The model is then tested for one-dimensional stationary channel problems, and numerical experiments are carried out to show the performance of our model.

The multi-scale nature of those equations leads to numerical challenges in terms of asymptotic behaviour to recover all Knudsen number flows. Considering this challenge, the UGKS (Unified Gaz Kinetic scheme) has been developed by K. Xu for the BGK model. This characteristic based scheme correctly captures both the continuum and rarefied flow regimes, with a time step much larger than the collision time. However, the problem’s dimension induces a huge computational cost.    
Under certain assumptions, moments models of those kinetic equations allow to reduce the velocity space dimension by assuming the distribution function shape. Elaborating robust asymptotic preserving schemes for those models is also challenging. Following L. Mieussens work on an adaptation of UGKS to a linear kinetic model of radiative transfer theory, we propose a new numerical scheme based on UGKS for the associated M1 model. We prove that this new scheme preserves the moments achievability and ensures the entropy decreases.

It is a significant safety concern for the aeronautic industry since it can lead to dramatic events. HAIC and recently MUSIC-haic models are developed in CEDRE solver, an ONERA's CFD code, to help the aeronautic industry to assess ice crystal icing on new products and future generations of aircraft engines and meet certification requirements.   This study considers the numerical simulation of ice crystal trajectories around an airplane fuselage nose. First, the aerodynamics airflow field is investigated. Then, trajectories and the associated fragmentation dynamics on walls are considered. Numerical simulation with a full deposition model is compared to numerical simulations with two different fragmentation models: HAIC and MUSIC-haic models. The comparison between the fragmentation models aims at assessing the capabilities of the recently proposed ice crystal fragmentation model (MUSIC-haic) with respect to the state-of-the-art model (HAIC). Both models show significant deviation from the full deposition model, therefore stating the relative importance of particle fragmentation on particle concentration along the fuselage nose. Although the two fragmentation models show some agreement, they also exhibit a large discrepancy in the fragmentation process.   	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75514' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

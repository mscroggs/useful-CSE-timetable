Compression techniques that eliminate redundancy and bits of marginal accuracy in floating-point arrays are commonly employed in many scientific applications to deal with this bottleneck. However, the variety of post-processing analyses performed by domain scientists causes regular compression workflows to be conservative and achieve low reduction ratios. In this context, progressive data compression and retrieval arise as a solution for achieving higher overall ratios.  Moreover, it allows for the adaptive handling of compressed data according to the needs of a given post-processing task. Currently, a few algorithms natively support progressive data processing. In this work, we present a general framework for adding progressiveness in terms of precision to scientific data compressors. Our framework is based on a multiple-component representation where each new component reduces the error between the original and compressed fields. We have implemented it on top of the ZFP, SZ, MGARD, and SPERR compressors, and, in this presentation, we discuss results obtained with several data fields from the SDRBENCH collection. Numerical results show that our approach is effective in terms of accuracy compared to each of the standalone compressors it builds upon.

During the past 5-6 years, we have witnessed a significant diversification of use cases ranging from classic visualization to more advanced lossy compression of data in communications or memory. We are also observing a blooming of lossy compression algorithms and, more importantly, continuous progress in compression quality, speed, and ratio. The lossy compression methodology has also progressed drastically with the SDRBench benchmark, the Libpressio unified API, and the Zchecker error analysis tool. However, a fundamental part is missing: the estimation of bounds of lossy compressibility. We have the Shannon entropy to compute the maximum compressibility of a data set from entropy coding. But there is no such result about the lossy compressibility of scientific data. We  can formulate the research question as: “Can we come up with the equivalent of a roof line of lossy compressibility?” Answering this question is fundamental for the research on algorithms for lossy compression of scientific data. This talk will review recent progress in lossy compression for scientific data and in lossy compressibility bound estimation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75612' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1231' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1231)' class='star'><span class='star1231'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (E102)</b> Alyson Fox, Further Investigative Analysis of ZFP Compression <span id='bitlink-1141'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1141)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1141' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1141)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Further Investigative Analysis of ZFP Compression</b><br />Alyson Fox<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-270.html'>Recent Advances in Lossy Compression and Data Reduction Methods for Scientific Data - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>Typically, the error from any lossy compression algorithm is deemed acceptable as the data gathered is noisy, either from simulation error, such as truncation, iteration and round-off error, or observational error, such as finite precision measurements and measurement noise. In many statistical analysis applications, additional assumptions on the error are applied that may not be valid in practice. Some emerging tools provide post-analysis of the compressor for the original dataset; however, this is one instance where assumptions about the compressor may mislead users. The focus of this talk is to provide additional theoretical understanding of the components of the ZFP lossy floating-point compressor, ensuring the assumptions we have empirically studied are indeed valid.

The original paper  was cited over 30,000 times in only 16 years (2006-2022). It purports to exert data compression at the phase of  signal acquisition. However, compressed sensing massively loses signal quality. In theory, it violates fundamental  principle of approximation theory, which spawned the enormous success of data compression technologies. We  exemplify a new mathematical theory and method for high efficiency imaging. In compliance with the principle of  best n-term approximation and based on discovery of a new logical phenomenon, high efficiency sensing radically  rectifies mathematical rationale, while immensely improves technical performance. The core idea is simple yet  powerful. High efficiency denotes high quality plus high speed.

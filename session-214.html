Unlike its matrix counterpart, the spectral measure of a self-adjoint operator may have an absolutely continuous component and an associated density function, e.g., in applications posed on unbounded domains. However, there has been no method able to compute spectral measures of general infinite-dimensional self-adjoint operators, with previous efforts focused on classes of operators that carry a lot of structure. The SpecSolve package [Colbrook, Horning, Townsend, SIAM Rev., 63(3) (2021), pp. 489–524] computes spectral measures by combining state-of-the-art adaptive spectral methods with an efficient resolvent-based strategy. By dealing with operators directly, as opposed to previous "discretise-then-solve" techniques, we construct methods with arbitrarily large rates of convergence that recover the spectral measures of general self-adjoint ODEs, PDEs, integral operators and discrete operators. These algorithms are embarrassingly parallelisable. Numerical examples will be given, demonstrating efficiency, and tackling difficult problems taken from mathematics and other fields such as chemistry and physics. A highlight is the computation of hundreds of eigenvalues of Dirac operators to machine precision and without spectral pollution.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75527' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk979' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(979)' class='star'><span class='star979'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (D504)</b> Timon Gutleb, Sparse Spectral Methods for Equilibrium Measures <span id='bitlink-902'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(902)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-902' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(902)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Sparse Spectral Methods for Equilibrium Measures</b><br />Timon Gutleb<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-214.html'>Applications & Implementations of Fast Spectral Methods - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Equilibrium measure problems appear in the continuous limit of particle swarm problems in which particle behaviour is modeled by attractive-repulsive forces. We introduce a banded spectral method using weighted Jacobi polynomials which allows the efficient computation of equilibrium measures for power law kernels. The derivation of the method involves new Jacobi polynomial recurrence relationships for Riemann-Liouville integrals, Riesz potentials and the fractional Laplacian. We present numerical experiments which agree with special case analytic results as well as independent particle swarm simulations in one and higher dimensions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75527' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk980' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(980)' class='star'><span class='star980'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (D504)</b> Ioannis P.

Many methods require a truncation of the domain to discretize. Aside from the expense, the nonlocal nature of FPDEs and the slow decay of the solutions often cause numerical artefacts to appear even with large truncations. Moreover, the solutions may exhibit singularities that must be accounted for to build methods that converge quickly.     
We discuss a class of FPDEs that include sqrt-Laplacian, derivative, Hilbert transform and identity operators. By constructing a sum space consisting of weighted Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and their Hilbert transform counterparts, we precisely identify the action of the fractional operator on our approximation space. This allows us to derive sparse relationships between the sum space that we expand our solution in, and the right-hand side which is expanded in the so-called dual sum space. Affine transformations of the sum space can be combined to together in the approximation where, remarkably, the action of the fractional operator decouples. Hence, we solve over each interval separately and in parallel.     
We apply our spectral method to problems with smooth data, where we observe spectral convergence, as well as a fractional wave propagation problem.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75527' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk981' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(981)' class='star'><span class='star981'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (D504)</b> Musawenkhosi P.

The single domain multivariate spectral collocation methods have been proven to be effective in solving time-dependent PDEs defined over small time domains. However, there is a significant loss of accuracy as time domain proliferates and also when the number of grid nodes approaches a definite particular number. Therefore, the establishment of the new innovative multi-domain multivariate spectral quasilinearisation method (MDMV-SQLM) is described for the purpose of solving (2+1) dimensional nonlinear PDEs defined on large time intervals. The main output of this study is confirmation that minimizing the size of time computational domain at each subinterval assures sufficiently accurate results that are attained using minimal number of nodal points and computational time.  To highlight the efficiency and accuracy of the MDMV-SQLM, error estimates, condition numbers and CPU time are presented for nonlinear Burger’s PDEs. The adoption of the domain decomposition technique is efficacious in suppressing the numerical challenges linked to large matrices and ill-conditioned nature of the resulting coefficient matrix. Also, the obtained results confirm that the numerical scheme is computationally cheap, fast and yield extremely accurate and stable results using fewer number of grid points for large time domains.

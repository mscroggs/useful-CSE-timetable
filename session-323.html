This initiative teaches the  software engineering practices which are needed for modern collaborative  computational research but are often missed in a traditional university  curriculum.    
Thus far, over 2000 students and researchers have been trained.  The project  currently focuses on the Nordic/Baltic countries, but aims to expand beyond  this region. CodeRefinery aims to operate as a community project with support  from academic organizations.    
In this contribution we will share our experiences and lessons learned from  developing and evolving the lesson curriculum and course format, from  organizing over 50 events and from growing a community of instructors and  research software engineers with the goal of improving software engineering  practices and thus the quality of computational research and engineering. We  will summarize which development tools and practices we have found to be  essential and offer recommendations on where to start and how to progress.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75726' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1468' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1468)' class='star'><span class='star1468'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM (D508)</b> Konrad Hinsen, Human-Computer Interaction in Open Computational Science <span id='bitlink-1350'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1350)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1350' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1350)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Human-Computer Interaction in Open Computational Science</b><br />Konrad Hinsen<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-323.html'>An Update on Software Engineering for Science</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>Two important tendencies in scientific research are the increasing  importance of computational modelling and the nascent Open Science  movement. Together, they force us to revise the way scientists and  non-scientists use computational tools and models, as all stakeholders  must be able to develop trust in these tools and models at their  respective levels of domain knowledge and engagement.    
Today's software engineering techniques, inherited from an industrial  context, focus on small development teams creating computational tools  for a large number of users that interact with the tools at a much more  abstract level. Software developers thus become gatekeepers of the  computational models that are embedded in these tools, which mere users  can neither fully understand nor safely modify. Open Science requires  reducing this epistemic opacity, allowing all stakeholders to interact  with computational models at their level of scientific rather than  technical expertise.    
A strategy that I have been exploring is moving the models out of the  tools and into the human-computer interface in the form of  specifications. The central user interface of such a future scientific  computing environment is an authoring tool for a computational medium  that can represent models. Computational tools operate on this medium,  reading models and parameters from it and adding back their results. I  will conclude my presentation with a demonstration of a prototype  implementation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75726' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1469' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1469)' class='star'><span class='star1469'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM (D508)</b> Anshu Dubey, The Pull Request Assistant <span id='bitlink-1351'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1351)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1351' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1351)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Pull Request Assistant</b><br />Anshu Dubey<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-323.html'>An Update on Software Engineering for Science</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>A healthy GitHub project changes over time. Developers fix bugs, add new features and rework code to make it more efficient. A well-run project uses a Pull Request (PR) to review changes before they are allowed into the main branch. Our experience working with PR reviewers is that they have a difficult job. Not only do they have to review code changes that are part of a PR, but also review documentation and test-cases related to those changes, which may reside in other files separate from the PR.     We are developing a Pull-Request Assistant, called MeerCat, that uses repository mining to make a reviewerâ€™s job more manageable by showing the PR author (a) potential problems with the PR they have submitted and (b) modifications they can make to address those problems. A PR author is expected to address these problems before the PR moves into formal review stage. In essence, to aid a PR reviewer, MeerCat puts the onus on the PR author to come to review with a well-thought-out set of changes.     The types of problems MeerCat currently focuses on are in the areas of documentation and testing: we aid a PR author in aligning both documentation and testing with code changes. In many cases, MeerCat can offer specific directions to bring this alignment about, including bringing missing but related files into the PR and suggesting specific modifications.     MeerCat is in beta-testing with several projects at the moment.       </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75726' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1470' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1470)' class='star'><span class='star1470'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (D508)</b> Neil P.

Software metrics are the degree to which a software system possesses some relevant property. Many software metrics are defined as quantitative measurements based on the analysis of source code. Others, such as those being developed by the CHAOSS initiative, focus on measuring the ability of a project to deliver software that meets various criteria, such as community health or development efficiency.    
A key question is how useful software metrics are in improving software quality when applied to development in computational science and engineering, which can differ from software engineering in other areas because of evolving or unclear requirements, deployment to large-scale systems and architectures, and focus on performance.     
I will consider which types of software metric might benefit researcher-developers and research software engineers working in computational science and engineering. Can useful metrics be identified by considering the differences in the way that software is developed these fields?  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75726' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

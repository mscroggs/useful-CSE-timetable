I will discuss work on two related approaches to tackle this. One is to embed local, convection-resolving high-resolution models in model columns of a global model, with two-way coupling between them. This is the approach of superparameterization, originally proposed by Grabowski and co-workers. We developed a set-up to apply superparameterization regionally (in selected model columns) rather than globally, thereby making it computationally feasible to use fully 3-d LES for the local models.  In an alternative approach we replaced the local high-res model by a computationally cheap stochastic surrogate model trained on data from the LES or from observations. A discrete Markov chain model was used to this end. We developed a method employing machine-learning assisted resampling to construct a stochastic surrogate, and tested it on the L96 model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75182' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk13' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(13)' class='star'><span class='star13'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (G108)</b> Kara D.

However, it is not clear that prognostic moments form an optimal basis set for representing microphysical processes across the range of conditions experienced in the atmosphere. In addition, microphysical parameterizations employing prognostic moments require developing closure schemes, which are known to suffer from both parametric and structural uncertainty in their representations of inherently higher dimensional cloud processes. These uncertainties limit model fidelity and lead to forecasting errors. Recently, machine learning methods have been used to develop reduced order models of various physical systems by discovering governing equations directly from high-dimensional observational data. Here we investigate how machine learning methods such as variational auto-encoders can be used to learn optimal predictors for microphysical process rates in an unsupervised manner, by simultaneously learning lower dimensional representations of droplet size distributions and predicting their dynamic evolution. We discuss how these findings could be used to either guide moment-based scheme development, or replace them with alternative formulations.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75182' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk14' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(14)' class='star'><span class='star14'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (G108)</b> Michelle Kanipe, Dynamical System Analysis of a Rich Cloud Model and Implications for Cloud Aggregation <span id='bitlink-14'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(14)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-14' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(14)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Dynamical System Analysis of a Rich Cloud Model and Implications for Cloud Aggregation</b><br />Michelle Kanipe<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-3.html'>Understanding Cloud Physics Using Stochastic, Dynamical, and Data-Driven Modeling - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Shallow-cumulus evolution and self-organization, or aggregation, into different cloud patterns is a complicated process, with many not well understood elements. To shed more light on the physical processes involved we study the dynamical behavior of a simple, one-dimensional model of warm cloud evolution, consisting of three prognostic differential equations. Cloud growth is treated as a non-linear combination of vertical motion, cloud droplet concentration, and rain droplet concentration, linked in a system of balance equations. A bifurcation analysis shows that the model has rich mathematical structure, with steady, periodic, and chaotic solutions, and we will discuss the physics and feedbacks of the underlying phases and their transitions, including the route to chaos. If time permits, we will report on a dynamical systems analysis of a two-dimensional field of coupled one-dimensional cloud models.

Stratocumulus clouds have a great effect on Earth’s energy budget because (i) they can reflect sunlight; and (ii) they cover vast amounts of our planet. It is thus important to understand and model stratocumulus clouds and in this talk, we make connections between two very different models. The first model is a large eddy simulation (LES), which is a cloud resolving 3D atmospheric simulation that is computationally expensive to run. The second model is a scalar delay differential equation (DDE), which is trivial to run and that interprets the interactions of precipitation and cloud as a predator (rain) and prey (cloud). We connect these two models by estimating parameters of the predator prey model from LES that reflect a variety of meteorological conditions. We rely on a feature-based approach to parameter estimation and numerically solve the problem using an affine invariant ensemble sampler. The result of our computations is a map of meteorological conditions to the parameter space of the predator prey model, which is needed if one were to use it to parameterize stratocumulus clouds in Earth system and climate models.

However, aerosol microphysical processes, chemistry, and transport properties are not yet fully understood and are highly parameterized, leading to uncertainty in the results of our models. Thus, we must obtain accurate aerosol models that are also predictive, particularly in a time when aerosol-emitting ships may soon traverse the polar arctic ocean and there is credible talk about climate intervention strategies like stratospheric aerosol injection. This work focuses on the transport properties of atmospheric aerosols, namely their mixing and spreading via turbulent transport in the planetary boundary layer. We propose a novel stochastic model comprised of advection and diffusion parameters, operating on distinct spatial scales, that vary according to their respective machine-learned probability distribution, parameterized to be a function of space, time, and relevant exogenic properties. The model is evaluated using ensembles of particles that advect and diffuse both deterministically and via random walks with a magnitude drawn from the corresponding learned distribution. To verify our model, we employ data sources varying across a wide range of scales from algorithmically-classified satellite imagery of ship-exhaust tracks in the Pacific to a tabletop fog chamber.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75182' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

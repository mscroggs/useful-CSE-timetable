These surface PDEs arise in many areas of science and engineering, including models of atmospheric flows, chemical signaling on cell membranes, morphogenesis, and textures for computer graphics.  MGM uses a Poisson disk sampling-type technique for coarsening the point clouds and new meshfree restriction/interpolation operators based on polyharmonic splines for transferring information between the coarsened point clouds.  These components are then combined with standard smoothing and operator coarsening methods in a V-cycle iteration.  MGM is applicable to discretizations of elliptic PDEs based on various localized meshfree methods, including RBF finite differences (RBF-FD) and generalized finite differences (GFD).  We test MGM both as a standalone solver and preconditioner for Krylov subspace methods on several test problems using RBF-FD and GFD, and numerically analyze convergence rates, efficiency, and scaling with increasing point cloud sizes.  We also perform a side-by-side comparison to algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for solving the same systems.  Finally, we further demonstrate the effectiveness of MGM by applying it to three challenging applications on complicated surfaces: pattern formation, surface harmonics, and geodesic distance.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75453' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk716' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(716)' class='star'><span class='star716'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (G104)</b> Tadej Dobravec, On Advantages of Strong-Form Local Meshless Methods for Phase-Field Modelling of Dendritic Solidification <span id='bitlink-665'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(665)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-665' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(665)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On Advantages of Strong-Form Local Meshless Methods for Phase-Field Modelling of Dendritic Solidification</b><br />Tadej Dobravec<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-158.html'>Perspectives in Modern Kernel Approximation Methods - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>The strong-form local meshless methods are applied to solve phase-field models for dendritic solidification. Dendrites, tree-like branched structures, are the most common microstructure in the solidification processing of metals. The microstructure evolution directly controls the properties of solidified material. Therefore, understanding dendritic solidification plays a crucial role in the quality assurance of the solidified product. The phase-field method represents the preferred technique for predicting dendritic microstructure under various casting conditions. The strong-form meshless methods turn out to be very suitable for solving phase-field models for dendritic growth. The solution of these models is prone to mesh-induced anisotropy, which can be in the meshless methods straightforwardly circumvented by using scattered node distributions. In the present contribution, the radial basis function generated finite difference method and the diffuse approximate method are tested on regular and scattered node distributions. The emphasis is given to the analysis of the growth in arbitrary preferential growth directions. The influence of node distribution type on the accuracy is thoroughly analysed for both methods. Additionally, a space-time adaptive algorithm developed to accelerate meshless calculations is presented. The algorithm dynamically ensures the highest density of computational nodes and the finest time-stepping at the solid-liquid interface.

We mainly focus on RBF scattered data interpolation. VSKs work quite well in cases spoiled by a considerable  instability of the standard method. They can significantly improve the recovery quality by preserving shape properties and particular features of the function underlying the given data.  We also show how a proper choice of the scaling function can be an effective tool to approximate non--smooth functions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75453' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk718' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(718)' class='star'><span class='star718'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G104)</b> Jan Glaubitz, A New Perspective on the Stability of RBF Methods for Conservation Laws <span id='bitlink-667'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(667)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-667' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(667)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A New Perspective on the Stability of RBF Methods for Conservation Laws</b><br />Jan Glaubitz<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-158.html'>Perspectives in Modern Kernel Approximation Methods - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Radial basis function methods are powerful tools in numerical analysis and have demonstrated good properties in many different simulations. However, only a few stability results are known for RBF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. In particular, when boundary conditions are included, stability issues frequently occur. We address how provable stability for RBF methods can be obtained. In particular, we discuss a new perspective on the stability of RBF methods using recent developments on summation-by-parts operators, often used in the finite difference and the finite element community.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75453' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk719' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(719)' class='star'><span class='star719'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (G104)</b> Samuel A.

A mapping function is used to provide information about the local direction of the anisotropy, with one of the global coordinates chosen to parameterize the ‘parallel’ position along the mapping in a one-to-one manner. Nodes are arranged on succesive planes of constant parallel coordinate with fine spacing on each plane necessary to represent the small-scale variations perpendicular to the mapping direction, but with large spacings then possible between these planes because of the small variation along the mapping. This greatly reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to represent highly-anisotropic fields in this space and the associated computational cost of simulations involving such fields. The use of standard unstructured finite element meshes on each plane is explored, as well as fully-meshfree arrangements. No mesh connectivity is defined between planes in either case, and field-aligned basis functions are constructed using the mapping function to extend the bases into the full domain. Integration of the bases is addressed using variationally consistent integration (VCI), and the scheme (as well as other EFG schemes) is shown to be locally conservative under certain conditions. Robust convergence of several test problems is demonstrated.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75453' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

Within a certain temperature range, NLCs behave as anisotropic liquids, with anisotropy imparted by the tendency of the long, rod-like, molecules to align locally. We consider the evolution of "nanoscale" films, of thickness around 100nm, for which van der Waals-type intermolecular interactions between the film and the substrate are important. By implementing an ADI-type numerical method within a GPU computing environment [Lam et al., Computing dynamics of thin films via large scale GPU-based simulations, J. Comp. Phys. X 2, 100001, 2019], we are able to simulate our model efficiently to describe 3D flows on large computational domains (physically, hundreds of microns across) for long times. Comparison of our results with available experimental data shows very good qualitative agreement. We also use our model to investigate the influence of the so-called "anchoring" conditions at the substrate (the preferred orientation of the NLC molecules), and show that it can affect the instability development quite strongly under certain conditions.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk975' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(975)' class='star'><span class='star975'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM (E105)</b> Demetrios Papageorgiou, On Some Novel Instabilities in Viscous Multilayer Shear Flows <span id='bitlink-899'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(899)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-899' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(899)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On Some Novel Instabilities in Viscous Multilayer Shear Flows</b><br />Demetrios Papageorgiou<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-213.html'>Recent Advances in Computations and Modeling of Thin Fluid Films - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Shear flows that are stable (e.g. Couette flow or Poiseuille flow at moderate Reynolds numbers) can become  unstable to an interfacial mode when multiple immiscible layers are present. Such instabilities are typically  long wave and were discovered about 50 years ago by Yih. The rule of thumb is that in simple shear flows  instability arises if the more viscous layer is also the thinner one, the so-called thin layer effect.  Motivated by experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we consider fluid systems that allow for  slip at fluid-fluid interfaces (slip at fluid-solid surfaces is orders of magnitude smaller and is ignored).  The basic states are viscous but support a velocity jump across interfaces. We have a viscous analogue of the  Kelvin-Helmholtz problem seen in inviscid flows, and the natural question is to analyse such slip models to  gain an understanding of their well-posedness and map out their stability characteristics. I will address  two aspects: (i) A linear theory of the general problem and a semi-analytical demonstration of short-wave instabilities   when the slip is asymptotically large; (ii) the development of a thin-layer long-wave nonlinear model and a discussion  of its stability characteristics. It will be shown that for viscosity ratios that render the no-slip flow stable, even a small  amount of slip can cause short wave instabilities of the Turing type. Nonlinear computations will be reported.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk977' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(977)' class='star'><span class='star977'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM (E105)</b> Samuel Tomlinson, Laminar Drag Reduction in Surfactant-Contaminated Superhydrophobic Channels <span id='bitlink-900'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(900)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-900' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(900)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Laminar Drag Reduction in Surfactant-Contaminated Superhydrophobic Channels</b><br />Samuel Tomlinson<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-213.html'>Recent Advances in Computations and Modeling of Thin Fluid Films - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Although superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) show promise for drag reduction (DR) applications, their performance can be compromised by traces of surfactant that accumulate at liquid-gas interfaces, generating Marangoni stresses that increase drag. This question is addressed for a three-dimensional laminar flow in a plane periodic channel with SHSs along both walls, in the presence of soluble surfactant. We consider the regime in which bulk diffusion is sufficiently strong for concentration gradients normal to the SHSs to be small. Seeking solutions that are periodic in the streamwise and spanwise directions, and exploiting a long-wave theory that accounts for rapid transverse Marangoni-driven flow and shear-dispersion effects, we thereby reduce this high-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional model for the surfactant distribution. The system exhibits multiple regimes where asymptotic solutions can be constructed, which compare favourably with numerics. Some are characterised by advection and diffusion-dominated processes, where the liquid-gas interface exhibits shear-free behaviour and the DR is at its maximum. In contrast, others are dominated by Marangoni effects, where the liquid-gas interface exhibits no-slip behaviour and the DR vanishes. This analysis provides a guide for designing surfactant-contaminated SHSs to maximise the DR for applications.

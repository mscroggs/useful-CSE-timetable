In city planning and policy-making procedures, computational models are of significant importance. High-resolution models in space and time need large-scale computations. In this talk, we are presenting the details of a simulation digital twin for the airflow and NO2 dispersion over a 3D domain of 25 km^2 ground area in the city Gyor, Hungary including building geometries.  This solution uses the in-house code Fluid-Solver that runs efficiently on CPU and GPU nodes. The algorithm is based on a flux-vector splitting finite volume scheme over unstructured tetrahedral meshes and solves the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in the second order. For model order reduction we applied the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with the snapshot matrix generated by runs for velocity inlet boundary conditions of which wind directions samples the wind rose.  Boundary conditions are obtained by wind measurement sensor data assimilation. Results are visualized in real-time by viewing images of dedicated slices at sampled time points and also in an interactive way. Some remarkable numerical properties of the reduced model simulations will be discussed as well, namely the greatly increased stability of the POD-simulations: explicit time-steppings are stable for CFL=1000 for the POD-reduced model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75888' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1847' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1847)' class='star'><span class='star1847'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (D504)</b> Huan Zhou, Study of Spatial-/Time-Varying Parameter Estimation Using Genetic Algorithm and Overlapping Sliding Window Approach <span id='bitlink-1690'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1690)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1690' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1690)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Study of Spatial-/Time-Varying Parameter Estimation Using Genetic Algorithm and Overlapping Sliding Window Approach</b><br />Huan Zhou<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-407.html'>HPC Applications for Tackling Global and Engineering Challenges Towards Exascale</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>The models created for real-life problems in the area of water resources and epidemiology often account for spatial-/time-varying input parameters to dynamically reflect variations depending on miscellaneous factors â€“ seasonal change, human interventions, location, etc. Such variations make fast and efficient calibration a challenge, reflected in two aspects: segmentation and optimization algorithm. The Overlapping Sliding Window (OSW) technique is often used to segment a massive (calibration) problem into smaller sub-problems over different time slices. The segmented calibration problems are then solved individually using an optimization algorithm. Searching for the optimal values of such parameters over a time slice can even be complicated by the dimensionality of the space due to spatial variability. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proven to remain a powerful tool for optimizing parameters when the search space is large. Thus, this study proposes a calibration approach that combines the OSW and a hybrid MPI+OpenMP version of GA to progressively refine and determine the near-optimal trajectory of spatial-/time-varying parameters. The efficiency of the proposed calibration method is evaluated by an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model featuring a region-/weekly-varying transmission rate. Results indicated that our approach leads to satisfactory calibration accuracy with a low root-mean-square error (RMSE) and achieves a considerable reduction in the computational cost over the serial counterpart on the HPC cluster    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75888' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1848' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1848)' class='star'><span class='star1848'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (D504)</b> Wojciech Szeliga, Digital Twin in Modeling of Renewable Energy Sources <span id='bitlink-1691'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1691)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1691' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1691)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Digital Twin in Modeling of Renewable Energy Sources</b><br />Wojciech Szeliga<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-407.html'>HPC Applications for Tackling Global and Engineering Challenges Towards Exascale</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Renewable energy sources are undeniably a key component of a global   transformation required for limiting anthropogenic climate changes.   While harvesting energy from wind or solar radiation has its own   limitations in terms of accessibility of the energy source, there arises   a necessity of optimization of the harvesting process. The amount of   energy that can be produced depends on the weather conditions which are   a result of complex multiscale phenomena in the atmosphere.  We present a digital twin for renewable energy sources, a comprehensive   tool named RES for modeling fine-grained weather conditions for wind and   photovoltaic farms and providing estimates of energy production. The   framework introduces a multiscale approach by using two models for   different scales: WRF and EULAG. With both models coupled, it is   possible to perform complex simulations in HPC environment, tailored   towards renewable energy sources. Great level of details significantly   increases the quality of the digital twin and its energy production   estimations done at the post-processing stage.  Described framework has been introduced to one of the largest Polish   energy operators. As the operator owns multiple wind farms, their energy   production estimation is detailed with created digital twin of each. RES   is also used by the operator to create a digital twin of energy   infrastructure in order to predict its failures due to upcoming wind   gusts, excessive temperatures or icing.

Among various types of UQ methods, the Monte Carlo (MC) method played an important role due to its simplicity and robustness. However, the large computational cost of the MC is often the main obstacle to applying MC to an engineering application. In this presentation, a new framework will be introduced which improves the efficiency of the standard UQ via the MC method. This framework employs the uncertainty intrinsic code (UIC) which extends the uncertain variables via a stochastic dimension holding their uncertainty information. With the help of UIC, the redundant operator can be eliminated and the data density can be improved simultaneously so that the execution efficiency in a high-performance computing system can be improved. According to the Numerical experiments, the new framework achieved a moderate improvement in sequential code and up to 85% efficiency improvement for the parallel code.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75888' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1850' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1850)' class='star'><span class='star1850'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM (D504)</b> Kulwinder Singh, A Study of Prediction Performances of Econometric Arima and Soft Computing Ann Models in Forecasting Black Carbon Concentration Data <span id='bitlink-1693'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1693)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1693' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1693)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Study of Prediction Performances of Econometric Arima and Soft Computing Ann Models in Forecasting Black Carbon Concentration Data</b><br />Kulwinder Singh<br />Wednesday, March 1 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-407.html'>HPC Applications for Tackling Global and Engineering Challenges Towards Exascale</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Fresh air is imminent for life and to thrive on this planet. However, this vital component of life is ill-effected by fast-paced industrialization, urbanization, automobiles, factories and coal-based thermal power generation as over the years these have jeopardized the air quality index. Due to hazardous impact of black carbon on the environment as well as human health, researchers have turned their attention towards its study. The comparative analysis of artificial neural network and econometric models used to predict the time series of monthly observations of black carbon emissions from three major coal mines located at Bokaro, Jharia and Raniganj in India. These coal mines have large emissions of particulate matter ( ) that contribute significantly to pollution levels. A multilayer perceptron feedforward artificial neural network is used to predict the black carbon concentration data from these three coal mines. The neural network is trained using a Bayesian regularization backpropagation algorithm. The efficiency of neural network models is evaluated by mean absolute deviation (MAD), root mean square (RMSE), and coefficient of determination ( ) values. The results obtained are then compared with the well-known and widely used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The results of the study reveal the effective performance of artificial neural networks over the ARIMA model in forecasting black carbon concentration data.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75888' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

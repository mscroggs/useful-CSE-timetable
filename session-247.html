A novel data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) algorithm is presented that computes optimal and safe control policies using real-time feedback driving the unknown system along a desired trajectory while satisfying system constraints. Using a finite number of data samples from the unknown system, our proposed algorithm uses a behavioral systems theory approach to learn a non-parametric system model used to predict future trajectories. We show that, in the case of deterministic linear time-invariant systems, the DeePC algorithm is equivalent to the widely adopted Model Predictive Control (MPC), but it generally outperforms subsequent system identification and model-based control. To cope with nonlinear and stochastic systems, we propose salient regularizations to the DeePC algorithm. Using techniques from (distributionally) robust stochastic optimization, we prove that these regularization indeed robustify DeePC against corrupted data. We illustrate our results with nonlinear and noisy simulations and experiments from power electronics and power systems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75573' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1124' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1124)' class='star'><span class='star1124'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (E102)</b> Guanru Pan, Data-Driven Predictive Control with Stochastic Uncertainties <span id='bitlink-1038'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1038)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1038' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1038)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data-Driven Predictive Control with Stochastic Uncertainties</b><br />Guanru Pan<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-247.html'>Recent Advances in Data-Driven Control of Complex Systems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>Commonly, Model Predictive Control (MPC)---which is also called receding-horizon control---is based on the repeated solution of an optimal control problem. As such MPC usually relies on model of underlying dynamics. However, there is rapidly growing line of research which replaces the model with data-driven system descriptions. Of particular interest are methods which can work with output-data only. So far most of the research on data-driven predictive control has focused on noisy measurement data but not on the consideration of stochastic disturbances. In this talk, we discuss data-driven predictive control with stochastic uncertainties. We show how a tailored variant of the ubiquitous fundamental lemma in combination with polynomial chaos expansions enables data-driven output-feedback stochastic predictive control. We present sufficient stability conditions and we draw upon numerical examples to illustrate our findings.

This requires mathematical research in both, modeling and control. In this presentation, we focus on a path  planning task for a multi-tube cannula as it could be used in deep-brain neurosurgery. A system model derived by first principles has to be refined by data-based approaches. Improving the accuracy of the tool tip position, a data-based iterative control scheme is applied.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75573' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1126' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1126)' class='star'><span class='star1126'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (E102)</b> Sebastian Peitz, Distributed Control of Partial Differential Equations Using Convolutional Reinforcement Learning <span id='bitlink-1040'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1040)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1040' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1040)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Distributed Control of Partial Differential Equations Using Convolutional Reinforcement Learning</b><br />Sebastian Peitz<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-247.html'>Recent Advances in Data-Driven Control of Complex Systems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>We present a convolutional framework which significantly reduces the complexity and thus, the computational effort for distributed reinforcement learning control of partial differential equations (PDEs). Exploiting translational invariances, the high-dimensional distributed control problem can be transformed into a multi-agent control problem with many identical agents. Furthermore, using the fact that information is transported with finite velocity in many cases, the dimension of the agents' environment can be drastically reduced using a convolution operation over the state space of the PDE. In this setting, the complexity can be flexibly adjusted via the kernel width or using a stride greater than one. A central question in this framework is the definition of the reward function, which may consist of both local and global contributions. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework using several standard PDE examples with increasing complexity, where stabilization is achieved by training a low-dimensional DDPG agent with small training effort.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75573' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1127' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1127)' class='star'><span class='star1127'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM (E102)</b> Jamiree M.

The mathematical models for  the genetic toggle switch that currently exist have been useful in describing circuit dynamics in  rapidly dividing cells, assuming fixed or time-invariant kinetic rates.   As cells transition from one growth phase to another, kinetic rates can be modeled with time-varying parameters.  We propose a novel class of parameter varying nonlinear models to capture the dynamics of genetic circuits, including the toggle switch, as they transition from different phases of growth. We show that there exists unique solutions for this class of systems.    We show that the domain of these systems, which is the positive orthant, is positively invariant. We showcase a theoretical control strategy for these systems that would grant asymptotic monostability of a desired fixed point. We then take the general form of these systems and analyze their stability properties through the framework of time-varying Koopman operator theory. A necessary condition for asymptotic stability is also provided as well as a sufficient condition for instability. Furthermore, we use real data from a genetic toggle switch which contains a hybrid promoter to validate the models using an algorithm which constructs time varying parameters to model the toggle switch's behavior.

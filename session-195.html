The model requires a reduced number of parameters with respect to commonly used transport models. A single carrier with negative charge is considered. The polarization curves are empirically modeled by a power law to account for transport assisted by shallow traps. A simplified model for deep traps with Gaussian distribution of the density of states is proposed to describe the depolarization curves.   Numerical methods for solving the model equations and for fitting its parameters to measurement data are discussed.  The validity of the model is confirmed by excellent agreement with experiments.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75501' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk890' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(890)' class='star'><span class='star890'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM (G107)</b> Antonio Fern&#225;ndez Caballero, Ripples in Free Standing Graphene <span id='bitlink-818'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(818)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-818' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(818)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Ripples in Free Standing Graphene</b><br />Antonio Fern&#225;ndez Caballero<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-195.html'>Mathematical Problems and Simulations in the Applications of Transport Theory - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Suspended graphene sheets are covered with ripples of size ranging from 5 to 10 nm and about 1 nm height believed to be generated by coupling between the bending modes of the sheet and electronic density. We present an atomistic model to calculate the free energy that combines a quantum tight-binding Hamiltonian of electrons in a honeycomb lattice coupled to a classical nonlinear elasticity theory of von Kármán plates at finite temperature. The strength $g$ of the electron-phonon coupling controls a transition from a stable flat configuration of the sheet to a stable rippled phase. We use a scaling procedure that allows us to effectively reach larger sheet sizes. By numerically solving the model for different size scaling, $k$, we find the critical value of the parameter, $g_c$, and the stable configuration of graphene. For any value of $k$, renormalized elastic constants produce a critical coupling, $g_c(T,k)$, which is a decreasing function of temperature. As the sheet size measured by $k$ tends to infinity, $g_c(T,k)$ decreases to a limiting value, $g_c(T)$, approximately as $k^{0.5}$. In this limit, rippling is a second order phase transition with a susceptibility that scales as $\vert g_c(T,k)-g_c(T)\vert ^{-\gamma}$, with critical exponent $\gamma$ close to 0.25.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75501' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk891' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(891)' class='star'><span class='star891'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM (G107)</b> Vittorio Romano, Charge Transport in Graphene and Application to GFETs <span id='bitlink-819'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(819)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-819' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(819)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Charge Transport in Graphene and Application to GFETs</b><br />Vittorio Romano<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-195.html'>Mathematical Problems and Simulations in the Applications of Transport Theory - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Device engineers devote considerable effort for developing transistor designs in which short-channel effects are suppressed and series resistances are minimized. Scaling theory predicts that a field effect transistor (FET) with a thin barrier and a thin gate-controlled region will be robust against short-channel effects down to very short gate lengths. The possibility of having channels that are just one atomic layer thick is perhaps the most attractive feature of graphene for its use in transistors.    
Main drawbacks of a large-area monolayer graphene are the  zero gap and, for graphene on substrate, the degradation of the mobility [G. Nastasi, V. Romano, A full coupled drift-diffusion-Poisson simulation of a GFET, Commun. Nonlinear Sci. Numer. Simulat., Vol. 87 (2020), 105300]. In [G. Nastasi and V. Romano, An efficient GFET structure, IEEE Transaction on  Electron Devices 68 (9) 2021, 4729] the authors propose a new geometry which seems very promising to get an efficient Graphene Field Effect Transistor (GFET). The simulations are based on a degenerate drift-diffusion model.  Here the same GFET is simulated by directly solving the semiclassical Boltzmann equation by using a Discontinuous Galerkin approach.

Nevertheless, being a gapless conductor in its pristine form, it cannot be used for modeling Field Effect Transistors (FET), consequently other solutions have to be investigated to overcome the problem. A solution is the use of graphene nano-ribbons  which exhibit a band gap inversely proportional to the width of the strip, another solution is offered by the use of bilayer graphene where a tunable band gap can be induced by applying an electric field.    Here we propose a preliminary study for a FET, with graphene bilayer in the active area, by using a Monte Carlo simulation.

Within many of these molecular systems, there is a natural time-scale separation present between the fast (microscopic) dynamics, and the slowly changing global conformation of the molecule determined by a few (macroscopic) variables.    
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a general sampling algorithm that has been designed for sampling from probability distributions determined by a potential energy function. The objective is to construct a stochastic process whose time-invariant distribution is the invariant distribution of the molecular system By ergodicity, we can record samples from a single path of the process, and then these samples are consistent with invariant distribution. However, when the underlying system has a medium to large time-scale separation, the MCMC method may remain stuck in one of the local minima of the potential energy function, prohibiting a swift exploration of the complete state space of the molecular system.    
In my talk, I will present a new micro-macro MCMC method (mM-MCMC) in which we first sample from the macroscopic variables, before reconstructing a new molecular instance that is consistent with the macroscopic value. I will give a detailed explanation of the algorithm, and show its efficiency on two molecular examples if time permits.  	    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75501' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

The former has been changing over the past 30 years, especially with increasing power of computing centers, while the later was largely untouched and still provides rather worse case scenarios (pessimistic estimates). In this talk, I present my work on accuracy and reproducibility assuring strategies for parallel iterative solvers that may not hold due to the non-associativity of floating-point operations; these strategies primarily rely on guarding every bit of resulting computation until the final rounding, hence they can be costly. Driven by the energy consumption constraint for computing centers and, hence, computations, scientists began a revision of applications, algorithms, as well as the underlying working / storage precision. The main aim is to make the computing cost sustainable and apply the lagom principle, especially when it comes to precision but also to the error estimates. Hence, I will also present preliminary results on probabilistic (aka optimistic) error analysis that closely captures the actual accumulated error.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75549' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1036' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1036)' class='star'><span class='star1036'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D304)</b> Marc Casas, Trade-Offs between Performance, Energy, and Accuracy of Non-Standard Computer Number Formats <span id='bitlink-954'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(954)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-954' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(954)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Trade-Offs between Performance, Energy, and Accuracy of Non-Standard Computer Number Formats</b><br />Marc Casas<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-227.html'>Sustainable Computing with the Help of Tools, Mixed-Precision, and Optimistic Error Estimates</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>Computer number formats like Posits or BFloat16 constitute alternative approaches to the IEEE floating-point standard that can potentially achieve reductions in terms of memory storage, bandwidth, and compute costs. Indeed, hardware vendors have incorporated half-precision data formats and have implemented mixed-precision (MP) instructions. This talk will discuss the advantages and limitations of these alternative formats with respect to the IEEE standard in terms of trade-offs between performance, energy, and accuracy.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75549' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1037' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1037)' class='star'><span class='star1037'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:50 AM (D304)</b> Pablo De Oliveira Castro, Verificarlo: Tuning and Debugging Floating-Point Computations Through Stochastic Rounding <span id='bitlink-955'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(955)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-955' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(955)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Verificarlo: Tuning and Debugging Floating-Point Computations Through Stochastic Rounding</b><br />Pablo De Oliveira Castro<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:50 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-227.html'>Sustainable Computing with the Help of Tools, Mixed-Precision, and Optimistic Error Estimates</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>Reducing the cost, both in time and energy, of computer simulations is  critical. The numerical precision of simulations should be sufficient to  provide scientific insights but as low as possible to save energy and  computation time.    
We discuss the design of verificarlo  (\url{https://github.com/verificarlo/verificarlo}), an open-source framework to  verify and optimize numerical accuracy in complex programs.  Verificarlo is a  compiler tool built upon the LLVM infrastructure.  It includes  different floating-point backends simulating the effect of numerical errors and  the impact of using lower precision.    
Before lowering precision, one must ensure that the simulation is numerically  correct. In Verificarlo, we rely on alternative floating-point models, such as  Stochastic Rounding, to pinpoint numerical bugs in simulation codes. A  probabilistic definition of the number of significant digits allows us to  estimate the accuracy of a computation.    
Verificarlo can then explore the compromise between precision and performance  through its variable precision backend that simulates lower precisions on  software. It can identify the parts of the code that benefit from smaller  floating-point formats.    
Verificarlo has been applied in HPC codes such as neuroimaging pipelines,  DFT quantum mechanical modeling, or structure  simulations. In particular, we show how Verificarlo was used to optimize  the speed and energy consumption of a deflated conjugate-gradient solver.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75549' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1038' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1038)' class='star'><span class='star1038'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:55 AM&ndash;11:10 AM (D304)</b> David Defour, Interflop: a Project for Interoperable Tools for Computing, Debugging, Validation and Optimization of Floating-Point Programs <span id='bitlink-956'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(956)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-956' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(956)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Interflop: a Project for Interoperable Tools for Computing, Debugging, Validation and Optimization of Floating-Point Programs</b><br />David Defour<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:55 AM&ndash;11:10 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-227.html'>Sustainable Computing with the Help of Tools, Mixed-Precision, and Optimistic Error Estimates</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>The InterFLOP project aims at providing a modular and scalable platform to both analyze and control the costs of floating-point behavior of today's real programs facing those new paradigms (bigger problems, new architectures, new representation formats). The results of existing tools often generate new questions such as: Is this small error guaranteed? May this numerical error occur and how to reduce it? Some more costly analyses bring pieces of answers to these questions, but also require more expertise. In InterFLOP, we propose new analyses and combinations of existing ones to address the challenge of providing a quick and precise numerical diagnosis requiring little user expertise. For that, InterFLOP will collect and combine information on numerical instabilities, catastrophic cancellations, unstable tests, build various statistical analyses of program executions at minimal overhead.    
In this talk, we will describe advances made within the InterFLOP project which aims at 1) enlarging the class of possible applications by considering new front-ends and, therefore, new analyses; 2) providing finer numerical analyses based on formalized composite analyses; 3) verifying the accuracy in the context of precision auto-tuning to make applications more efficient and robust; 4) building statistical analyses tools and help the developer interpret the numerical behavior of program through graphical interpretation.

<h2>Data-Driven Mathematical Models for Traffic Flow - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk951' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(951)' class='star'><span class='star951'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (D508)</b> Mauro Garavello, Macroscopic Traffic Models and Autonomous Vehicles <span id='bitlink-875'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(875)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-875' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(875)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Macroscopic Traffic Models and Autonomous Vehicles</b><br />Mauro Garavello<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-208.html'>Data-Driven Mathematical Models for Traffic Flow - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>We present two models for controlling car traffic through  special vehicles, like autonomous ones. Car traffic is  described by macroscopic models, while the dynamics of the special  vehicles is described by a microscopic one. More precisely, either  the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model~\cite{LW, R}  or, alternative, the Colombo-Marcellini-Rascle (CMR) model~\cite{CMR}  describes the evolution of traffic in a road.  Assume that a vehicle, whose position  is described by the function $y(t)$, aims at controlling the  behavior of traffic. The evolution of such a vehicle is described by  the ODE $\dot y(t)=u(t)$ where $u(t)$ is a control function,  which selects the desired speed.    
Following the ideas proposed  in~\cite{DMG}, we consider two control models, one based on the LWR  model and one on the CMR model, where  the control acts on the autonomous vehicle.  We discuss about the concepts of  solutions for the two systems and we show that, given a control  function $u=u(t)$ with finite total variation, a solution exists for  both systems. The proofs are based on the wave-front tracking  technique.    
These are joint works with P. Goatin, T. Liard, F. Marcellini, and B. Piccoli.

In this work, we study the optimal control of AVs in mixed-autonomy traffic with the objective of smoothing unstable traffic flows. We first model the dynamics of a mixed-autonomy system where the acceleration of human-driven vehicles is governed by a car-following model, and the acceleration of AVs is to be controlled. This is realized as a system of first-order ODEs. We then formulate the optimal control problem and show the well-posedness of the system dynamics for a reasonable set of admissible controls and establish the existence of minimizers. Given this problem setup, we devise an approach for solving the optimal control problem based on Pontryaginâ€™s maximum principle (PMP) and the adjoint method. Further, we propose to approximate the optimal controller using a set of parametrized basis functions. Their parameters are tuned by optimizing an objective function that involves the original objective of the optimal control problem over a distribution of trajectories. Through this approach, we aim to develop a feedback control scheme based on our open-loop optimal control problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches on real-world trajectories data collected from the I-24 in Tennessee, United States.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75519' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk953' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(953)' class='star'><span class='star953'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D508)</b> Jan Friedrich, Aspects of Nonlocal Traffic Flow Modeling <span id='bitlink-877'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(877)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-877' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(877)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Aspects of Nonlocal Traffic Flow Modeling</b><br />Jan Friedrich<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-208.html'>Data-Driven Mathematical Models for Traffic Flow - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>The technological progress in autonomous driving brings new challenges for the modeling of traffic flow and extensions of classical approaches, such as the LWR or ARZ model, are needed in order to manage these.  As autonomous cars posses more data about the surrounding traffic, there is a need that traffic models incorporate those.  Therefore, nonlocal traffic flow models can be considered.  They include more information in a certain nonlocal range about the traffic of the road.  In case of non-autonomous drivers, the nonlocal range can stand for the sight of a human driver.  Moreover, this nonlocal range can be interpreted as the connection radius of autonomous cars.    
In this talk we will give an overview on nonlocal traffic flow models and discuss the challenges which arise when comparing these models to real traffic data.

In recent years, machine learning came into play in order to analyze traffic data, trying to discover patterns and substitute, when possible, traditional models. Hybrid approaches like the one based on physics-informed neural networks were also proposed.  In this talk we focus on a road segment where traffic flux is continuously counted by means of some fixed sensors. The idea is to couple machine learning and differential models, putting the former at the service of the latter. More precisely, we use a neural network to predict sensor data at the inflow boundary of the road, where the model expects information about the next-to-come traffic flow. Moreover, we use a neural network to detect congestion formations near the sensors. This information is used to recover the car density by inverting the (noninjective) fundamental diagram.  Some examples motivated by real scenarios will be discussed. Real data are provided by the Italian company Autovie Venete S.p.A.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75519' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk955' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(955)' class='star'><span class='star955'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (D508)</b> Mathis J.

Moreover, exploration and accuracy in the UQ space are all the more difficult to reach when more than 2 uncertain variables and functional outputs are considered, as is the case for instance when constructing atmospheric pollution maps. Traditionally, such UQ analyses are carried out using proper orthogonal decomposition with gaussian processes to emulate the coefficients of a truncated Karhunen-Loeve decomposition (POD-GP). This method is used in this work to carry out a global sensitivity analysis for a realistic high-dimensional traffic-related atmospheric pollutant dispersion CFD study with up to 5 uncertain variables. The pollutant dipsersion is modelled with the open-source OpenLB lattice-Boltzmann CFD code, coupled with the SUMO microscale traffic simulator and a physical engine emissions model. We also compare the POD-GP method with another metamodeling strategy based on an anchored-ANOVA decomposition of the quantity of interest, which was designed to reduce the number of required samples in the UQ space for a given accuracy.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75519' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

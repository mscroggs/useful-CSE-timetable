We discuss the approach in the setting of Stokes flow. It is based on classical topology optimization and phase field approaches, and introduces a different way to relax the underlying infinite-dimensional mixed integer problem.   We compare the novel approach to state-of-the-art density based and phase field approaches, and approaches based on the topological derivative.  Moreover, we give a theoretically founded choice of the relaxed problems. The density is modeled on a space that allows for jumps along hypersurfaces, such as BV or fractional order Sobolev spaces. Degrees of freedoms in modeling the optimization problem are chosen based on theoretical considerations, i.e., by discussing the arising optimization problems concerning existence, differentiability and convergence towards solutions of the unrelaxed problem.   We present some numerical results.  Moreover, in order to show the potential of the new approach we do a comparison to a classical approach.

This phenomena reduces the skin friction of the overlying fluid and has been shown to delay laminar-turbulent transition. Research into the macroscopic layout of SHSs as a means of passive flow control, however, remains relatively under investigated.    
Here, topology optimization is used to design an inhomogeneous SHS that can further delay spatially developing modal transition in channel flows; a highly non-linear and non-convex optimization problem. The influence of the SHS is modelled using a spatially varying slip length on the walls, forming a 2D  optimization domain.  The spectral element solver Nek5000 is used to first establish a steady baseflow in a wall-bounded channel, and then conduct unsteady direct numerical simulations of the transition to turbulence. The optimization procedure uses the adjoint-variable method to compute sensitivities and uses a checkpointing strategy to overcome the data storage requirements of the unsteady adjoint simulation. This methodology has been successfully applied to produce a surfaces that moves the transition location 29% further downstream when compared to a homogeneous counterpart by inhibiting the growth of secondary instability modes.

By designing them for low supply temperatures, the potential of renewables and waste heat can be fully exploited. The high investment costs, however, hamper their wide implementation. Over the last decades, several attempts have been made to directly optimize the network topology for maximal return on investment. Most of these studies successfully apply mixed-integer linear or nonlinear programming methods to decide on the optimal piping connections in the network. However, while the linear methods are limited in applicability, the nonlinear methods suffer from an exponential computational cost scaling with the network size.     
In this contribution, we present how adjoint-based topology optimization methods can be adopted for the topology optimization of district heating networks. We describe the key steps to adapt density-based topology optimization methods to achieve discrete solutions for the diameters of the heating pipes. Using an augmented Lagrangian method, large amounts of engineering constraints are efficiently accounted for in the design. Moreover, a benchmark with a mixed-integer nonlinear programming method confirms the advantageous scaling of the presented topology optimization method. Thus, we are able to showcase first topology optimization results for large-scale district heating networks.

Specifically, we consider the heat equation in a domain which might change over time. We compute Hadamard’s shape gradient in case of both, domain integrals and boundary integrals. As particular examples, we consider the one-phase Stefan problem and the detection of a time-dependent inclusion. We discuss the numerical solution of these problems and present respective results.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75782' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

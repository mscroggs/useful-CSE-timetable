However, for problems with slowly decaying Kolmogorov-n-widths such as certain transport-dominated problems, classical linear-subspace reduced order models (ROMs) of low dimension might yield inaccurate results. Thus, the reduced space needs to be extended to more general nonlinear manifolds. Moreover, as we are dealing with Hamiltonian systems, it is crucial that the underlying symplectic structure is preserved in the reduced model.     
To the best of our knowledge, existing literatures addresses either model reduction on manifolds or symplectic model reduction for Hamiltonian systems, but not their combination. In this talk, we bridge these two approaches by providing a novel projection technique called symplectic manifold Galerkin, which projects the Hamiltonian system onto a nonlinear symplectic trial manifold such that the ROM is again a Hamiltonian system. We provide numerical results which demonstrate the ability of the method to outperform linear-subspace ROMs.  high-level commands.

This class of problems is challenging for model reduction techniques due to the presence of nonlinear terms in the equations and also due to the presence of parameter-dependent sharp gradient regions that cannot be adequately represented through linear approximation spaces. Our approach builds on the following ingredients: (i) a general (i.e., independent of the underlying equation) registration procedure for the computation of a parametric mapping that tracks moving features of the solution field; (ii) an hyper-reduced least-squares Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order model for the rapid and reliable estimation of the solution field; (iii) a greedy procedure driven by a residual-based error indicator for efficient exploration of the parameter domain; and (iv) an adaptive mesh refinement technique for the definition of an accurate discretization for all parameter values. We present results for a representative nonlinear problem in steady aerodynamics to demonstrate the effectiveness and the mathematical soundness of our proposal.

Methods such as the multi-fidelity ensemble Kalman filter (MFEnKF) and the multi-level ensemble Kalman filter (MLEnKF) have been developed and implemented in several papers and are recognized as state-of-the-art techniques. However, the construction of low-fidelity models in the offline stage, prior to solving the data assimilation problem, leads these methods into a trade-off between the accuracy and computational cost of the approximate models. In this work, we investigate the use of adaptive reduced-basis techniques in which the approximation space is modified (but not retrained) online based on the information extracted from the full-order solutions. This has the potential to simultaneously ensure good accuracy and low cost for the employed models and thus improve the performance of the multi-fidelity/multi-level methods.

Such numerical computations for multiple parameters are computationally expensive. A suitable approach to tackle such problems is model order reduction (MOR), where we solve the problem in an appropriate subspace of the high-dimensional discretization space. Standard MOR methods generally exhibit several issues for wave-type problems, including reducibility and potentially weak stability.    
We present a goal-oriented MOR approach for wave-type problems with band-limited output of interests (e.g., in seismology) or damping (e.g., in structural health monitoring). The proposed method combines numerical Laplace inversion within the Greedy algorithm to identify a parameter with the worst reduced basis (RB) approximation. A POD-based compression is then used in the frequency domain to iteratively enrich the RB space, where we exploit band-limited functions to limit high frequencies and guarantee rapid convergence of the RB approximation. We also present a goal-oriented error estimator, targeting construction of the RB space to the output of interest. The proposed approach yields an amenable reduction and preserves the accuracy of the RB approximation in both the time and frequency domains. We also present supporting numerical results for the 2D parametric seismic wave equation with semi-realistic data functions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75252' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk165' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(165)' class='star'><span class='star165'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM (G106)</b> Pascal Den Boef, Reduced-Order Modeling Using Hybrid Operator Inference for Nonlinear Thermo-Mechanics <span id='bitlink-157'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(157)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-157' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(157)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reduced-Order Modeling Using Hybrid Operator Inference for Nonlinear Thermo-Mechanics</b><br />Pascal Den Boef<br />Wednesday, March 1 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-36.html'>Model Order Reduction in Space and Time: Challenges and Opportunities - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Simulating large-scale nonlinear thermo-mechanics systems is crucial in many industrial problems. Hence, compact modeling is required. However, many challenges arise when dealing with nonlinearities. Typically, commercial FEM code does not allow the user to extract the operators describing the dynamics. Instead, only solution trajectories are available. As a result, nonlinear model reduction is often achieved using data-driven techniques. However, complex physical characteristics are usually not preserved with solely data-based approaches. Therefore, in this work a hybrid operator inference-based approach is proposed which combines both physics-based and data-based techniques. With this approach, it is demonstrated how nonlinear material properties of thermo-mechanical systems can be efficiently reproduced in a reduced-order model.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75252' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

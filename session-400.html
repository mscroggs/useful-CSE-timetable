<h2>Exascale Software and Algorithms for High-Order PDE Solvers - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1816' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1816)' class='star'><span class='star1816'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM (E104)</b> Martin Kronbichler, Performance Optimizations of High-Order Matrix-Free Algorithms for CPU Architectures <span id='bitlink-1662'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1662)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1662' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1662)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Performance Optimizations of High-Order Matrix-Free Algorithms for CPU Architectures</b><br />Martin Kronbichler<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-400.html'>Exascale Software and Algorithms for High-Order PDE Solvers - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>My talk will present efficient algorithms for high-order finite element and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations on CPU architectures, which are implemented in the deal.II finite element library. The core algorithm is the matrix-free evaluation of the discretized partial discretization, computing the cell and face integrals of high order continuous and discontinuous finite elements on general curved meshes on the fly with sum-factorization techniques. I will contrast the algorithm selection for achieving a high throughput on GPUs and CPUs, with a focus on the latter in terms of SIMD vectorization and cache behavior. As modern implementations involve an arithmetic intensity of one to five Flop/byte, the most pressing limit is the memory bandwidth. I will present available options to reduce the memory access and increase data locality, such as computation of metric terms on the fly and the fusion of vector operations into the operator evaluation. The performance will be assessed in the context of multigrid algorithms with point-Jacobi and fast-diagonalization smoothers as well as iterative solvers with simple preconditions. These node-level optimizations will then be evaluated in terms of their strong-scaling efficiency on supercomputer scale, with a particular focus on implicit time stepping with stage-parallel Runge-Kutta methods.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75879' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1817' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1817)' class='star'><span class='star1817'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (E104)</b> Chris Cantwell, Nektar++: Re-Design of a Spectral/HP Element Solver for Streaming and Vectorized Architectures <span id='bitlink-1663'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1663)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1663' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1663)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Nektar++: Re-Design of a Spectral/HP Element Solver for Streaming and Vectorized Architectures</b><br />Chris Cantwell<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-400.html'>Exascale Software and Algorithms for High-Order PDE Solvers - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>The software design ethos of Nektar++ mimics the mathematical construction of the spectral/hp element method. This involves a hierarchy of libraries that: i) represent polynomial expansions in a standardised element, ii) a map from a standard to a local element and iii) a library which contained geometric properties for integration and differentiation in the local element.  To construct a piecewise expansion over a domain of multiple local elements we then built a library of multiple local expansions which contains  connectivity information for a CG or DG scalar field. We also chose to hold the local expansion coefficients and operators such as differentiation and integration over the whole computational domain in this last library.    
We are currently revisiting this library structure since it is not appropriate on modern streaming architectures such as GPUs. A necessary step of our re-design is to remove the underlying operators and scalar field storage from the top level library level. Our new design is essentially inverting the current top level concept so that the operators hold the necessary expansion information about connectivity and is passed a storage field that contains multiple scalar fields in different layouts depending on the target architecture. In this presentation we discuss our strategy to take our legacy code, maintain backwards compatibility for our current users whilst evolving this new structure for efficient use of GPUs and vectorised CPUs.

There are numerous challenges faced by users in adapting their code, algorithms and workflow in preparation for future exascale systems. Looking at state of the art pre-exascale systems in the U.S., we can see that these systems increasingly use accelerators or General Purpose Graphic Processing Units (GPGPUs). Developing scalable algorithms and implementing them efficiently on these systems is a challenging task, partly due to complicated memory hierarchies of GPGPUs and the complexity of programming models involved. With exascale computers reaching large number of processors, users also have to pay extra attention to how to decompose their problem and communicate efficiently among different processors in these distributed memory parallel computers. In this talk, we go through the challenges faced when porting spectral element codes to efficiently utilize leadership class computing systems in preparation for exascale machine and how we manage to solve them for exascale and beyond.

FWI is used mainly for imaging the earth's subdomains, but also has applications in noninvasive neuroimaging and high-resolution ultrasound breast imaging. The 3D FWI is an inverse approach that requires several iterations of costly acoustic or elastic wave propagations and gradient calculations. Here we describe an open-source FWI software implementation, based on the Firedrake Framework, that runs on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes and employs higher-order mass lumped elements, and we compare its performance with high-order spectral element methods on quadrilateral and hexahedron structured meshes. For the unstructured mesh, we reduce degrees of freedom based on an automatic mesh refinement that adapts to subsurface material heterogeneity. We illustrate our results of FWI on different realistic geophysical examples while discussing computational performance on different computer architectures.    
This research was carried out in association with the ongoing R&D project registered as ANP 20714-2, “Software technologies for modeling and inversion, with applications in seismic imaging” (University of Sao Paulo / Shell Brasil / ANP).    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75879' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

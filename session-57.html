An emerging tool to efficiently reduce computational costs and memory footprint in such settings is dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), which evolves the solution on a low-rank manifold. Since this manifold can exhibit a high curvature, time integrators for DLRA need to be carefully constructed to guarantee a robust error bound while preserving crucial properties of the original problem.    
This talk discusses a novel rank-adaptive and fully parallel DLRA time integrator. The integrator shares the robust error bound of the projector--splitting and the unconventional integrator while allowing basis functions and coefficients to be updated in parallel. Moreover, it allows for rank adaptivity while not requiring the potentially expensive augmented Galerkin step of the rank-adaptive unconventional integrator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrator for various radiation transport problems including radiation therapy.    
The presented results have been developed in cooperation with Gianluca Ceruti and Christian Lubich.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75291' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk259' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(259)' class='star'><span class='star259'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM (G110)</b> Yanyan Shi, A Large-Stepsize Integrator for Charged-Particle Dynamics in a Strong Magnetic Field <span id='bitlink-241'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(241)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-241' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(241)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Large-Stepsize Integrator for Charged-Particle Dynamics in a Strong Magnetic Field</b><br />Yanyan Shi<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-57.html'>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Xiao and Qin [Computer Physics Comm., 265:107981, 2021] recently proposed a remarkably simple modification of the Boris algorithm to compute the guiding centre of the highly oscillatory motion of a charged particle with step sizes that are much larger than the period of gyrorotations. They gave strong numerical evidence but no error analysis. In this talk, we provide an analysis of the large-stepsize modified Boris method in a setting that has a strong non-uniform magnetic field and moderately bounded velocities, considered over a fixed finite time interval. The error analysis is based on comparing the modulated Fourier expansions of the exact and numerical solutions, for which the differential equations of the dominant terms are derived explicitly. Numerical experiments illustrate and complement the theoretical results.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75291' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk260' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(260)' class='star'><span class='star260'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM (G110)</b> Matthias Schlottbom, On Low-Rank Tensor Product Approximations for the Stationary Radiative Transfer Equation <span id='bitlink-242'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(242)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-242' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(242)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On Low-Rank Tensor Product Approximations for the Stationary Radiative Transfer Equation</b><br />Matthias Schlottbom<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-57.html'>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>In this talk we are going to present a low-rank tensor product framework for the approximation of the stationary radiative transfer equation. Classical numerical schemes in radiative transfer, such as truncated spherical harmonics expansions combined with finite element approximations, are based on the tensor product structure of the underlying phase-space. While the tensor product structure allows to efficiently store the discretization of the differential operator, storage of the solution vector and its numerical computation becomes prohibitive already for moderately refined meshes - even if solvers with optimal computational complexity are employed.  In this talk, we present an efficient computational approach that is based on a low-rank tensor product representation of the solution vector. Based on an appropriate variational formulation, we approximate the radiative transfer equation using a Galerkin method, for which the discrete differential operator is a short-sum of Kronecker products. In such a setting, the application of the discrete differential operator to low-rank tensors can be realized efficiently. Based on this observation, we discuss the iterative construction of a low-rank approximation to the solution vector by a preconditioned Richardson iteration with rank control, which has previously been used in the context of high-dimensional elliptic equations. A key feature of our approach is the construction of a suitable preconditioner that can be applied efficiently to low-rank tensor. As an important consequence, we can devise a rank truncation strategy in the norm of the Hilbert space of the underlying variational formulation. We prove convergence of the resulting iterative scheme and that the iterates are of quasi-optimal rank.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75291' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk261' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(261)' class='star'><span class='star261'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (G110)</b> Ethan Smith, Variable Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Model Order Reduction in Multiscale Particle Transport Problems <span id='bitlink-243'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(243)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-243' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(243)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Variable Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Model Order Reduction in Multiscale Particle Transport Problems</b><br />Ethan Smith<br />Thursday, March 2 5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-57.html'>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Variable Dynamic Mode Decomposition (V-DMD), a method for calculating time eigenvalues which does not require a constant time step, is demonstrated as a method for model order reduction in multi-scale problems. V-DMD is shown to be accurate for computing time eigenvalues in systems that were intractable for DMD due to the presence of a large separation of relevant time scales. Time eigenvalues of an infinite medium neutron transport problem with delayed neutrons, and consequently several time scales, are found with V-DMD. Lastly,  V-DMD is demonstrated to calculate time eigenvalues with accuracy very similar to the typical DMD approach in systems where that typical approach can be used.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75291' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

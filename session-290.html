Because of the many wrappers and variants, a user can use the high performance library from almost any programming language. However, the package itself is still written in Fortran.    
Even Fortran enthousiasts must admit that it is less than ideal for writing a large software package. Instead of being another wrapper, T-LAPACK aims to be a complete rewrite of LAPACK in c++ using templates. C++ has major advantages over Fortran. Firstly, routines no longer need to be replicated to support different argument types. This eliminates a major source of bugs and inconsistencies. Secondly, there are better developer tools. Not only is it easier to configure debuggers, formatters and static code checkers for c++, but compiling Fortran code can also be difficult on some platforms like Apple silicon. Lastly, templates make it easier to support special storage formats like banded or even distributed storage.    
This talk will discuss some design decisions, show some major advantages of using templates and finally we will show an overview of what has already been implemented in T-LAPACK.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75649' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1316' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1316)' class='star'><span class='star1316'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (G102)</b> Christian Trott, The Future of Linear Algebra in the C++ Standard <span id='bitlink-1216'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1216)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1216' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1216)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Future of Linear Algebra in the C++ Standard</b><br />Christian Trott<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-290.html'>Recent Advances in Numerical Linear Algebra Programming and Libraries - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Linear Algebra support is coming to the ISO C++ standard, delivering a future where developers of scientific code do not need to explicitly deal with specific vendor APIs or Fortran/C++ interoperability just to call a matrix-vector multiply. In this talk I will provide an update on the status of this effort, and directions of further extensions of the proposal. I will also discuss some early experience with implementations of the proposal, including an early prototype preview which comes with NVIDIA's HPC-SDK. Attendees will also learn a bit about C++23 mdspan, as the foundational layer on which the linear algebra effort rests.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75649' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1317' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1317)' class='star'><span class='star1317'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G102)</b> Riley J.

RandNLA algorithms are unparalleled in their capacity for producing approximate solutions to problems such as low-rank approximation. For suitably structured problems, they can even offer substantial speedups over deterministic methods without sacrificing accuracy.    
  This talk describes the philosophy of RandLAPACK – an aspiring standard library for RandNLA. Through careful identification of motifs occurring across RandNLA, it is possible to articulate many algorithms without making strong assumptions on the implementations of their core subroutines. This motivates RandLAPACK’s object-oriented design: interfaces are used to specify the semantics of tasks, while algorithms manifest as interface-conformant classes. In order for an algorithm to be executed it is necessary to instantiate it as an object in-memory. By allowing these objects to be stateful, we are able to achieve excellent performance without complicating the semantics of the task that an algorithm needs to carry out.

We discuss the portability of the software design of SLATE,  including the use of  C++ templates and matrix abstractions, and the implementation of the BLAS++ and LAPACK++ packages for vendor and device abstraction.   SLATE implements tile-based algorithms to execute effectively on HPC architectures using batch-BLAS, OpenMP and MPI to achieve performance and scalability.

In Julia, a software package called NEP-PACK, has been developed by researchers at KTH university Stockholm to deal with and solve such NEPs. It contains an extensive library of state-of-the-art algorithms. One algorithm for solving NEPs that it does not yet provide, is AAA-EIGS. Its main application is to find eigenvalues in some specified subregion of the complex plane for large, sparse NEPs. AAA-EIGS uses AAA for setting up rational approximants of the nonlinearities in the NEP. Afterwards it linearizes the resulting rational eigenvalue problem and solves it using a compact version of the rational Krylov method (CORK). The eigenpairs computed by CORK are related to eigenpairs of the original NEP. When implementing AAA-EIGS in Julia, we numerically compare its performance to that of a similar method in NEP-PACK, named NLEIGS. They mainly differ in the way the rational approximation is constructed. Experiments show that the new AAA-EIGS implementation does significantly better than NLEIGS for most problems, which can be attributed to the use of AAA and a better implementation of CORK. Future work can be done to extend the AAA-EIGS implementation with more features to improve its performance.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75649' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

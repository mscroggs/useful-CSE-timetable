Boundary integral methods have several advantages in SH flow computations.  However, such problems exhibit flow singularities due to complex surface microstructure, which leads to mixed boundary conditions and geometric corners. Standard quadrature rules for smooth integrals result in a severe loss of accuracy.  Adaptive mesh refinement mitigates the issue, however, the size of the discrete problem grows significantly with refinement level, and it can still be difficult to obtain satisfactory accuracy due to the ill-conditioning of the linear system. To resolve these issues, we combine the recently developed Recursively Compressed Inverse Preconditioning (RCIP) method with a scaling technique and the Fast Multipole Method to obtain a fast and accurate numerical scheme for SH flow computations. Several examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the method.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75518' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk948' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(948)' class='star'><span class='star948'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (D403)</b> Anand Oza, Data - Driven Continuum Modeling of Active Nematics via Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics <span id='bitlink-872'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(872)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-872' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(872)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data - Driven Continuum Modeling of Active Nematics via Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics</b><br />Anand Oza<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-207.html'>Numerical Simulation of Bio-Inspired Fluid-Structure Interaction - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>Data-driven modeling methods have recently shown great potential in determining accurate continuum models for complex systems directly from experimental measurements. One such complex system is the active nematic liquid crystal system consisting of microtubule-motor protein assemblies immersed in a fluid. This system exhibits rich non-equilibrium behavior, including spontaneous creation and annihilation of topological defects. Although several models have been proposed for the system, the governing equations remain under debate.    
We here present a model extracted directly from experimental image data via the "sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics" (SINDy) data-driven modeling technique. This model discovery process includes extracting appropriate data for a continuum model from experimental data, constructing a plausible library of model terms, and solving a sparse regression problem. A number of issues arise in this process, including strong correlations between library terms and instabilities in the discovered models. We present numerical simulations and the results of some modern statistical and classical pen-and-paper analyses which combine to clarify the discovery results. We then discuss the physical implications of the learned model, and compare the model with those proposed previously.

When microtubules are sparse, their deformations are disordered, characterized by high-frequency buckling and inducing only localized flows. When many microtubules are present the nature of the microtubule deformations and induced flows can change dramatically, giving rise to long-range order and coherent flows. Using a combination of experiments, large-scale simulations of microtubules interacting hydrodynamically through a viscous fluid, and a coarse-grained theory for dense beds of filaments, we elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the self-organization of microtubule ensembles and their subsequent generation of rotation in artificially confined asters in Xenopus Laevis extract.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75518' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk950' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(950)' class='star'><span class='star950'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (D403)</b> Aditi Basu Bal, Statistical Shape Analysis of Shape Graphs with Applications to Retinal Blood-Vessel Networks <span id='bitlink-874'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(874)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-874' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(874)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Statistical Shape Analysis of Shape Graphs with Applications to Retinal Blood-Vessel Networks</b><br />Aditi Basu Bal<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-207.html'>Numerical Simulation of Bio-Inspired Fluid-Structure Interaction - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>This paper provides theoretical and computational developments in statistical shape analysis of shape graphs and demonstrates them using analysis of data from complex retinal blood-vessel (RBV) networks. The shape graphs are represented by a set of nodes and a set of edges (planar articulated curves) connecting some of these nodes. The goals are to utilize shapes of edges and connectivities and locations of nodes to: (1) characterize full shapes, (2) quantify shape differences, and (3) model statistical variability. We develop a mathematical representation, elastic Riemannian shape metrics, and associated tools for such statistical analysis. Specifically, we derive tools for graph matching,  shape geodesics, shape summaries, and shape modeling.   One key challenge here is the registration of nodes across large   graphs and we develop a novel multi-scale representation of shape graphs to handle this challenge. We utilize the concepts of (1) "effective resistance" to cluster nodes and (2) elastic shape averaging of edge curves, to change graph details while maintaining overall structures. Registration is then performed by bringing graphs to similar scales before matching. We demonstrate these ideas on Retinal Blood Vessel (RBV) networks taken from the STARE and DRIVE databases.

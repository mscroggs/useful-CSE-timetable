<h2>Kinetic Simulations of Astrophysical Processes -  - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1372' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1372)' class='star'><span class='star1372'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (G108)</b> Hannah Klion, Simulations of Magnetic Reconnection with a Pseudo-Spectral Maxwell Solver <span id='bitlink-1267'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1267)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1267' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1267)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Simulations of Magnetic Reconnection with a Pseudo-Spectral Maxwell Solver</b><br />Hannah Klion<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-303.html'>Kinetic Simulations of Astrophysical Processes -  - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Magnetized high-temperature plasmas are found in astrophysical settings like gamma-ray bursts, magnetars, and stellar coronae. These plasmas can undergo magnetic reconnection, which converts the potential energy of the magnetic fields to particle kinetic energy. This mechanism is an important source of particle acceleration and heating in astrophysical plasmas. Using the particle-in-cell code WarpX, we perform large first-principles 2D simulations of relativistic reconnection plasmas representative of those found in these environments. These simulations produce particle energies and plasmoid structures in agreement with results previously reported in the literature. Using this robust baseline case, we compare the accuracy and computational performance of three methods of solving Maxwellâ€™s equations, including the commonly-used second-order finite difference time domain (FDTD) method and the more advanced ultra-high-order pseudo-spectral analytical time domain (PSATD) method. This is the first time PSATD has been used in simulations of astrophysical reconnection. We find that for the reconnection problem, FDTD and PSATD are comparably accurate, but that time-to-solution with PSATD is half that of FDTD. These performance gains will make our 3D simulations of reconnection more tractable, and complement other efforts to improve simulation efficiency, such as the use of mesh refinement.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75678' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1373' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1373)' class='star'><span class='star1373'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (G108)</b> Luca Comisso, Fully Kinetic Simulations of Particle Acceleration in Plasma Turbulence <span id='bitlink-1268'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1268)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1268' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1268)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fully Kinetic Simulations of Particle Acceleration in Plasma Turbulence</b><br />Luca Comisso<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-303.html'>Kinetic Simulations of Astrophysical Processes -  - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Turbulence is often invoked to explain the origin of nonthermal particles in space and astrophysical plasmas. By means of 3D fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that turbulence in low-beta plasmas (beta is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) accelerates ions and electrons into a nonthermal energy distribution with a power-law energy range. The ion spectrum is harder than the electron one, and both distributions get steeper for higher beta. We show that the energization of electrons is accompanied by a significant energy-dependent pitch-angle anisotropy, with most electrons moving parallel to the local magnetic field, while ions stay roughly isotropic. We demonstrate that particle injection from the thermal pool occurs in regions of high current density. Parallel electric fields associated with magnetic reconnection are responsible for the initial energy gain of electrons, whereas perpendicular electric fields control the overall energization of ions. Our findings have important implications for the origin of nonthermal particles in space and astrophysical plasmas.

Monte Carlo (MC) methods are a favorable algorithmic choice in these situations, given the inherent multi-dimensional and multi-physics nature of such phenomena. MC transport methods have traditionally used a history-based approach, where individual particle histories are tracked until census. With the recent computational shift to GPUs, an alternative "event-based" approach is becoming more attractive given their potential speedups compared to their history-based counterparts. In this talk, we present a CUDA implementation of an event-based MC method in the astrophysical radiative transfer code Sedona. Through a series of benchmark test problems, we examine the computational efficiency relative to a history-based CPU approach including strong and weak scaling measurements. We also demonstrate the drawbacks of event-based approaches for memory-bound situations that may appear in more realistic science production runs, and suggest potential workarounds in such cases.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75678' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1375' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1375)' class='star'><span class='star1375'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G108)</b> Florina M.

It is codesigned by computational (astrophysicists and cosmologists) and computer scientists (high-performance computing) to achieve scientific advances in astrophysics, cosmology, and high-performance computing, for highly scalable simulations using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. SPH-EXA includes highly optimized and parallelized off-the-shelf hydrodynamics and gravity solvers. It supports new particle types and particle data fields that can be combined with custom-made simulation-derived observable properties and in-situ data analysis.   It requires minimal software dependencies, provides scalable parallelization and communication support, and portability with optimizations for recent CPUs and GPUs.  This design relieves potential users from architectural specifics and performance concerns for scaling up simulations with SPH-EXA.  This talk will describe the SPH-EXA framework, its approach to domain decomposition, parallelization, gravity and hydrodynamics solvers, and their flexible use as pluggable components. A scalable initial conditions generator, test cases and simulations will also be presented.   SPH-EXA is extendable with additional physical effects through the use of propagators, whereby the pluggable framework components are easily customized or implemented from scratch using the provided building blocks in an abstract, efficient and scalable way.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75678' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

The foundations of BT lie in the Hankel operator and its singular values.   For continuous-time linear dynamical systems, BT preserves system stability in the reduced model and provides a priori bounds for the model reduction error.     
Although BT is generally conceived as an intrusive method, recent developments in [Gosea/Gugercin/Beattie, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2022] have shown that it can be reformulated as a non-intrusive, data-driven process. In this work, we study the connection between data-driven balancing and the Hankel operator associated with a continuous-time linear dynamical system.   We develop data-driven approximations of the Hankel operator based solely on input-output data and then show how a balanced reduced order realization can be constructed using this approximation. Based on these results, we propose an extension of the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm to a large class of continuous-time systems.

Although the underlying physics are usually well understood, adequately modelling these systems with constructive or physically motivated approaches is challenging in practice because e.g. material properties or domain geometries cannot be known at the required level of fidelity. Additionally, the model has to encompass the frequency span of human hearing - about three orders of magnitude. Hence, measurements have proven to be indispensable when dealing with real-world acoustical systems which makes high dimensional measurement data abundantly available.    
Classical realization methods, such as the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm, rely on the computation of orthogonal decompositions like SVD which is prohibitively expensive for the data at hand. As a remedy, these realization methods can be endowed with recent methods from randomized linear algebra for efficiently approximating orthogonal decompositions of large matrices. In this way, it is possible to construct accurate reduced order models from high dimensional data efficiently. In turn, this sheds new light onto many acoustical modelling challenges.    
The aim of this talk is to showcase and validate several contemporary extensions and augmentations to established realization methods and analyze their aptitude and performance in practical applications that involve high dimensional measurements of real systems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75369' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk444' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(444)' class='star'><span class='star444'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D506)</b> Michael S.

When these quantities are not available, data driven approaches can be used that require access only to input-output data.  Frequency-based data-driven methods have been very successful in creating high fidelity ROMs from data, but require access to values (and sometimes derivatives) of the transfer function.  These quantities can at times be costly or difficult to obtain, but one may have ample access to time-domain input-output data. In 2020, Burohman et al. introduced a framework to directly calculate transfer function values and derivatives using only time-domain data.  We first discuss improvements to this method that allow for a more efficient and robust numerical implementation, which lead to a theoretical result on optimal diagonal scaling of a class of matrices.  We then use these improvements to develop an algorithm that extends H2-optimal approximation to purely time-domain data.  We also compare the H2-optimal algorithm's performance to other well established frequency based ROM techniques (such as Loewner framework and Vector Fitting) using only time-domain data.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75369' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk445' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(445)' class='star'><span class='star445'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D506)</b> Thibault Monsel, End-to-End Learning of Dynamical Systems with the Mori-Zwanzig Formalism <span id='bitlink-410'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(410)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-410' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(410)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>End-to-End Learning of Dynamical Systems with the Mori-Zwanzig Formalism</b><br />Thibault Monsel<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-98.html'>Optimization-Based and Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling of Structured Dynamical Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>Deep learning approaches are extensively applied in order to capture the underlying dynamics of a physical phenomenon but often lack interpretability, performance, robustness guarantees and insights into the structure of the dynamics. In this work, we formulate the problem within the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism, a technique that arose in the field of statistical mechanics that allows to derive exact evolution equation for coarse-grained quantities of interest from high-dimensional systems. Not only this approach offers, by design, an explainable structure by separating the dynamics into a Markovian and a memory term but it allows a principled use of the available observational data by providing a physically consistent functional structure to learn. A neural network approximation format and efficient numerical integrator are coupled together, leading to a flexible and powerful representation model compliant with the MZ framework. The method is demonstrated on linear systems for which an analytical derivation of the MZ formalism is available allowing rigorous comparison; as well as on nonlinear, possibly chaotic, systems such as Van der Pol oscillator and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model, exhibiting a superior approximation performance in terms of data requirement and generalizability.

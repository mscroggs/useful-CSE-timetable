In particular, temporal blocking has been more geared towards CPUs due to the latency penalty of deep temporal blocking on GPUs. On the other hand embarrassingly parallel partial accumulation optimizations have been more suitable for GPUs. The latency of all operations across the spectrum on GPUs drop, while HPC-grade CPUs (ex: A64FX) become equipped with high bandwidth memory and wide vectors. As a results, in some aspects, the gap between GPUs and CPUs is shrinking. In this talk we first describe how GPUs have evolved in the last decade in a way that can make them more accommodating of stencil optimizations that favor low-latency architectures. We also describe the reverse effect: how some HPC-grade CPUs are more accommodating of stencil optimization that favor high-throughput architectures.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75737' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1507' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1507)' class='star'><span class='star1507'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D408)</b> Ali Momin, Stencil Computations in Petroleum Industry <span id='bitlink-1382'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1382)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1382' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1382)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stencil Computations in Petroleum Industry</b><br />Ali Momin<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-332.html'>Stencil Computation for Scientific Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>To Be Defined..  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75737' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1508' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1508)' class='star'><span class='star1508'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D408)</b> Issam Said,  Accelerated Stencil Computations on NVIDIA H100 <span id='bitlink-1383'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1383)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1383' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1383)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b> Accelerated Stencil Computations on NVIDIA H100</b><br />Issam Said<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-332.html'>Stencil Computation for Scientific Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>GPUs are very popular to compute 3D finite difference stencils.   Compared to naive implementations, optimized Stencil kernels can provide a significant speedup.    
Paulius Micikevicius described an optimized implementation on early CUDA GPUs using a mix of register queues and shared memory. Although the method described still apply today, we can apply a few modifications to keep these stencil codes running as fast as possible on the latest architectures.    
Today's GPUs are significantly more powerful than the NVIDIA Tesla S1070 used in the original paper.    
The number of compute cores has grown significantly, Tensor Cores are available to accelerate GEMMs, the memory bandwidth numbers have improved by an order of magnitude with the adoption of HBM, the L2 caches are now significantly larger, and newer instructions have been introduced to help move data in and out of the symmetrical multiprocessor (SM) units more efficiently.    
The memory bandwidth has also grown significantly, and is often the main bottleneck for these problems.    
Finite difference stencil codes are typically bandwidth-bound, and the goal for stencil codes should be to move the minimum amount of data, at speeds as close as possible to the theoretical peak bandwidth.     
In this talk we suggest a new method of Stencil Computation with some experimentation on the latest NVIDIA GPU, H100.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75737' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1509' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1509)' class='star'><span class='star1509'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D408)</b> Sebastian Kuckuk, Code Generation for the Simulation of Ocean Flows on Block-Structured Grids <span id='bitlink-1384'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1384)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1384' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1384)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Code Generation for the Simulation of Ocean Flows on Block-Structured Grids</b><br />Sebastian Kuckuk<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-332.html'>Stencil Computation for Scientific Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>Stencil computations and their application in various scientific domains have been an active field of research for the past decades.  We present our work on utilizing stencil technologies in complex application scenarios transcending simple benchmark problems.  One such domain is the simulation of ocean flows which requires support for real-world geometries, advanced numerical components, as well as domain-specific boundary conditions and source terms.    
Based on an early code version, we first transition from uniform to block-structured grids.  They are set up automatically by coarsely meshing a given geometry before applying multiple refinement steps and nodal position optimization.  Next, we extend for higher-order quadrature-free discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations.  The resulting compute kernels are more complex than traditional stencil codes but share beneficial characteristics such as vectorizability, consecutive memory accesses, and suitability for GPUs.    
To tackle performance portability and the high number of possible implementation variants, we employ code generation techniques.  The ExaStencils framework serves as an excellent base as it is capable of automatically optimizing stencil-like codes, as well as of parallelizing them with MPI, OpenMP and CUDA.  Its Python-based front end GHODDESS adds the necessary support for DG discretizations, and further increases performance through domain-specific optimizations on the algorithmic level.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75737' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1510' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1510)' class='star'><span class='star1510'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (D408)</b> Qing Xia, Difference Potentials Method Based on Local Basis Functions for Elliptic Partial Differential Equations in Arbitrary Geometry <span id='bitlink-1385'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1385)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1385' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1385)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Difference Potentials Method Based on Local Basis Functions for Elliptic Partial Differential Equations in Arbitrary Geometry</b><br />Qing Xia<br />Thursday, March 2 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-332.html'>Stencil Computation for Scientific Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>We develop efficient and high-order accurate finite difference methods for elliptic partial differential equations in complex geometry in the Difference Potentials framework. The main novelty in the developed methods is the use of local basis functions defined at near-boundary grid points. The use of local basis functions allow unified numerical treatment of (i) explicitly and implicitly defined geometry; (ii) geometry of more complicated shapes, such as those with corners, multi-connected domain, etc; and (iii) different types of boundary conditions. This geometrically flexible approach with local basis functions is a complement and improvement to the traditional DPM with global basis function approaches, especially in the case where a large number of global basis functions are needed to resolve the boundary data, or where the optimal global basis functions are difficult to obtain. Another feature of this work is that fast Poisson solvers based on FFT can be employed for standard centered finite difference stencils regardless of the designed order of accuracy (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.). The techniques developed in this paper can also be applied to the numerical solutions of time-dependent partial differential equations, when implicit time stepping is employed.

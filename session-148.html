The so-called hybrid-twin results from the hybridation of both components, making use of the existing knowledge and the collected data appropriately assimilated into the models (calibration) and on the machine learning training. The issue related to the optimal data collection (what data where and when) as well as the most informative one (active leaning) will be also addressed. The general framework will be illustrated with some major achivements.

These methods aim at providing a diagnostic suit, which is able to notify the operators on the occurrence of faults as well as on the necessity to undertake possible actions in real-time. Although such strategies may prove significantly more efficient than traditional time-based maintenance approaches, the challenge of implementation consists in the requirement for more sophisticated data processing techniques that will allow to distill the measured information and extract a set of robust and condition-sensitive indicators.    
This contribution is focused on the fusion on data-driven and physics-based modeling techniques, in order to devise a computationally efficient framework for online assimilation of output-only vibration measurements into the virtual instances of monitored systems, towards the materialization of real-time Digita Twins (DTs). The major challenges to be addressed in this respect are associated with the methodological tools and the modeling-related aspects, which comprise the uncertainty and complexity related to global model-based approaches, the nonlinear effects occurring on slender components, the system variability induced by the changing environmental and operational conditions and the existence of structural flaws.

Digital twins are rapidly spreading and are used in a diverse range of engineering applications. They allow predictive maintenance, optimization, and planning, among others. In this talk we present a digital representation of an unmanned aerial vehicle, focusing on its structural health, in the framework of autonomous aerial cargo missions. We show how to incorporate adaptive planning, assimilating information during the operational regime. We parametrize the state transition probability of the underlying Markov decision process with a beta distributed random variable. We exploit a Bernoulli process to update the posterior distribution without the need of numerical integration. This allows the selection of a new policy at every time step, adapting online the planning strategy to balance the structural self-preservation and time to arrive at client location.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75443' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk674' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(674)' class='star'><span class='star674'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G105)</b> Karim Cherifi, Challenges and Requirements in Modeling Electrical Machines for Digital Twins <span id='bitlink-627'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(627)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-627' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(627)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Challenges and Requirements in Modeling Electrical Machines for Digital Twins</b><br />Karim Cherifi<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-148.html'>Digital Twins for Intelligent Dynamical Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>A Digital twin is a virtual representation of a system that uses physics based and data driven simulations to improve prediction, optimization, monitoring, controlling of the system. In this work the focus is on developing a digital twin for an electrical machine. Based on the functions of the digital twin, we present the requirements on the simulations that needs to be developed and the main challenges facing the construction of these models. These challenges include real-time simulations, multiphysics coupling, data assimilation and adaptive modeling.    
We present an initial investigation of those challenges by proposing solutions using hierarchical and port-Hamiltonian modeling.  Port-Hamiltonian systems provide a framework that works across different physical domains and different scales and that can help in the development of the digital twin for electrical machines, in particular on the industrial scale. An outlook at potential solutions of the challenges and topics that are still open is also discussed.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75443' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk675' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(675)' class='star'><span class='star675'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (G105)</b> Diana Manvelyan, On a Digital Twin for Contact Mechanics Driven by Operator-Inference-Based Model Order Reduction Approach <span id='bitlink-628'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(628)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-628' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(628)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On a Digital Twin for Contact Mechanics Driven by Operator-Inference-Based Model Order Reduction Approach</b><br />Diana Manvelyan<br />Wednesday, March 1 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-148.html'>Digital Twins for Intelligent Dynamical Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>Many industrial problems include mechanical contacts, which often are a pitfall in the context of real-time simulations. Model order reduction techniques are in general utilized for enabling fast simulations. For constrained problems such as contacts, an additional treatment is required. Novel physics-based reduction methods for contact problems were presented in [Manvelyan et al., Comput Mech 68, 1283–1295 (2021), Manvelyan et al., Int J Numer Methods Eng, 1-27, (2022)]. Within this work we introduce a new method, which is a generalization of the recent physics-based reduction frameworks. The generalized method is driven by operator inference method and adjoint methods. That way the unconstrained problem can be learned from data stemming from black-box models, whereas the contact behavior is reproduced within the adjoint system describing the Lagrange multipliers, i.e., the variables that enforce the contact conditions.   	    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75443' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

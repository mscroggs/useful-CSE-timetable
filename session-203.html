To that end, we employ a discontinuous-Galerkin method  in space and time, and a moment method in velocity.  We base our method on a converging sequence of approximations  to the collision operator.   We associate with each member of this sequence a  normalisation map for the distribution function and an entropy.  We show that each approximate collision operator inherits salient properties  from Boltzmann's operator,  such as the preservation of the collision operator, the H-theorem  and that the linearisations near equilibrium agree.  We prove that our method is entropy-stable  for each member of the sequence of approximations to the collision operator.  Finally, we apply our method to the Boltzmann equation  with full collision operator and demonstrate the corresponding approximation properties,  using benchmark test cases, in comparison to Direct Simulation Monte Carlo.

Numerical approximations that mirror this property are said to be asymptotic preserving.  In this paper we build two discontinuous Galerkin methods to the semiconductor model: one with the standard upwinding flux and the other with a $\varepsilon$-scaled Lax-Friedrichs flux, where 1/$\varepsilon$ is the scale of the collision frequency.  We show that these schemes are uniformly stable in $\varepsilon$ and are asymptotic preserving.  In particular, we discuss what properties the discrete Maxwellian must satisfy in order for the schemes to converge in $\varepsilon$ to an accurate $h$-approximation of the drift diffusion limit.  Discrete versions of the drift-diffusion equation and error estimates in several norms with respect to $\varepsilon$ and the spacial resolution are also included.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75513' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk928' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(928)' class='star'><span class='star928'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM (D507)</b> Stefano Boccelli, Modelling High Mach Number Low-Collisional Flows Using the Maximum-Entropy Moment Method <span id='bitlink-854'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(854)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-854' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(854)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Modelling High Mach Number Low-Collisional Flows Using the Maximum-Entropy Moment Method</b><br />Stefano Boccelli<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-203.html'>Multiscale Methods for Kinetic Models: Theory and Numerics - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>High Mach number and low-collisional flows are frequently encountered during the high-velocity atmospheric entry of blunt bodies, such as meteoroids, satellites and spacecrafts. In the first part of the entry trajectory, the flow is highly rarefied, and convection and surface interaction dominate over particle collisions. Macroscopically, one observes a diffuse shock in front of the body and a very-low density shadow behind it. In both these regions, the gas is out of thermodynamic (translational) equilibrium, and the particle velocity distribution function deviates from the Maxwellian distribution. Traditional fluid methods such as the Euler and the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations are unable to reproduce these situations accurately.   In this work, we investigate the application of maximum-entropy moment methods to this problem, considering the 10 and 14-moment systems. These methods consist in a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations, that extend the validity of the NSF equations to strongly non-equilibrium conditions. We analyze the accuracy of the maximum-entropy solutions and the associated computational cost, that depends on the trajectory of the solution in moment space. A BGK collision model is employed for simplicity. Maximum-entropy results are compared to a particle-based solution of the kinetic equation.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75513' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk929' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(929)' class='star'><span class='star929'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM (D507)</b> Pietro Parodi, Analysis of Implicit PIC Schemes and Their Application to Electric Propulsion <span id='bitlink-855'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(855)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-855' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(855)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Analysis of Implicit PIC Schemes and Their Application to Electric Propulsion</b><br />Pietro Parodi<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-203.html'>Multiscale Methods for Kinetic Models: Theory and Numerics - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Simulation of plasmas for space electric propulsion is a complex task because of two reasons: first, the size of interest of the system is usually comparable to the collisional length scale. As a result, velocity distributions are often in nonequilibrium. Using the hybrid Particle-in-Cell - Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (PIC-DSMC) method allows to overcome this problem, since phase space can be efficiently represented using computational particles. Secondly, the length- and time scales of interest are often much larger than the smallest natural scales of the plasma, which are dictated by electrons. Traditional explicit PIC schemes need to resolve these small scales, otherwise disrupting numerical instabilities appear. These requirements can make simulation of an entire physical device extremely expensive, and practically unfeasible above a certain plasma density. Recently, a new class of implicit and semi-implicit methods have been devised, mostly for applications in astrophysics. These feature exact total energy conservation and are stable for cell sizes and time steps well in excess of the Debye length and plasma frequency, allowing the simulation of higher density plasmas in larger domains. We present our finite element implementation of the electrostatic version of these schemes, and analyze their properties through simple numerical experiments. Finally, we investigate how these methods can be applied to the simulation of electric propulsion and laboratory plasmas.

Such a model introduces a single continuous variable supposed to capture all the phenomena related to the more complex structure of a polyatomic molecule.    
 We then focus on the kinetic model for which the rigorous existence and uniqueness result in the space homogeneous case is recently proven[Gamba and Pavic-Colic,2020]. Using extended version of the cross-section proposed in that analysis we establish macroscopic models of fourteen and seventeen fields. In addition, the model introduces frozen collisions when a polyatomic molecule behaves as a monatomic one[Djordjic et al.,2021]. For the fourteen and seventeen moments model, using the publicly available computer algebra code [Djordjic et al.,2021], we compute relaxation times and transport coefficients such as shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity as well as its ratio - the Prandtl number. Next, we examine differences in transport coefficients from these two moments systems and find equivalence for the specific choice of parameters from the cross-section model. However, we expect that with an increasing number of moments the transport coefficients will converge for all possible parameter choices in the cross-section.

Basically, it is a virtual image of a real asset, integrating all data, models and other digital information over the lifecycle. Its true power lies in the relationship with its physical counterpart. Data acquired on the physical asset can validate and enrich the digital twin. Inversely, the digital representation can bring value to the physical asset. Dedicated digital twin encapsulations can be extracted to model a specific set of behaviors in a specific context, delivering a stand-alone executable representation referred to as the Executable Digital Twin. The process and basic methodologies of the Executable Digital Twin are reviewed. Key enabling technologies are fast simulation methods, Model Order Reduction and state estimation. Data reduction approaches include the use of machine learning to allow compact representations of complex non-linear systems. Hybrid co-simulation linking the executable models in an open runtime environment are key.   The concept is illustrated by several examples in the automotive, aerospace and manufacturing industries. This includes embedded models for virtual sensing, model-based control, performance monitoring and X-in-the-loop hybrid testing. Also, the potential to use the Executable Digital Twin as a companion to the physical asset through its lifecycle for decision support is discussed. An outlook on open challenges will identify further research needs.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75444' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk678' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(678)' class='star'><span class='star678'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (G105)</b> Oliver Barrowclough, Probabilistic Geometry Reconstruction for Additive Manufacturing Digital Twins <span id='bitlink-630'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(630)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-630' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(630)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Probabilistic Geometry Reconstruction for Additive Manufacturing Digital Twins</b><br />Oliver Barrowclough<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-149.html'>Digital Twins for Intelligent Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>As more and more critical parts are being fabricated via additive manufacturing (AM), there is an increasing need to ensure that the geometric and material properties of the parts conform to certain requirements. Currently this need is addressed by expensive, time consuming, and environmentally wasteful destructive testing of physical replica components. However, with more and more connected sensors being installed in AM machines, new possibilities are emerging for creating digital replicas, or digital twins, of the physical parts, inline. Such digital twins can be used as a basis for qualifying parts digitally, removing the need for excess physical parts.    
In this talk we will discuss approaches for creating digital twins from inline sensor data, focussing on the problem of extracting the geometry from volumetric images. To do this we transfer techniques developed in the medical imaging domain, to the setting of AM. A digital twin is never an exact representation of the physical object or process, as there are unknowns inherent in both the dynamics of the process and in the capture of the sensor data. We therefore also investigate the use of techniques such as Kalman filters and Markov random fields to capture these uncertainties in the digital twin.

Several reduced bases may be simultaneously manipulated, either to project the equations onto a lower dimensional subspace, or to approximate nonlinear terms resisting the real time constraint. These reduced bases are often computed with the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) which requires snapshots of the solution for a given set of parameters. A difficulty then arises when it comes to adapt both efficiently and accurately these multiple reduced bases for new set of parameters.    
In this contribution, we compare different state of the art approaches to build the parametric reduced order model of a gas bearings dynamical system. We revisit the Interpolation on the Tangent Space of the Grassmann Manifold (ITSGM) technique, and we propose several improvements. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the potential of the developed model to perform fast and accurate simulations for future digital twin applications.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75444' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk680' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(680)' class='star'><span class='star680'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (G105)</b> Brian Weston, Virtual Inspection of 3D Printing via Process-Scale Digital Twins and Computer Vision <span id='bitlink-632'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(632)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-632' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(632)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Virtual Inspection of 3D Printing via Process-Scale Digital Twins and Computer Vision</b><br />Brian Weston<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-149.html'>Digital Twins for Intelligent Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>In the age of digitalization, physical objects are increasingly being represented by digital twins. Our work at LLNL focuses on developing digital twins of additive manufacturing (AM) systems and processes with the goal of virtually designing and optimizing 3D printed components before needing to manufacture them.     
Currently, we manufacture mission-critical components from direct-ink-write AM systems and manually inspect and test parts. Using on-board sensor data from cameras and kinematic motion data, our work aims to automate the inspection and testing process by geometrically tolerancing parts with deep learning and computer vision. Furthermore, we aim to improve the accuracy of our process-scale digital twin of the 3D printing process by injecting real sensor noise into the simulator. We also compare our digital and physical twins in a virtual reality (VR) environment, allowing for intuitive interactions among multiple collaborators who need not be co-located.     
Using in situ process monitoring, data-driven prediction enhancement, and VR, we hope to yield insights into machine health, preventative maintenance, and corrective strategies with the goal of moving toward AM process certification.

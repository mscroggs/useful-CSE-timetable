A key feature of these problems is that the dynamics occurs on nanometer to micrometer scales.  At those scales, thermal fluctuations play an important role in the overall dynamics and are expected to have significant impact on overall behavior of the system, particularly for problems such as those discussed above that are far from equilibrium. Here, we introduce a model for multiphase, multicomponent mixtures based on an N-component form of the Flory-Huggins extension to regular solution theory.  The thermodynamics of the system is described by a free energy that includes entropy and enthalpy of mixing as well as non-local terms representing interfacial tension.  The multiphase model is incorporated into a fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) model for nonideal liquid mixtures.  The FHD model represents thermal fluctuations by adding stochastic flux terms to both the species transport and momentum equations based on a model originally proposed  Landau and Lifshitz.  The presentation will discuss the basic formulation of the model and sketch the derivation of the equations of motion.  Numerical results will be presented validating the model and illustrating the range of phenomena that it can represent. Finally, we will show how fluctuations shift the stability region Rayleigh-Plateau instability that describes the breakup of fluid threads.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75538' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1004' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1004)' class='star'><span class='star1004'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (E106)</b> Sean P.

Current research uses temperature-induced phase separation of aqueous  polymer mixtures to efficiently fabricate microparticles of desired shapes and sizes. To better understand  this process, we develop several mathematical models of microscale phase separation of ternary fluid mixtures.  While the equilibrium configuration of the microparticles is described by a volume-constrained minimization of  a Ginzburg-Landau free energy, a diffuse interface fluid mechanical model reveals a wide landscape of interesting  parameter regimes; varying surface tensions, densities, viscosities, and concentrations can all influence the  microparticle manufacture. We discuss some key features of a Cahn-Hilliard-Stokes model used to describe these  effects, as well as its simulation with a pseudo-spectral method, and we highlight how fluid stresses can influence  microparticle evolution.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75538' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1005' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1005)' class='star'><span class='star1005'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (E106)</b> Eric W.

Current research uses temperature-induced phase separation to efficiently fabricate polymer gel microparticles of desired shapes and sizes. To better understand this process, we develop several models of microscale phase separation of ternary fluids. A simple surface energy minimisation model describes possible equilibrium microparticle shapes. We then interrogate the dynamics of microparticle manufacture by combining a ternary Cahn-Hilliard model with surface tension- and buoyancy-driven Stokes flow in the Cahn-Hilliard-Stokes-Boussinesq (CHSB) model. By simulating the CHSB model in three dimensions using the efficient Dedalus spectral code, we show that all physical effects - surface tension, fluid flow, and buoyancy - are necessary for microparticles to attain minimal energy crescent configurations. Without fluid flow or buoyancy, microparticles consistently settle on spherical shell equilibria, in contrast to experiments. We then outline how varying surface energies, densities, viscosities, and concentrations can each influence microparticle manufacture, before concluding with a discussion of how fluid stresses drive microparticle evolution.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75538' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1006' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1006)' class='star'><span class='star1006'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (E106)</b> Duncan Lockerby, Simulation of Micro-Scale Particulate and Droplet Motion in Gases <span id='bitlink-927'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(927)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-927' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(927)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Simulation of Micro-Scale Particulate and Droplet Motion in Gases</b><br />Duncan Lockerby<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-220.html'>Multiphase Flows at the Microscale - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>Low-speed gas flow around micro-scale particles (e.g. soot and other pollutants), and through suspensions of particles, are surprisingly rich in physics and challenging to simulate. The hydrodynamic reach of a single particle is extremely wide, preventing application of straightforward numerical-simulation approaches (e.g. finite-volume CFD). Furthermore, their scale renders the conventional Navier-Stokes equations, and associated boundary conditions, inaccurate, unable to capture rarefied effects such as thermophoresis and velocity slip. The problems are especially challenging in the transitional Knudsen regime for non-canonical geometries.    
In this paper, a framework is presented for simulating micro-scale particulate flows using the Method of Fundamental Solutions, applied to the linearised Grad’s 13 moment equations, which provides a convenient and numerically efficient alternative to solving the full Boltzmann equation.     
A range of particulate geometry are considered, including agglomerates, such as soot. We present a methodology to couple heat transfer within the solid particle (i.e. for problems of finite particle conductivity) to that of the external rarefied gas flowfield. Results are compared to available experimental results and known analytical results, where they exist.    
The talk describes research funded in the UK by the EPSRC (EP/N016602/1).

In the present contribution, we design specific numerical methods for their resolution. The key ingredient in these models is a good choice of state variables, which describe both the polydisperse character of a spray as well as the geometrical dynamics of non spherical droplets. The resulting system of equations is hyperbolic and involves a complex structure: the continuous solutions evolves in a convex set called the realizability domain. This induces constraints on the numerical methods. To achieve accuracy, robustness and realizability, we rely on kinetic finite volume schemes and Discontinuous Galerkin methods.    
We focus on a two-phase simulation of a polydisperse spray with oscillating droplets and assess the ability of the model and of the related numerical methods to capture the physics of such flows.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75538' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

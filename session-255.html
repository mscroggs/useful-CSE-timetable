Such problems are broadly known as inverse problem. Solving these generally requires some form of regularization and Bayesian techniques such as Gaussian process (GP) priors have proved useful to that end. Nevertheless, in most fields of applications, there exists prior knowledge about the unknown phenomenon that cannot be directly included in the specification of the GP prior and would be better modelled by a set of trend functions. In this presentation, we will show how the traditional, GP-based Bayesian inversion framework can be extended to include (partially) known trends. These trends are modelled as linear combinations of basis functions with a multivariate Gaussian prior on the trend coefficients. In essence, this is an extension of the usual universal kriging approach to inverse problems,  which we thus deem "universal inversion". We will demonstrate our universal inversion techniques on a large-scale gravimetric inverse problem based on data collected on Stromboli island, demonstrating how field knowledge can help improve the inversion. The introduction of trends in the inversion process fosters new questions pertaininig to model selection. To tackle these, we extend recent results about fast k-fold cross-validation to the inverse problem and present an overview of the new venues of inquiry in model selection opened by fast cross-validation.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75581' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1163' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1163)' class='star'><span class='star1163'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (E106)</b> David Freeman, Quantum Mechanics for Closure of Dynamical Systems <span id='bitlink-1075'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1075)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1075' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1075)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quantum Mechanics for Closure of Dynamical Systems</b><br />David Freeman<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-255.html'>Blending Learning and Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>When modelling chaotic dynamical systems, notably in climate prediction models, a common obstacle is the issue of approximating the dynamics of dimensions of the state space for which dynamical laws are unknown. Common approaches to solving this issue include parametrization schemes which employ stochasticity or which are exclusively dependent on the internal state of the system at a given time. We propose a novel parametrization scheme based on the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and Koopman operator theory. Given a system in which some components of the state are unknown, this method involves defining the surrogate system as being in a time-dependent “quantum-state” which influences the choice of the unknown component of the classical state at each timestep. The quantum state is an operator on the space of classical observables and evolves over time under an action by the Koopman operator. The quantum state also updates with new data-points according to a quantum Bayes’ law, and evolves under the action of data-driven operators. Kernel functions are utilized to allow the quantum Bayes’ law to be implemented numerically. We analyze the results of two different modalities of this methodology applied to the Lorenz 63’ and Lorenz 96‘ systems, and show how this approach preserves important statistical and qualitative properties of the underlying chaotic systems.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75581' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1164' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1164)' class='star'><span class='star1164'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (E106)</b> Edoardo Calvello, Ensemble Kalman Methods: A Mean Field Perspective <span id='bitlink-1076'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1076)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1076' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1076)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Ensemble Kalman Methods: A Mean Field Perspective</b><br />Edoardo Calvello<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-255.html'>Blending Learning and Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>The ensemble Kalman methodology is an innovative and flexible set of tools which can be used for both state estimation in dynamical systems and parameter estimation for generic inverse problems. It has primarily been developed by practitioners in the geophysical sciences, with notable impact on the fields of oceanography, oil reservoir simulation and weather forecasting. Despite its wide adoption in fields of application, firm theoretical foundations are only now starting to emerge. In this talk we consider the problem from the perspectives of both control theory and probability, and provide a unifying approach to algorithms that rests on transport of measures and mean field stochastic dynamical systems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75581' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1165' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1165)' class='star'><span class='star1165'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (E106)</b> Miguel &#193;. &#193;lvarez B., Unbiased Estimators Applied to the Ensemble Kalman-Bucy Filter <span id='bitlink-1077'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1077)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1077' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1077)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Unbiased Estimators Applied to the Ensemble Kalman-Bucy Filter</b><br />Miguel &#193;. &#193;lvarez B.<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-255.html'>Blending Learning and Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>We consider the development of an unbiased estimator for the ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter (EnKBF). The EnKBF is a continuous-time  filtering methodology which can be viewed as a continuous-time analogue of the famous discrete-time ensemble Kalman filter. Our unbiased estimators will be motivated from  recent work which introduces randomization as a means to produce unbiased and finite variance estimators. Our estimator will be specific to linear and  Gaussian settings, where we know that the EnKBF is consistent, in the particle limit $N \rightarrow \infty$, with the KBF. We highlight this for two particular  variants of the EnKBF, i.e. the deterministic and vanilla variants, and demonstrate this on a linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We compare this with the EnKBF   and the multilevel (MLEnKBF), for experiments with varying dimension size.

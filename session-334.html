It aims at implementing doctoral programs by partnership of universities and industries. Young researchers enrolled in this type of projects are jointly supervised by academic and industrial partners and work on research projects that are inspired by real industrial challenges. The program is an excellent opportunity for young people who are looking to step outside academic world and broaden their skills and it is open to students from all over the world. The details of the partnership between academia and industry will be presented in this talk as well as some examples of successful EID in mathematics.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75739' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1516' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1516)' class='star'><span class='star1516'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Andrew Salinger, CSE Careers in the United States' DOE National Laboratories <span id='bitlink-1391'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1391)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1391' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1391)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>CSE Careers in the United States' DOE National Laboratories</b><br />Andrew Salinger<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-334.html'>Career Opportunities in Computational Science and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>The National Laboratories that are operated by the United States Department of Energy (DOE Labs) provide opportunities for excellent careers performing research and development in Computational Science and Engineering.    
The DOE Labs specialize in Big Science, including foundational and applied research that requires large, interdisciplinary teams, working on grand challenge applications such as fusion energy, climate modeling, battery technology, next-generation computing architectures, and a host of national security applications.     
Many of us have found a career at the DOE Labs to be the ideal middle ground between academia and industry, where we can work on challenging problems with excellent colleagues to advance technology to tackle some of the world\'s most pressing issues.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75739' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk2071' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2071)' class='star'><span class='star2071'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:50 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Ton de Kok, Industrial Mathematics and Mathematics in Industry <span id='bitlink-1896'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1896)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1896' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1896)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Industrial Mathematics and Mathematics in Industry</b><br />Ton de Kok<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:50 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-334.html'>Career Opportunities in Computational Science and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>In this presentation we discuss the challenges and opportunities of working as a mathematician in industry. We distinguish the different functional areas in industry, such as R&D, purchasing, manufacturing, sales and distribution, and the types of mathematics used in those areas. Dependent on the functional area, there is more or less appreciation of what a mathematician can contribute. We discuss these differences in appreciation and their implications for the mathematician at work. We share experiences of working as a mathematician in and with industry.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75739' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1518' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1518)' class='star'><span class='star1518'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:55 AM&ndash;11:10 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Bas van der Linden, Lessons from 10 Years of Mathematical Consultancy <span id='bitlink-1392'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1392)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1392' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1392)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Lessons from 10 Years of Mathematical Consultancy</b><br />Bas van der Linden<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:55 AM&ndash;11:10 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-334.html'>Career Opportunities in Computational Science and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Sioux Technologies is a global technology partner that supports or acts as the R&D department for high-tech companies. The company has a unique market position due to its dedicated applied mathematics department of about 60 engineers, branded the 'Mathware' department. This department applies mathematics in a very broad sense, from computational physics, through signal processing up to artificial intelligence. The Mathware department spun out of the mathematics department of the Technical University of Eindhoven a little over 10 years ago. Over these 10 years (and more), many lessons have been learned on how to approach industrial mathematics coming from a background of applied and numerical mathematics in an academic setting, as well as experiencing the growth from 10 people to 60 people. These experiences have led to principled approaches applied by Sioux regarding people management, technology management, software quality management and foremost project management through 'the Mathware method'.

<h2>Parallel Linear Solvers for Ill-Conditioned Engineering Design Problems - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk497' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(497)' class='star'><span class='star497'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM (D301)</b> Shaked Regev, Hykkt: A Hybrid Direct and Iterative Method for Solving Kkt Linear Systems <span id='bitlink-460'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(460)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-460' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(460)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hykkt: A Hybrid Direct and Iterative Method for Solving Kkt Linear Systems</b><br />Shaked Regev<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-110.html'>Parallel Linear Solvers for Ill-Conditioned Engineering Design Problems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>We propose a solution strategy for the large indefinite linear systems arising in interior methods for nonlinear optimization.  The method is suitable for implementation on hardware accelerators such as graphical processing units (GPUs). The current gold standard for sparse indefinite systems is the LBL factorization where L is a lower triangular matrix and B is 1X1 or 2X2 block diagonal. However, this requires pivoting, which substantially increases communication cost and degrades performance on GPUs. Our approach solves a large indefinite system by solving multiple smaller positive definite systems, using an iterative solver on the Schur complement and an inner direct solve (via Cholesky factorization) within each iteration. Cholesky is stable without pivoting, thereby reducing communication and allowing reuse of the symbolic factorization. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach on large optimal power flow problems and show that it can efficiently utilize GPUs and outperform LBL factorization of the full system.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75385' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk498' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(498)' class='star'><span class='star498'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (D301)</b> Steven Hamilton, Preconditioning a GPU-Enabled Compressible CFD Solver <span id='bitlink-461'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(461)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-461' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(461)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Preconditioning a GPU-Enabled Compressible CFD Solver</b><br />Steven Hamilton<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-110.html'>Parallel Linear Solvers for Ill-Conditioned Engineering Design Problems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Oak Ridge National Laboratory is developing the Spinnaker code, an implicit time-dependent compressible-flow computational fluid dynamics solver targeting a variety of fluid flow applications. Spinnaker is built using finite element assembly, linear algebra, and automatic differentiation capabilities from the Trilinos code library. The Kokkos performance portability layer allows kernels to be compiled for several different computing architectures, including multithreaded CPUs, Nvidia GPUs, and AMD GPUs.    
Spinnaker uses an implicit time-stepping approach with Newton's method as a nonlinear solver within each time step. GMRES (potentially with restarting) is typically used as the linear solver. The preconditioner selection has primarily focused on overlapping additive Schwarz type preconditioners with a sparse direct solver used for the local domain blocks. Preconditioners based on incomplete factorizations (also within an additive Schwarz approach) and algebraic multigrid methods have also been evaluated.     
This talk will provide an evaluation of the linear solvers and preconditioners used within Spinnaker for several compressible 2D and 3D fluid flow problems. A variety of CPU-only and GPU-enabled preconditioners are evaluated, including native options in Trilinos as well as the SuperLU and Nvidia cuSOLVER libraries. Results will include parallel scaling studies and profiling to illustrate current performance bottlenecks.

Their nature makes it challenging to solve them efficiently in a fine-grain parallel fashion. Iterative linear solvers, which can be parallelized effectively, are not performing well on such ill-conditioned problems. Traditional supernodal and multifrontal parallel strategies used in direct linear solvers are not effective with extremely sparse systems, because dense blocks created by these methods are too small to take advantage of fast dense linear algebra. These challenges impede deployment of design computations to heterogeneous compute platforms, which use hardware accelerators such as GPUs.    
We propose linear solver strategy tailored to fine-grain parallel design computations. We take advantage of design computations creating a sequence of linear systems with the same sparsity pattern to perform first factorization on the host and then move sparse factors to the hardware accelerator. Each subsequent linear solve is reusing the same ordering and symbolic factorization and performs numerical (re)factorization using a partial pivoting method. This strategy requires advanced iterative refinement to recover solution of required quality. We present our results and show performance improvement over current state of the art. We discuss future research directions to develop robust sparse linear solvers that perform well on hardware accelerators.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75385' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk501' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(501)' class='star'><span class='star501'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (D301)</b> Petr Vacek, Stopping Criteria for Coarsest-Grid Solver in Multigrid V-Cycle Method <span id='bitlink-464'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(464)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-464' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(464)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stopping Criteria for Coarsest-Grid Solver in Multigrid V-Cycle Method</b><br />Petr Vacek<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-110.html'>Parallel Linear Solvers for Ill-Conditioned Engineering Design Problems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Multigrid methods are frequently used when solving systems of linear equations, applied either as standalone solvers or as preconditioners for iterative methods. Within each cycle, the approximation is computed using smoothing on fine levels and solving on the coarsest level.    
With growth of the size of the problems that are being solved, the size of the problems on the coarsest grid is also growing and their solution can become a computational bottleneck. In practice the problems on the coarsest-grid are often solved approximately, for example by Krylov subspace methods or direct methods based on low rank approximation; see, e.g., [M. Huber, Massively parallel and fault-tolerant multigrid solvers on peta-scale systems, Ph.D. Thesis, Technical University of Munich, Germany, 2019], [Buttari et al., Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications (2021)]. The accuracy of the coarsest-grid solver is typically determined experimentally in order to balance the cost of the solves and the total number of multigrid cycles required for convergence.    
In this talk, we present an approach to analyzing the effect of approximate coarsest-grid solves in the multigrid V-cycle method for symmetric positive definite problems. We discuss several stopping criteria derived based on the analysis and suggest a strategy for utilizing them in practice. The results are illustrated through numerical experiments.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75385' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

The organism model is based on a specific limit of regularized Stokeslets, resulting in the superposition of a regularized stresslet and a regularized potential dipole at the same location, and an orientation vector. No special treatment of the self-velocity is necessary. Modeling &#8220;pusher” and &#8220;puller” organisms is straightforward, and the model can also be extended to flows bounded by a plane wall using a method of images and to organisms with rotating helical flagella by including rotlets. The model derivation will be sketched and its properties will be described through examples that show the motion, interaction and diffusion of these particles as a function of the concentration density.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75249' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk148' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(148)' class='star'><span class='star148'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM (G110)</b> Adam K.

Approaches to modelling this behaviour normally come in two flavours: a macroscale, course-grained approach where the fluid is modelled as a continuum; and a microscale, detailed approach where the anisotropic structure within the background fluid is specifically modelled. The former approach has the benefit of speed, but in this talk I will share my experience of attempting the latter, in 3D, using high-performance computer simulations, and show how these simulations suggest the physical structure of the viscoelastic fluid directly affects the microorganism swimming through it. We see some surprising differences with 2D and investigate why this might be so.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75249' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk149' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(149)' class='star'><span class='star149'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM (G110)</b> Lyndon Koens, Tubular-Body Theory <span id='bitlink-141'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(141)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-141' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(141)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tubular-Body Theory</b><br />Lyndon Koens<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-33.html'>Computational Methods and Analysis for Biological Applications in Stokes Flow - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Cable-like bodies play a key role in many biological fluid systems but are hard to simulate. Asymptotic theories, called slender-body theories, are effective but apply in specific regimes and can be hard to extend beyond leading order. In this presentation I will develop an exact slender-body-like theory for the surface traction of cable like bodies in viscous flow. This theory expresses the traction as a series of solutions to a well behaved one-dimensional Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. This process can be simply generalised to other systems. We test this theory against known solutions and then use it to look at the swimming of a tightly wound helix exposed to an external torque.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75249' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk150' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(150)' class='star'><span class='star150'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM (G110)</b> Sarah D.

The method of regularized Stokeslets has been heavily applied to micro-scale biofluids problems such as microorgianism locomotion. It is based on the boundary integral form of the Stokes equations where the singular fundamental solution (the "Stokeslet") is replaced with a smooth approximation. The method can be modified such that certain boundary conditions are satisfied automatically via the addition of an appropriate "image system" to the regularized Stokeslet. Here, we focus on the computation of fluid flows due to distributions of forces within a fluid-filled, spherical cavity because no regularized image system has been derived for this specific setting and because of its importance to flows driven by active structures within cells. We present two example problems in this context: the flow due to a translating particle and the flow due to a relaxing flexible filament contained in the cavity.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75249' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

One of the main technical difficulties in using efficient MDD methods (and most other efficient preconditioners) is that they require information from the underlying problem which prohibits them from being used as a black-box. I will present a framework that simplifies the analysis of the algebraic two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner. Based on this framework, I will present a series of robust and fully algebraic MDD methods, i.e., that can be constructed given only the coefficient matrix and guarantee a priori prescribed convergence rate. The series consists of preconditioners for least-squares problems, sparse SPD matrices, general sparse matrices, and certain saddle-point systems. Numerical experiments on challenging discretized PDEs and systems from the SuiteSparse Collection illustrate the effectiveness, wide applicability, scalability of the proposed preconditioners. A comparison of each one against state-of-the-art preconditioners is also presented.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75293' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk263' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(263)' class='star'><span class='star263'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (E101)</b> Daniel Osei-Kuffuor, Efficient Multigrid Reduction Strategies for Subsurface Flow Applications <span id='bitlink-245'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(245)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-245' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(245)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Multigrid Reduction Strategies for Subsurface Flow Applications</b><br />Daniel Osei-Kuffuor<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-58.html'>Scalable and Efficient Linear Solvers for Large Real-World Applications</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>Simulation of subsurface fluid flow involves solving a multi-physics problem in which multiphase flow and transport are tightly coupled. To capture this dynamic interplay, fully implicit methods, also known as monolithic approaches, are usually preferred. However, this requires solution of large linear systems that result from the discretization and linearization of the governing balance equations. Such systems are non-symmetric, indefinite, and highly ill-conditioned, which make them difficult to solve. These problems become even more challenging when the flow is coupled to mechanical processes such as rock fracture and deformation. Thus, designing preconditioners that can handle the couplings between different physics is critical for fast convergence. Furthermore, the emergence of new HPC hardware with accelerators, such as GPUs, provide opportunities to further improve the performance of the solution process, when adequately exploited. This work will present our efforts to develop scalable linear solver strategies for subsurface flow applications, designed to be efficient on modern HPC systems. We present a framework based on multigrid reduction (MGR) that is suited for tightly coupled systems of PDEs and demonstrate its applicability to handle challenging problems from multiphase flow applications. We show that the framework is flexible to accommodate a wide range of scenarios, as well as efficient and scalable for large problems on state-of-the-art HPC architectures.

This model requires the solution of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) describing conservation of mass, momentum, and thermal energy, along with various reduced forms of Maxwellâ€™s equations for the electromagnetic fields. The resulting systems are characterized by strong nonlinear and nonsymmetric coupling of fluid and electromagnetic phenomena, as well as the significant range of time- and length-scales that these interactions produce. These characteristics make scalable and efficient iterative solution, of the resulting poorly-conditioned discrete systems, extremely difficult. In this talk we consider the use of block preconditioners for solving the coupled physics block systems.    
The block preconditioner considered here is based on an approximate operator splitting approach which can isolate certain coupled systems, allowing them to be handled independently. Here we use the splitting to create two independent 2x2 block systems, a magnetics-flow system and a magnetics-constraint system.    
We demonstrate this approach for various resistive MHD problems that are relevant to magnetic confinement fusion applications and compare the performance with alternative preconditioning methods.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75293' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk265' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(265)' class='star'><span class='star265'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (E101)</b> Viktoria Mayer, How to Recover from Node Failures in s-step Conjugate Gradient Methods <span id='bitlink-247'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(247)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-247' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(247)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>How to Recover from Node Failures in s-step Conjugate Gradient Methods</b><br />Viktoria Mayer<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-58.html'>Scalable and Efficient Linear Solvers for Large Real-World Applications</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>With the massive growth of concurrency in large-scale computer systems, global communication becomes a major bottleneck and the likelihood of component failures increases. The Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method is an iterative solver for large sparse linear systems facing these challenges. To reduce the number of global synchronizations by a factor of O(s), communication-avoiding s-step PCG methods compute the iterations of PCG in blocks of s.    
Our focus is on resilience against node failures, for which the commonly used approach is periodically saving the state of the solver (Checkpoint-Restart). Other approaches exploit algorithm-specific properties to achieve scalable resilience on large-scale parallel computers. During the failure-free phase of resilient PCG, a small part of the stateâ€™s data can be stored redundantly by exploiting the inherent data redundancy in each iteration. In the event of node failures, the lost parts of the state are recovered using an exact state reconstruction (ESR) strategy after retrieving this redundantly stored data.    
We incorporate resilience against multiple node failures in two s-step PCG methods using ESR ideas and illustrate very low overhead compared to the non-resilient methods. By providing theoretical and experimental evaluations, we confirm that the communication-avoiding properties and therefore scalability of the s-step PCG methods are preserved.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75293' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

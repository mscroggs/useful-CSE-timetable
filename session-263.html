VORO++ was released in 2009 and is based on computing the Voronoi cell for each particle individually. Here, we take advantage of modern computer hardware, and extend the original serial version to allow for multithreaded computation of Voronoi cells via the OpenMP application programming interface. We test the performance of the code, and demonstrate that we can achieve parallel efficiencies greater than 95% in many cases. The multithreaded extension follows standard OpenMP programming paradigms, allowing it to be incorporated into other programs. We provide an example of this using the VoroTop software library, performing a multithreaded Voronoi cell topology analysis of up to 102.4 million particles.

It was presented in SIGGRAPH 2020. We present a recent variation, VoroCrust-T, to generate conforming sliver-free tetrahedral meshes with guaranteed quality.  Our novel approach utilizes the foundational sphere packing methods in VoroCrust which simultaneously generates a quality triangular mesh of the surface of the input Piecewise Linear Complex (PLC) model and decomposes the enclosed volume by weighted Delaunay simplices with good angles conforming to the surface mesh. VoroCrust has an embedded sizing function that capture the curvature of the model, and robustly represents sharp features and narrow regions that might be associated with the input model. Our new variation VoroCrust-T, similar to VoroCrust, can also handle non-manifold and non-watertight inputs. We illustrate the robustness and output quality of VoroCrust through a collection of models of varying complexity. In this talk we also present the recently released VoroCrust software and discuss its performance in practice.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75601' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1197' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1197)' class='star'><span class='star1197'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (G106)</b> Maciej Haranczyk, Geometry and Topology Analysis of Characterization and Discovery of Porous Material Structures <span id='bitlink-1108'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1108)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1108' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1108)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Geometry and Topology Analysis of Characterization and Discovery of Porous Material Structures</b><br />Maciej Haranczyk<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-263.html'>Computational Geometrical and Topological Tools and Their Applications</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Nanoporous materials such have been of growing importance as materials for adsorption-based applications such as CO2 capture, hydrogen and methane storage, as well as for many others applications, for example, as catalysts. A vast majority of nanoporous materials are based on modular chemistry, which enables construction of chemical structures using various building blocks. As the result, a huge number of material structures can be obtained. Novel tools are required to sieve through these possible structures to identify ones with the desired properties for a given application. Our group has been developing such tools by exploiting computational geometry and topology approaches such as Voronoi tessellation and persistence homology. We have gained the ability to detect and characterize porosity features across various length scales important for adsorption processes, and we successfully used these features to build machine learning structure-property models. This presentation will summarize these developments and hint towards new applications in the analysis of porous material structures.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75601' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1198' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1198)' class='star'><span class='star1198'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (G106)</b> Deborah Schwarcz, Mapping the Structural Landscapes of Ordered and Disordered Particle Systems Through Voronoi Topology <span id='bitlink-1109'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1109)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1109' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1109)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Mapping the Structural Landscapes of Ordered and Disordered Particle Systems Through Voronoi Topology</b><br />Deborah Schwarcz<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-263.html'>Computational Geometrical and Topological Tools and Their Applications</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Group theory provides a clear method of classifying crystalline structures according to their symmetry groups, though doesn't provide direct insight into relationships between different systems.  Likewise, although there is great understanding of many different kinds of disordered particle systems, and although many tools provide some insight into similarities and differences between them, no unified setting exists for describing relationships between different kinds of disorder.  We show that Voronoi topology can be used to map out the structural landscape of both ordered and disordered systems by considering the distributions of Voronoi cell topologies that can arise in the different systems.  This approach provides a new way to think about structural relationships between particle systems, ordered and disordered.  A new multithreaded version of VoroTop is used to analyze a large database of materials.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75601' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1199' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1199)' class='star'><span class='star1199'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM (G106)</b> Gunay Dogan, An Algorithm to Mesh 2D Regions in Segmented Images <span id='bitlink-1110'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1110)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1110' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1110)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Algorithm to Mesh 2D Regions in Segmented Images</b><br />Gunay Dogan<br />Thursday, March 2 3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-263.html'>Computational Geometrical and Topological Tools and Their Applications</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Certain applications in medicine, material science, engineering require creating meshes of the structures defined by their segmented regions in images. These meshes can then be used to compute high fidelity simulations of associated physics with the finite element method. In this work, we develop a practical algorithm to create high quality triangulations of regions in segmented images. For this, we identify the boundaries between labeled pixels of the image, smooth and coarsen the boundaries, and use them to guide the triangulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm with several real images from material science.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75601' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

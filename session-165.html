An example being optimal sensor placement for parameter identification. This formulation generally overlooks misspecification of the elements of the inverse problem such as the prior or the measurement uncertainties. In this talk, we present efficient recipes for designing optimal experimental design schemes, for Bayesian inverse problems, such that the optimal design is robust with respect to misspecification of elements of the inverse problem.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75461' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk754' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(754)' class='star'><span class='star754'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (D508)</b> Nada Cvetkovic, Experimental Design in the Presence of Model Error <span id='bitlink-701'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(701)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-701' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(701)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Experimental Design in the Presence of Model Error</b><br />Nada Cvetkovic<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-165.html'>Recent Advances in Optimal Experimental Design for Large-Scale Inverse Problems</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>Solving inverse problems for model calibration of parametrized models plays an important role in predictive modelling and relies on the availability of informative data. Optimal experimental design techniques are devised to guide the data acquisition in a way that maximizes the information content in the data about the parameter which is the object of the inversion. In the presence of model error, data additionally must be informative of the model error in order to be able to correct the model and improve model’s predictive power.    
In this talk we present different approaches for treating the model error which exist in the literature on Bayesian inference and optimal experimental design. By applying Lipschitz stability results for Bayesian inverse problems we compare the posterior distributions of the presented approaches with the posterior obtained when the model error is ignored. In this way we are able to quantify the effect of including the model error. Furthermore, we are able to characterize the properties of the observation operator that increase the information content in the data about the model error, thereby increasing the model’s predictive power.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75461' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk755' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(755)' class='star'><span class='star755'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (D508)</b> Omar Ghattas, Geometric Deep Neural Operators for PDE-Constrained Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design <span id='bitlink-702'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(702)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-702' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(702)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Geometric Deep Neural Operators for PDE-Constrained Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design</b><br />Omar Ghattas<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-165.html'>Recent Advances in Optimal Experimental Design for Large-Scale Inverse Problems</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) problems governed by  PDEs in high or infinite  parameter dimensions are often intractable.  Efficient evaluation of  the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map, which involves solution of the  forward model, is key to making BOED problems tractable. Surrogate  approximations of PtO maps can greatly accelerate  solution of BOED problems, provided an accurate surrogate can be  trained with modest numbers of model solves.  Unfortunately,  constructing such surrogates presents significant challenges when the  parameter dimension is high and the forward model is expensive.    
Deep neural network surrogates of PtO maps, also known as neural  operators, have emerged as leading contenders for overcoming these  challenges. Black box application of DNNs for  problems with infinite dimensional parameter fields leads to poor  results when training data are limited. However, by constructing a network architecture that exploits  the geometry of the PtO map---in particular its smoothness,  anisotropy, and intrinsic low-dimensionality as revealed through  adjoint-PDE-based Gauss-Newton Hessians, one can construct a  dimension-independent geometric neural operator with superior  generalization properties using only limited training data. We employ  this neural operator to make tractable the BOED problem of finding  sensor locations that maximize the expected information gain from the  data, and demonstrate on an inverse wave scattering problem.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75461' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk756' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(756)' class='star'><span class='star756'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (D508)</b> Georg Stadler, Optimal Design of Experiments in Models with Uncertainties <span id='bitlink-703'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(703)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-703' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(703)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimal Design of Experiments in Models with Uncertainties</b><br />Georg Stadler<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-165.html'>Recent Advances in Optimal Experimental Design for Large-Scale Inverse Problems</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>This talk will discuss optimal design of experiments for Bayesian inverse problems governed by uncertain models. When the model uncertainty is irreducible, this amounts to an optimal design problem under uncertainty. When the uncertainty is reducible (i.e., it can be reduced through data), this becomes a probability marginalization problem. I will discuss the differences between these formulation and present numerical examples.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75461' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk757' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(757)' class='star'><span class='star757'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM (D508)</b> Yury A.

Approximately 1 in 4 people will suffer from a mental disorder throughout their lives and between 35% and 50% will receive inadequate treatment, causing up to 800,000 suicides each year. Minimising the time that elapses between the appearance of the first symptoms and the application of the treatment is key to recovery, as it can reduce the severity of the pathology or even slow down its development. In adolescents, especially, if symptoms are not detected and treated in time, it could persist in the adult stage in more severe forms. Each person has different symptomatology and emotional state changes can be suddenly triggered by endogenous and/or exogenous factors, which makes detecting symptoms challenging. One common symptom for many mental illnesses is significant changes in sleep patterns, such as inability to fall asleep, to stay awake, or to get up in the morning. The main objective of this research is to characterize the emotional state of each person in order to predict future changes by analysing their sleeping activity. With that aim, this research presents a mathematical model that allows the characterization of a personalized emotional state.  The data used by the model are collected in real time by an alternative and non-intrusive sleep monitoring system that works without the need of supervision or intervention from the monitored person, guaranteeing thus that the data are reliable

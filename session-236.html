While various model- and learning-based approaches have been proposed to address these challenges, they broadly lack generalizability to different control tasks, rarely preserve the structure of the dynamics, and are unable to tractably bridge the gap between having accurate, but low-dimensional models. In this work, we propose a new, data-driven approach for extracting low-dimensional models from data using Spectral Submanifold Reduction (SSMR).  In contrast to other data-driven methods which fit dynamical models to training trajectories, we identify the dynamics on generic, low-dimensional attractors embedded in the full phase space of the robotic system. This allows us to obtain computationally-tractable models for control which preserve the system's dominant dynamics and better track trajectories radically different from the training data. We demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability of SSMR in dynamic trajectory tracking tasks vis-Ã -vis the state of the art, including Koopman operator-based approaches.

This process is computationally cumbersome, even more so when dealing with nonlinearities due to large deformations. On top of this, as MEMS production processes lead to considerable geometric imperfections, the performance spread of each device must be assessed during the design phase. A popular way to do so is the Monte Carlo method, but it requires thousands of simulations. To alleviate the computational burden of these repeated nonlinear analyses, not be feasible in practice, we recently developed a parametric ROM for shape defects in the geometry. Using the Harmonic Balance method (HB), we were able to compute Frequency Response Curves (FRC) in the matter of minutes. However, even if way more efficient than running the full order model, repeating these simulations thousands of times is still unacceptable. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a HB Sensitivity Analysis, which approximates the nominal solution (i.e. without defects) with a Taylor series. This way, after the nominal solution and the sensitivities are computed, the FRC for each new parameter realization will be given simply through an update. Different strategies to achieve this goal are discussed on a simple nonlinear oscillator, with special care for the closure equation required for the well-posedness of the problem. Finally, the computational benefits of the method are assessed on a FE model of a MEMS device.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75559' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1076' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1076)' class='star'><span class='star1076'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM (G109)</b> Joshua Barnett, Piecewise Quadratic Approximation Manifold for Nonlinear Projection-Based Model Order Reduction <span id='bitlink-992'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(992)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-992' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(992)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Piecewise Quadratic Approximation Manifold for Nonlinear Projection-Based Model Order Reduction</b><br />Joshua Barnett<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-236.html'>Recent Advances in Nonlinear Model Reduction for Computational Mechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>A piecewise quadratic approximation manifold is proposed for mitigating the Kolmogorov barrier to projection-based model order reduction (PMOR). After the computed solution snapshots are clustered, each local model is trained in two steps using an approach that builds on the data-driven procedure underlying the construction of traditional (affine) projection-based reduced order models (PROMs). The overall approach is application-independent and linearization-free. Consequently, it is more robust than alternative approaches for the solution of highly nonlinear problems. If for a convection-dominated turbulent flow problem a PMOR method equipped with the traditional piecewise-affine approximation delivers a certain level of accuracy using a local PROM of average  dimension $n$, the proposed PMOR approach produces a piecewise quadratic PROM that delivers a similar level of accuracy using however an average local dimension of roughly $\sqrt{2n}$. It is shown that when implemented within the least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) PMOR method and equipped with the energy conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) hyperreduction method, the proposed piecewise quadratic approximation manifold accelerates the solution of a benchmark turbulent flow problem by more than four orders of magnitude. It also accelerates the solution of such a problem using a traditional PROM by two orders of magnitude.

Model reduction techniques based in rigorous dynamical systems theory aim to reduce such nonlinear systems over low-dimensional, attracting invariant manifolds. The low-dimensional dynamics of these invariant manifolds acts as a mathematically exact reduced-order model for the full, high-dimensional system. In particular, the recent theory of Spectral Submanifolds (SSM) allows for such a rigorous model reduction and leads to reliable steady-state response predictions within feasible computation times. Further developments have made the direct computation of such invariant manifolds and their reduced dynamics scalable to realistic, nonlinear finite-element models.    
In this talk, we review the basics of SSM theory and computation. We demonstrate applications of SSM-based reduced-order models towards the extraction of nonlinear forced response curves in realistic finite-element models of mechanical systems.

The varying contact conditions at the large frictional contact area, which can highly depend on the pretension, inevitably change the properties of joints. Consequently, the dynamic behavior of the system is influenced and it is desirable to predict and assess these influences from a design point of view. However, commonly used finite element models can result in large sizes for complex systems while the contact mechanism requires complicated time-domain iterative solvers, making the computation time-consuming. Therefore, a parametric model order reduction strategy is proposed for the efficient simulation of bolted structures with changes in pretension. This strategy uses a Craig-Bampton rationale, in which the second-order Krylov subspace is applied for reduction and parameterization for pretension. Due to the large dimension of contact surfaces, the contact surface reduction is applied based on the combination of characteristic constraint modes and joint interface modes. To compute the time-domain dynamics of the reduced model, the dual loop contact algorithm for the augmented Lagrange multiplier method in conjunction with Newmark method is employed. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed reduction method is illustrated by the time domain displacements and detailed contact conditions of a proof-of-concept bolted structure under different pretensions.

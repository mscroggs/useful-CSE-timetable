<h2>ECMI: Perspectives and Successes of Mathematical Challenges in Industrial Applications  - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1597' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1597)' class='star'><span class='star1597'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM (Emerald Room)</b> Alessandra Micheletti, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators: a Mathematical Tool for Explainable Artificial Intelligence <span id='bitlink-1465'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1465)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1465' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1465)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators: a Mathematical Tool for Explainable Artificial Intelligence</b><br />Alessandra Micheletti<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-353.html'>ECMI: Perspectives and Successes of Mathematical Challenges in Industrial Applications  - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Recently the topic of explainability of Artificial Intelligence has been gaining increasing interest from a large part of the scientific community. First, this is due to the desire to investigate the mechanisms of Artificial Intelligence more thoroughly, to better understand its core functioning, so that anomalies, unexpected behaviors and even counterfeits can be prevented. Second, the interest is in part encouraged by the demands of policymakers, who demand techniques that can be understood by humans and relied upon for public decision-making, not only for excellent results but also for inherent transparency.   In this context Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have been developed to establish a mathematical theory of information processing agents. GENEOs are understood as the mathematical formulation of agents who act on the data, and give an opinion. Equivariance is indeed the key property of GENEOs, since it guarantees to filter out the data information that is not relevant for the problem in focus.  In this talk we will introduce GENEOs and describe how they have been successfully employed to face some industrial problems, in the field of medicinal chemistry, implants inspection and maintenance and materials science.

Climate change and ever increasing competition have produced serious challenges for potato breeding, cultivation and processing industries. Of course, this holds for other areas of horticulture and for agriculture, in general, as well. Although agriculture was among the earliest applications of statistics and experimental design, these new challenges often require novel mathematical approaches. For example, large throughput phenotyping is a well-known application for modern image processing meth-ods.  In this talk we discuss mathematical and computational problems that arose during our participation in a series of potato-industry-driven projects and share our solutions. We focus on the problems of spatial and temporal effect removal in field trials and on over-parameterized machine learning of predictive models for cultivation and breeding. In both cases one needs to recover a piecewise smooth function of either several or extremely many variables from poorly structured and sparse data.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75779' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1599' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1599)' class='star'><span class='star1599'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM (Emerald Room)</b> Dietmar Hoemberg, Two-Scale Topology Optimization for 3D Printing <span id='bitlink-1467'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1467)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1467' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1467)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Two-Scale Topology Optimization for 3D Printing</b><br />Dietmar Hoemberg<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-353.html'>ECMI: Perspectives and Successes of Mathematical Challenges in Industrial Applications  - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Subject of my presentation is a novel approach for optimizing both the macroscopic shape and the porous mesoscopic structure of components. The key feature is the introduction of an additional local volume constraint (LVC), which allows to adjust the desired spatial scales. The main novelty is that the radius of the LVC may depend both on space and a local stress measure. This allows for creating optimal topologies with heterogeneous mesostructures enforcing any desired spatial grading and accommodating stress concentrations by stress dependent pore size. I will present some analytical results for the resulting optimal control problem and conclude with numerical simulations showing the  versatility of our approach for creating optimal macroscopic designs with tailored mesostructures.

Therein, a noisy version of the cost function’s gradient is utilized as a search direction, where the noise originates, e.g., due to data sampling. There have been several recent studies showing that the gradient noise that arises in many scenarios, e.g., when training deep learning models, is heavy-tailed. In distributed environments, an additional source of heavy-tailed noise is the imperfect communication between different computing units, e.g., nodes in a wireless sensor network. In this context, we develop both centralized and distributed SGD-type algorithms that provably work in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient and/or communication noises. The methods are based on introducing a generic nonlinearity in the iterate updates in order to combat the noise. We provide for the methods strong convergence and convergence rate guarantees, including almost sure, mean square rate, and asymptotic normality, in a challenging heavy-tailed setting, when noises are of infinite variance. We present the analysis for two different settings: 1) centralized SGD algorithms that provably work under heavy-tailed gradient noise and generic cost functions; and 2) distributed algorithms for stochastic quadratic costs (corresponding to a distributed estimation scenario) that provably work under heavy-tailed gradient and/or communication noises.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75779' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

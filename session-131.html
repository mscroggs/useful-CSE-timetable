<h2>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk596' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(596)' class='star'><span class='star596'>&star;</span></a> <b>1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM (G106)</b> Magnus Svard, A Convergent Finite-Volume Scheme for an Alternative Navier-Stokes System <span id='bitlink-554'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(554)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-554' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(554)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Convergent Finite-Volume Scheme for an Alternative Navier-Stokes System</b><br />Magnus Svard<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-131.html'>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>The ultimate target for any numerical scheme aspiring to solve a PDE is convergence. That is, by refining the grid, ever more accurate approximate solutions are obtained. This property is the sole guarantee that a numerical solution can be trusted to track the true solution. For consistent approximations of linear PDEs, the celebrated Lax-Richtmyer Theorem, states the equivalence of stability, e.g. a single $L^2$ bound, and convergence.    
One may nurture the hope that a non-linear bound, such as a bounded entropy, has the same effect for non-linear conservation laws. Unfortunately, this is generally not the case. In this talk, I will discuss why proving convergence (to any reasonably defined solution) for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is such a challenging problem and show that it is a consequence of the derivation of the equations. Drawing from these insights, I will present an alternative Navier-Stokes model with the same modelling capabilities as the standard Navier-Stokes system (and point to references where it has been validated). Furthermore, and without any a priori stability assumptions, I will outline a proof showing that the numerical solutions to a finite-volume scheme converges to a weak solution. That is, I will have demonstrated the existence of weak solutions to the alternative Navier-Stokes system. Finally, I will show some numerical results produced by the scheme.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75419' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk597' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(597)' class='star'><span class='star597'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (G106)</b> Gianmarco Mengaldo, Spectral/hp Element Methods for Industry: Some Challenges on the Way <span id='bitlink-555'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(555)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-555' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(555)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Spectral/hp Element Methods for Industry: Some Challenges on the Way</b><br />Gianmarco Mengaldo<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-131.html'>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>We present the evolution of spectral/hp element methods over the past several years, and their recent successful deployment to industrial problems. To this end, we present some of the milestones that we developed to achieve this result, from high-order mesh generation to numerical stability, robustness, and computational efficiency. We then present the success story of the high-fidelity Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of a real automotive car, namely the Elemental Rp1 model. The simulation presents the common challenges of an industry-relevant simulation, namely high Reynolds number and complex geometry.

In search of a more efficient entropy conservative scheme, we investigate and analyze properties of a discretization based on the idea of entropy-splitting. The main ingredients of the scheme are Harten's entropy functions, diagonal-E summation-by-parts operator with diagonal norm matrix, and entropy conservative or stable simultaneous approximation terms (SATs). We show that the scheme is high-order accurate and entropy conservative on general curvilinear unstructured grids for the Euler equations. In the special cases of constant density or zero heat conductivity, the scheme remains entropy stable for the Navier-Stokes equations if appropriate viscous SATs are used. Due to the splitting of the inviscid fluxes, the method is not conservative in the sense of Lax-Wendroff. To mitigate the effects of this loss of conservation, we propose a strategy to enforce local conservation in the vicinity of discontinuities without loss of entropy stability. To support the theoretical findings, several numerical investigations involving both smooth and discontinuous solutions are presented. Preliminary efficiency comparison studies in terms of the time required to compute the spatial residual terms are also included.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75419' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk599' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(599)' class='star'><span class='star599'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (G106)</b> Matteo Parsani, On the Robustness of Time Integration Schemes Coupled with Adaptive High-Order Spatial Discretizations with the Sbp Property <span id='bitlink-557'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(557)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-557' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(557)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On the Robustness of Time Integration Schemes Coupled with Adaptive High-Order Spatial Discretizations with the Sbp Property</b><br />Matteo Parsani<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-131.html'>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>We report the performance of explicitly Runge--Kutta schemes that are equipped with time step adaptivity and possibly coupled with the relaxation procedure to achieve entropy stability for computational fluid dynamics.

RONS is a framework to build reduced-order models for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), where the reduced-order solution depends nonlinearly on time-varying parameters. With RONS we obtain an explicit set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to evolve the parameters. These ODEs minimize the instantaneous error between dynamics of the governing PDE and dynamics of the reduced-order solution. Additionally, conserved quantities of the PDE are easily enforced in the reduced solution using the RONS framework. For a reduced-order model with $n$ parameters, naive calculation of ODEs produced by RONS requires evaluating $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ integrals. By exploiting the structure of the RONS equations and using symbolic computation, we reduce the computational cost to $\mathcal{O}(K^2)$ where $K \ll n$. With this approach we apply RONS to problems which require many parameters in the reduced-solution, including simulation of vortex dynamics in turbulent fluid flow and the Fokker-Planck equation in high dimensions.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75419' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

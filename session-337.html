A low-order continuous linear differential system is learned from snapshot solutions of a high-fidelity (HF) solver. The reduced-order model uses different ingredients, such as proper orthogonal decomposition, dynamic mode decomposition and Tikhonov-based robust identification techniques. An interpolation method is used to predict the capsule dynamics for any values of the governing non-dimensional parameters that are not in the training database. Then a dynamical system is built from the predicted solution. Numerical evidence shows the ability of the reduced model to predict the time evolution of the capsule deformation from its initial state, whatever the parameter values. Accuracy and stability properties of the resulting low-order dynamical system are analysed numerically.  The numerical experiments show very good agreement, measured in terms of modified Hausdorff distance between capsule solutions of the full-order and low-order models, in the case of both confined and unconfined flows. This work is a first milestone to move towards real-time simulation of fluid–structure problems, which can be extended to nonlinear low-order systems to account for strong material and flow nonlinearities. We believe that is a valuable innovative approach for deriving an efficient digital twin in this particular context.

The democratization of deep learning capabilities has contributed to a wealth of applications in various fields of our society. Data scientists have used this new instrument to become magicians for the experts in industry for which the first-time-right design of new products and the efficient operation of their manufacturing plants has become more and more complex.  Digital Twins on the other hand have become a generic name for everything that can help the product developer or manufacturing owner to simulate the complex behavior of product or process and optimize it using a virtual variant, allowing to evaluate a much larger space of possible solutions. The challenge however, is that the creation of such advanced digital twins requires expertise which is not easily available.  In this session the author will show through a series of examples how AI is used to capture the experience of the engineers in product development and accelerate the product development process. More-over, through AI, the usage of digital twins can be facilitated beyond product development and support plant operators to optimize manufacturing for reduced energy, improved quality and reduced waste. Finally the session will give an outlook on the availability for low-code AI solutions will make its usage also available to engineers and not just limits it to the data scientists of this world.

The only geometrical input for $\phi$-FEM is a level-set function of the domain. In this talk, we shall present a combination of $\phi$-FEM with the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) allowing for real-time predictions to be computed on any shape, with the ultimate goal of creating digital twins of human organs. We recall that CNN require a particular topological structure, in the form of a regular 2D or 3D grid. In themselves, they  are well suited for e.g. processing images. However, in our application domain, where the governing equations should be solved on domains reproducing the geometries of real organs to train the network, the requirement of a structured mesh is challenging for traditional finite element solvers. In this context, $\phi$-FEM turns out to be a promising alternative for training a CNN to provide predictions under the varying applied forces and under the varying geometries, conveniently represented by level sets that can be acquired from the medical images.

The formulation is designed to overcome the slow decay of the Kolmogorov n-width in the presence of parameter-dependent discontinuities. The key ingredients are as follows. The first ingredient is the nonlinear approximation spaces; to construct the spaces, we transform, for each solution snapshot, the underlying mesh to transport the snapshot such that the shocks are aligned and then apply proper orthogonal decomposition. The second ingredient is the Galerkin projection accelerated by point-wise reduced-quadrature rule constructed using the empirical quadrature procedure, which enables efficient reduced-residual evaluation. The third ingredient is the goal-oriented error estimate based on the dual-weighted residual method, which provides an online-efficient and quantitative estimate of the reduced model error for any parameter value. We demonstrate the formulation using transonic aerodynamic flows with parameter-dependent shocks.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75409' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk554' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(554)' class='star'><span class='star554'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM (E103)</b> Matthew J.

The linear space is constructed using the method of snapshots and POD; prior to compression, each snapshot is composed with a mapping that causes its local features to align (same spatial location) with the corresponding features in all other snapshots. The parametrized domain mapping is chosen such that the local features present in the linear space deform to the corresponding features in the solution being approximated, effectively removing the convection-dominated nature of the problem. The domain mapping is determined implicitly through the solution of a residual minimization problem, rather than relying on explicit sensing/detection.  We provide several numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectivity of the proposed method for high-speed aerodynamic flows.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75409' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk555' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(555)' class='star'><span class='star555'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM (E103)</b> Henrik Rosenberger, Energy-Stable ROM-Based Closure Modelling <span id='bitlink-514'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(514)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-514' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(514)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Energy-Stable ROM-Based Closure Modelling</b><br />Henrik Rosenberger<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-121.html'>Model Order Reduction Methods for Parameterized Fluid Flows - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>We propose a ROM-based closure model for turbulent flow that conserves the total kinetic energy.    
For this purpose, we start by considering an energy-conserving DNS discretization which is too expensive to be used in multi-query applications. To reduce the computational cost, we introduce a discrete filter matrix. Applying this discrete filter to the DNS velocity vector, we get a discretely filtered velocity vector with significantly smaller dimension. The information that is lost in this filtering process we call subgrid velocity.     
When simulating the dynamics of the filtered velocity, we cannot neglect the effects of the subgrid velocity. To take these subgrid effects into account, we approximate the subgrid velocity within a reduced basis. We obtain this reduced basis via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of subgrid velocity snapshots.     
The resulting model consists of the filtered velocity and the approximated subgrid velocity and has a significantly smaller dimension than the DNS model. In contrast to classical model order reduction, we do not aim at reproducing the complete dynamics of the DNS model but only the filtered velocity.    
By preserving the structure of the underlying DNS discretization, we guarantee the proposed reduced order model to be energy-conserving and hence Lyapunov-stable.

The complexity of the design of WEC farms is mainly related to the large areas that multiple devices cover and the multi-scale character of the hydrodynamics involved.   Numerical simulations completely based on high-fidelity models, like the CFD, are accurate but prohibitive in terms of computational cost. To overcome this limitation, a Galerkin Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) Reduced Order Model (ROM) is presented for a bi-fluid application.  Furthermore, for a proper, yet computationally efficient, treatment of the different dynamical features present in a WEC farm, a methodology is proposed coupling the CFD for the fluid-structure interaction around the device, and a Galerkin-free POD ROM for the wave propagation in the far-field. The significant drop in the computational cost of the numerical simulation of wave energy converter farms permitted by this versatile coupling methodology facilitates the design process.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75409' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

They are, however, difficult to achieve simultaneously, since they often require contradictory implementation strategies. In this talk, we will discuss how the Julia programming language can help to overcome some of the typical challenges that arise when trying to develop a high-performance research code that can be easily used and extended by other scientists. We will demonstrate how Trixi.jl, an adaptive high-order numerical simulation package for conservation laws, was designed as a software library with modular components, but with the necessary infrastructure code to make it usable as a standalone framework. The code extensibility afforded by the multiple dispatch mechanism of the Julia language is leveraged to attain high-performance implementations without having to sacrifice accessibility for new users. Finally, we will show how the seamless interoperability with C libraries allows us to scale our Julia code to thousands of cores.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75232' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk109' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(109)' class='star'><span class='star109'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (G105)</b> Leandro Mart&#237;nez, High Performance Particle Simulations and Simulation Analysis Tools with CELLLISTMAP.JL <span id='bitlink-104'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(104)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-104' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(104)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High Performance Particle Simulations and Simulation Analysis Tools with CELLLISTMAP.JL</b><br />Leandro Mart&#237;nez<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-24.html'>Research Software Engineering with Julia - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>N-body simulations and trajectory analysis rely on the calculation of attributes that depend on pairwise particle distances within a cutoff. Interparticle potential energies, forces, distribution functions, neighbor lists, and distance-dependent distributions, for example, must be calculated. Cell lists are widely used to avoid computing distances outside the cutoff. However, efficient cell list implementations are difficult to customize. Here, we provide a fast and parallel implementation of cell lists in Julia that allows the mapping of custom functions dependent on particle positions in 2 or 3 dimensions. Arbitrary periodic boundary conditions are supported. Automatic differentiation and unit propagation can be used. The implementation provides a framework for the development of new analysis tools and simulations with custom potentials. The performance of resulting computations is comparable to state-of-the-art implementations of neighbor list algorithms and cell lists, available in specialized software. Examples are provided for the computation of potential energies, forces, distribution of pairwise velocities, neighbor lists and other typical calculations in molecular and astrophysical simulations. The Julia package is freely available at http://m3g.github.io/CellListMap.jl. Interfacing with Python and R with minimal overhead is possible.

The dose distribution is shaped during treatment planning, which is currently a semi-automatic process requiring human planners with years of training and experience. State of the art planning systems provide tools to automate and optimise the treatment planning, but they are inflexible, which makes it hard to incorporate advances and insights from disciplines like machine learning.  We develop a novel treatment planning framework in the Julia programming language. All our computations are performed on graphics processing units, reducing the planning time even further. This allows researchers to write codes that execute quickly, facilitating the transition from research to the clinic. The new planning framework is designed to optimise many quantities simultaneously thanks to the state-of-the art automatic differentiation libraries available in the Julia ecosystem. We adopt a flexible loss-function approach that enables a precise formulation of the treatment goals. The loss function can trivially be extended to include new insights and requirements in a short time, rendering the framework versatile and future-proof.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75232' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk111' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(111)' class='star'><span class='star111'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G105)</b> Valentin Churavy, Tackling Application Portability in Julia <span id='bitlink-105'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(105)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-105' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(105)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tackling Application Portability in Julia</b><br />Valentin Churavy<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-24.html'>Research Software Engineering with Julia - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>In research software engineering we face a plethora of hardware (new and old) that are being used to solve scientific problems at many scales. From the researches new laptop, over institutional resources, to national supercomputers. Scientific applications need to be portable across these architectures, but also exploit specific capabilities of the hardware to reach maximum performance.    
The Julia programming language is a high-level programming language used for technical programming (science, engineering, ...) and many scales. It provides capabilities to program a range of accelerators from different vendors, as well as supporting hardware based reduced precision and vectorization.    
In this talk we will explore the interplay between writing general programs that are specialized by the compiler, using examples from computational fluid dynamics. The two focus topics are (1) the challenge of supporting reduced precision and (2) targeting multiple GPU vendors from a single-source program.

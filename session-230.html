However, often non-linear effects are important. To capture non-linear effects, we present a new randomized method for approximating high order derivative tensors with hierarchical tensor networks, which we use to to form high order Taylor series surrogate models. We demonstrate that the method can efficiently construct accurate high order Taylor series surrogate models at low cost. We use the resulting Taylor series surrogate models to accelerate MCMC sampling.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75552' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1050' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1050)' class='star'><span class='star1050'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D502)</b> Fabian Key, Development of Surrogate Models for Uncertainty Quantification in Manufacturing Engineering <span id='bitlink-967'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(967)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-967' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(967)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Development of Surrogate Models for Uncertainty Quantification in Manufacturing Engineering</b><br />Fabian Key<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-230.html'>Accelerating Computational Science and Engineering via Data-Driven Learning and Nonlinear Model Reduction - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>Computer simulations are a widely used tool in computational science and engineering to, e.g., analyze the behavior of components or materials, to enhance manufacturing processes with fast and accurate a-priori forecasts, or even to control those processes during ongoing operation.    
With the help of these tools, we wish to make reliable assertions and predictions for one or more quantity of interests (QoI), also in the presence of uncertainty, e.g., in process conditions, material properties or similar. Thus, methods from the field of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) can enhance the quality of processes and products by augmenting the results for the QoI with quantified probability measures.     
We consider sampling-based UQ methods that usually require a great number of model evaluations. Thus, employing high-fidelity models may easily exceed available resources. Here, the usage of surrogate models, which are computationally cheaper, can provide a remedy. Therefore, we first follow the path of Model Order Reduction (MOR). In particular, we explore the benefits of intrusive MOR techniques and use Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with a subsequent Galerkin projection of the operators onto the constructed subspaces. As an alternative, we also investigate the advantages of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) as a meta model. Finally, the integration of the resulting surrogate models into an UQ setting is demonstrated for applications coming from polymer processing.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75552' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1052' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1052)' class='star'><span class='star1052'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D502)</b> Julia Konrad, Exploring Context-Aware Learning of Low-Fidelity Models for Multi-Fidelity Monte Carlo Sampling in Plasma Micro-Turbulence Analysis <span id='bitlink-968'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(968)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-968' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(968)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Exploring Context-Aware Learning of Low-Fidelity Models for Multi-Fidelity Monte Carlo Sampling in Plasma Micro-Turbulence Analysis</b><br />Julia Konrad<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-230.html'>Accelerating Computational Science and Engineering via Data-Driven Learning and Nonlinear Model Reduction - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>Multi-fidelity Monte Carlo methods leverage hierarchies of high- and low-fidelity models for speeding up the computation of quantities of interest depending on high-fidelity models. However, the low-fidelity models are assumed to be fixed and therefore cannot be refined or improved, which is relevant, e.g, for data-driven models. To this end, the context-aware multi-fidelity Monte Carlo algorithm optimally balances the costs of training low-fidelity models with the sampling costs, which means that it takes into account the context in which the low-fidelity models will be used, i.e., for variance reduction in Monte Carlo estimation. In the original formulation of the algorithm, all low-fidelity models depend on all uncertain inputs. In this work, we use the fact that in many applications only a subset of the inputs is important for the underlying problem, and explore the potential of reduced-dimension low-fidelity models for speeding up computations further. With sensitivity information obtained from a first fully-dimensional context-aware low-fidelity model, we also construct reduced-dimension context-aware low-fidelity models, which only depend on subsets of selected, important uncertain inputs.  We explore this idea in the highly relevant context of quantifying uncertainty in small-scale fluctuations in confined fusion plasmas, which is a problem typically characterized by a large number of uncertain inputs and is therefore challenging to address with conventional methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75552' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1053' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1053)' class='star'><span class='star1053'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D502)</b> Bert J.

While detailed process  models for the uranium degradation in these waste packages are available, they  are too computationally expensive to be used in a comprehensive full-repository  simulation. In this work, we develop Machine Learning surrogate models for the  fuel degradation process models and study their accuracy compared to the  detailed model as a function of how much information from the internal fuel cask  state is incorporated. Both k-Nearest Neigbor regression and Artificial Neural  Networks are considered.

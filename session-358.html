<h2>Reduced-Order Modelling Techniques for Turbulent Reacting Flows</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1619' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1619)' class='star'><span class='star1619'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (E101)</b> Konduri Aditya, Application of Co-Kurtosis Based Reduced Order Models for Combustion Datasets <span id='bitlink-1486'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1486)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1486' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1486)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Application of Co-Kurtosis Based Reduced Order Models for Combustion Datasets</b><br />Konduri Aditya<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-358.html'>Reduced-Order Modelling Techniques for Turbulent Reacting Flows</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a frequently employed dimensionality reduction technique in numerical simulations of combustion processes. However, it could be argued that the co-variance eigenvectors of the thermo-chemical state space used for PCA may be unable to fully capture information about important, extreme-valued localized chemical dynamics like ignition-kernel-formation. In such situations, a useful approach may be to consider a dimensionality reduction procedure where the required principal vectors are computed from high-order joint statistical moments and may enable improved identification of the state space directions corresponding to stiff dynamics. This talk presents one such procedure, namely the co-kurtosis PCA (CoK-PCA), that is based on the fourth-order joint statistical moment i.e. the co-kurtosis tensor. Apriori analysis of combustion datasets corresponding to spontaneous ignition of premixed ethylene-air in a simple homogeneous reactor and ethanol-fueled homogeneous charged compression ignition (HCCI) engine demonstrates that the co-kurtosis based reduced manifold is able to represents the original thermo-chemical state in the regions where chemical reactions are important with significant accuracy.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75785' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1620' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1620)' class='star'><span class='star1620'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (E101)</b> James C.

We achieve a substantial reduction in the number of parameters needed to visualize, describe and predict complex systems, but some topological properties of LDMs can hinder their practical application. For instance, ROMs often require training a nonlinear regression model to predict physical quantities of interest from the reduced representation, and accurate reconstruction of minor species as well as projected source terms (both of which can exhibit large gradients) is challenging. In this talk, we explore the challenges that remain in ROM of turbulent combustion. We focus on the topological issues that the LDMs present. We discuss our recent advances in characterizing manifold quality, generating improved manifold topologies and improving nonlinear regression performance. We demonstrate novel quantitative tools for characterizing the quality of LDMs from the perspective of non-uniqueness and steep gradients in the physical quantities of interest. We show applications of the manifold assessment tools in optimization algorithms that yield improved manifolds. We discuss novel local kernel regression models that achieve better predictive performance than the current state-of-the-art models.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75785' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1621' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1621)' class='star'><span class='star1621'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (E101)</b> Alberto Procacci, Adaptive, Physics-Based Digital Twins of Practical Combustion Systems <span id='bitlink-1488'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1488)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1488' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1488)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive, Physics-Based Digital Twins of Practical Combustion Systems</b><br />Alberto Procacci<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-358.html'>Reduced-Order Modelling Techniques for Turbulent Reacting Flows</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>The combination of simulation and experimental data is key for developing accurate and reliable Reduced Order Models that can serve as digital twins (DT) of practical combustion systems to forecast combustion evolution in real-time and act as soft sensors.  Dimensionality reduction in combination with non-linear regression has proven powerful in building reduced-order models from Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a physics-based digital twin for a furnace operating in flameless combustion conditions, in a wide range of operating conditions deriving from the modification of the equivalence ratio, the air injection velocity (controlling the internal recirculation degree) and the fuel composition (from pure methane to pure hydrogen).  Integrating heterogeneous data streams in the DT development process and continuous improvement is also discussed, using a combination of methodologies based on sparse sensing and data assimilation.

DBO is an on-the-fly low-rank approximation technique, in which the instantaneous composition matrix of the reactive flow field is decomposed into a set of orthonormal spatial modes, a set of orthonormal vectors in the composition space, and a factorization of the low-rank correlation matrix. This approach bypasses the need to solve the full-dimensional set of species transport equations to generate high-fidelity data as is commonly performed in data-driven dimension reduction techniques such as the principal component analysis (PCA). Because of these features, DBO can adapt on-the-fly to intrinsic and externally excited transient changes in state of the transport variables. A demonstration case of DBO-based ROM of reacting transport equations exhibiting strongly transient combustion phenomena including flame propagation, end-gas auto-ignition and developing detonation is presented using a 39-species gasoline surrogate mechanism. A-posteriori comparisons against the data generated via full-rank direct numerical simulation (DNS) as well as the PCA reduction of the DNS data is carried out to highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of the DBO based ROM of compressible reacting flows.

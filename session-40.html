On the other hand, Sobolev smoothing can also be interpreted as an approximation for the shape Hessian. This paper demonstrates, how Sobolev smoothing, interpreted as a shape Hessian approximation, offers considerable benefits, although the parameterization is smooth in itself already. Such an approach is especially beneficial in the context of simultaneous analysis and design, where we deal with inexact flow and adjoint solutions, also called One Shot optimization. Furthermore, the incorporation of the parameterization allows for direct application to engineering test cases, where shapes are always described by a CAD model. The new methodology presented in this paper is used for reference test cases from aerodynamic shape optimization and performance improvements in comparison to a classical Quasi-Newton scheme are shown.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75256' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk185' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(185)' class='star'><span class='star185'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D508)</b> Vijayakumar Muthusamy, Stabilization and Tracking Control Design for Stochastic Fuzzy Systems via Adaptive Event-Triggered Mechanism <span id='bitlink-175'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(175)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-175' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(175)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stabilization and Tracking Control Design for Stochastic Fuzzy Systems via Adaptive Event-Triggered Mechanism</b><br />Vijayakumar Muthusamy<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-40.html'>Advances in Optimal Control and Shape Optimization Concerning Applications in Physics and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>An adaptive event-triggered mechanism-based output tracking control problem for stochastic T-S fuzzy systems with state delay and external disturbance is discussed in this work. An adaptive event-triggered mechanism is developed for the considered system to reduce the number of triggering and communication burdens. Adaptive feedback control is constructed to force the output trajectories to track the bounded reference input signal even in the presence of external disturbance. Further, the tracking control objective transformed into stochastic stabilization of the considered system. For the stabilization analysis, the stochastic fuzzy system does not share the same membership functions as the proposed control.  The sufficient stabilization conditions are developed in the form of linear matrix inequalities together with the help of Lyapunovâ€“Krasovskii functional and some integral inequalities.  Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to some engineering stochastic models to validate efficiency and practicability.

We consider the simulation of a rotating electric machine by means of a space-time finite element method where the rotation is captured by the tetrahedral space-time mesh. We derive the shape derivative for a given cost function with respect to a perturbation of the (spatial) geometry and present a shape optimization algorithm for moving domains in space-time. Here, it is important to note that the optimized geometry is moving, but must not change its shape over time.  Finally, for a realistic simulation, the initial condition of the evolution problem at hand is obtained as the solution to a static PDE on the given geometry and, thus, is shape-dependent as well. Accounting for this aspect yields a shape optimization problem that is constrained by a system of a static and a transient PDE. We show an extension of our sensitivity analysis and shape optimization algorithm to this setting and present numerical results for the optimization of a synchronous reluctance machine.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75256' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk184' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(184)' class='star'><span class='star184'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D508)</b> Estefania Loayza-Romero, Quasi-Newton Methods for Fully Discrete Shape Optimization Problems <span id='bitlink-174'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(174)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-174' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(174)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quasi-Newton Methods for Fully Discrete Shape Optimization Problems</b><br />Estefania Loayza-Romero<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-40.html'>Advances in Optimal Control and Shape Optimization Concerning Applications in Physics and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we will consider fully discrete PDE-constrained shape optimization problems in 2D. These problems are defined on the complete manifold of planar triangular meshes initially proposed in [Herzog, Loayza-Romero, A Manifold of Planar Triangular Meshes with Complete Riemannian Metric, 2020,  https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2012.05624].    
We propose an approximation for the Riemannian parallel transport and logarithm on the manifold of planar triangular meshes based on the discrete geodesic calculus proposed in [Rumpf, Wirth, Variational time discretization of geodesic calculus,2015, doi:10.1093/imanum/dru027].  The approximation of the parallel transport will allow us to propose a Quasi-Newton Method for solving this problem. We will compare the results with the traditional Riemannian steepest descent method and show the acceleration in the convergence.    
Finally, since computing geodesics is too computationally expensive we propose a quality-preserving projection-like retraction obtained by exploiting the features of the manifold of planar triangular meshes as suggested in [Absil, Malik,Projection-like Retractions on Matrix Manifolds,2012, https://doi.org/10.1137/100802529].  We will apply the proposed algorithm to solve compliance problems in structural mechanics.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75256' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

A small-amplitude flow model combined with an efficient Chebyshev PDE solver and conformal mapping techniques enables efficient numerical solutions. These solutions elucidate the performance benefits garnered by optimizing flexibility characteristics of appendages. The method also generalizes to multiple flapping bodies through the so-called prime function. New results shed light on flow-mediated collective behavior, such as schooling and flocking.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75517' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk942' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(942)' class='star'><span class='star942'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D403)</b> Monika Nitsche, Vortex Sheet Simulations of Interacting Flapping Plates <span id='bitlink-868'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(868)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-868' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(868)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Vortex Sheet Simulations of Interacting Flapping Plates</b><br />Monika Nitsche<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-206.html'>Numerical Simulation of Bio-Inspired Fluid-Structure Interaction - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>The motion of several plates in an inviscid and incompressible fluid is studied numerically, the general motivation being to understand the role of hydrodynamic interactions in mediating schooling and flocking behavior in animal collectives. The plates move vertically with a prescribed oscillatory motion and horizontally by their self-induced thrust forces. The trailing vorticity is simulated using a separated vortex sheet model. The fluid motion near the plates is resolved using corrected standard quadratures. The flow is computed for two, three and four in-line plates. New results are obtained for the stability of the equilibrium positions behind the leading plate: as the number of plates increase, and as the oscillation amplitude decreases, the domain of attraction of the equilibria shrinks and the number of unstable trajectories increases. A simple control mechanism to avoid instability is explored.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75517' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk943' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(943)' class='star'><span class='star943'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D403)</b> Shilpa Khatri, Close Evaluation of Layer Potentials <span id='bitlink-869'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(869)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-869' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(869)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Close Evaluation of Layer Potentials</b><br />Shilpa Khatri<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-206.html'>Numerical Simulation of Bio-Inspired Fluid-Structure Interaction - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>To understand the fluid dynamics of complex phenomena, fluid-structure interaction problems must be solved. Challenges exist in developing numerical techniques to solve these complex flow problems with boundary conditions at fluid-structure interfaces. I will present details of a novel method that is being developed to address these challenges. We are looking at accurate evaluation of layer potentials near interfaces. I will present how classical numerical methods are problematic for evaluations close to boundaries and how newly developed numerical methods based on asymptotics can be used to improve accuracy.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75517' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk945' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(945)' class='star'><span class='star945'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D403)</b> Irving Martinez, Steklov-Poincar&#233; Analysis of the Basic Three-Domain Stent Problem <span id='bitlink-871'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(871)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-871' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(871)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Steklov-Poincar&#233; Analysis of the Basic Three-Domain Stent Problem</b><br />Irving Martinez<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-206.html'>Numerical Simulation of Bio-Inspired Fluid-Structure Interaction - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>The Steklov-Poincar√© problem was previously considered in the artery lumen and wall setting with a single interface. Here the analysis is expanded to incorporate solute behavior in the presence of a fixed-volume, solid, simple stent. In this geometry, a third domain is added to the two-domain structure of wall and artery. Through this intersecting domain volume setting there are three interfaces: lumen-wall, stent-lumen, and wall-stent.     
  Steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are used to explain the behavior of blood through the lumen, while advection-diffusion dynamics are considered for the solute mechanics across the lumen, wall, and stent. Having a fixed blood velocity value, Steklov-Poincar\'e decomposition of the advection-diffusion equations is applied locally to each of the interfaces. To unify these instances on a global scale, their overall intersection is explored in a smaller manifold, reducing the problem to one previously solved by Quarteroni, Veneziani, and Zunino.  Through finite element analysis (FEM), the solution is discretized and found to be convergent. Finally, computational simulations of different types of stent of one, three, and five stent rings of different thickness, placed between straight and curved volumes of inner and outer cylindrical meshes, were performed using NGSolve, confirming the convergence of the solution and its relation to the coarseness of the mesh.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75517' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk944' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(944)' class='star'><span class='star944'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (D403)</b> Jose L.

However, the long-time evolution of hydrodynamically interacting collectives is challenging to investigate due to the persistent influence of long-lived vortical structures, and the high-resolution requirements of direct numerical simulation at large Reynolds numbers.   Reduced-order models have therefore played an important role in theoretical investigations.  We introduce a new reduced-order model of swimmers that self-propel by flapping, i.e., executing a prescribed periodic rigid body motion. The model is an extension of a discrete-time dynamical system developed by Oza, Ristroph and Shelley in which flapping swimmers interact through periodically shed vortices.  Our work allows a variable separation distance between swimmers and also describes more faithfully the wing-wing interactions of our dynamical system.  The model is used to investigate conditions under which hydrodynamic interactions lead to stable swimming configurations. Preliminary numerical results are presented.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75517' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

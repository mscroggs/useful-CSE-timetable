Recently, relaxation techniques have been proposed as modifications of standard time integration methods guaranteeing the conservation or dissipation of such secondary quantities of interest. Here, we investigate how to combine these relaxation techniques with efficient step size control mechanisms based on local error estimates. We demonstrate our results in several numerical experiments, focusing on nonlinear dispersive wave equations.

In [Rueda-Ram√≠rez et al., Subcell Limiting Strategies for DGSEM, 2022], the authors presented subcell limiting strategies for DGSEM discretizations of conservation laws based on the combination of finite volume (FV) schemes with DGSEM. However, the multi-component GLM-MHD equations impose two new challenges: (i) they require the use of non-conservative terms for entropy consistency, which adds complexity to the spatial discretization, and (ii) impose positivity constraints for several ion species.    
Our main contribution is the extension of our hybrid FV/DGSEM to non-conservative systems, which requires to write the DGSEM as a flux-differencing formula. To achieve it, we propose a generalization of the telescoping flux formula of Fisher and Carpenter [Fisher and Carpenter, High-order entropy stable finite difference schemes for nonlinear conservation laws: Finite domains, 2013] to account for non-conservative terms. Furthermore, we show that the hybrid FV/DGSEM can be used to impose invariant domain preserving constraints (including positivity of all ion species).    
We test our new strategy to solve problems featuring shocks and turbulence.

Our particular interest is the surface-quasi-geostrophic flow model (SQG), which is a scalar nonlinear conservation law in two space dimensions. The velocity field and the viscosity term of the SQG equation involve calculating the fractional derivative of the solution, which is not trivial to compute numerically. For this purpose, we use Dunford--Taylor representations of fractional operators. Strong-stability-preserving Runge--Kutta methods are used in time and the continuous finite element method is used in space. The method retains the invariant domain property under the usual CFL condition and has a second-order accuracy in space. The method is tested by solving several benchmark problems.    
This work was done in collaboration with Andrea Bonito from Texas A&M University.

For mesh generation, the flow body is cut out of a regular Cartesian grid resulting in so called cut cells. Cut cells can have irregular shape and may be very small. For the solution of time-dependent hyperbolic conservation laws, this causes the small cell problem: explicit time stepping schemes are not stable on the arbitrarily small cut cells.    
In this talk we present the Domain of Dependence (DoD) stabilization for overcoming this issue for DG schemes. The stabilization is based on adding suitable penalty terms to the spatial discretization. In time, one can then use a standard explicit time stepping scheme. The terms are designed to restore proper domains of dependence. The terms are constructed such that the resulting stabilized scheme possesses desirable properties such as being monotone for scalar conservation laws for the first-order version or energy preserving for the semi-discrete scheme for all polynomial degrees. On cut cell meshes, this is a big challenge to guarantee these otherwise `standard' properties. In this talk, we will present the idea behind the DoD stabilization and summarize the latest developments for non-linear problems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75208' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk70' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(70)' class='star'><span class='star70'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (D304)</b> Venkatesh Gopinath, A Data Based Physics-Informed Neural Network Model for Simulation of Two-Dimensional Turbulence <span id='bitlink-67'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(67)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-67' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(67)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Data Based Physics-Informed Neural Network Model for Simulation of Two-Dimensional Turbulence</b><br />Venkatesh Gopinath<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-15.html'>Structure Preserving and Robust Techniques for the Simulation of Transport Phenomena and Fluid Flows - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>Turbulence is a problem yet to be fully understood. It has many industrial applications in domains such as automotive, aerospace, to name a few. Lot of experimental and computational resources are used to characterize and study turbulent flow. With the advent of deep learning, a new method known as Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) has been recently introduced which shows tremendous promise in not only reducing computational costs but could potentially save costs on experiments or measurements, which is a huge advantage. In this work, we will show solutions based on PINN methods to simulate two-dimensional turbulence. PINN is a powerful technique where the governing equation of the system is enforced in the neural network architecture. Along with traditional PINN, we also take a sparse set of training data inside the computational domain. We show two different PINN based neural network architectures and compare them with direct numerical simulation (DNS) results. For Reynolds number of order $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, with the new PINN model which we call as PINN-FF (Fourier filter), we observe a close match in kinetic energy spectra even while using only $0.1 %$ training data. We observe very good match of the large scale structures in comparison with DNS although the small scale structures are yet to be refined. Also, we observe similar results at higher Reynolds numbers of order $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ which ensures robustness of the approach.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75208' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

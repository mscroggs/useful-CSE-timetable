This new system developed in [Koellermeier, J. and Pimentel-García, E.; Steady States and Well-Balanced Schemes for Shallow Water Moment Equations with Topography; Applied Mathematics and Computations; 2022] is a nonconservative hyperbolic system from which we can get some information about its steady state solutions. This is mandatory when using the high-order well-balanced methodology developed in [Castro, M.J., Parés, C.; Well-balanced high-order finite volume methods for systems of balance laws; Journal of Scientific Computing; 2020]. We focus on the first- and second-order schemes and we solve the different difficulties that we find. Some numerical tests are shown in order to verified the well-balanced property of the methods and how they deal when wet-dry fronts appear in the solution.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75510' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk912' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(912)' class='star'><span class='star912'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM (D406)</b> Maurizio Tavelli, Asymptotic Preserving IMEX Schemes for the Shallow Water Equations on Unstructured Meshes <span id='bitlink-839'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(839)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-839' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(839)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Asymptotic Preserving IMEX Schemes for the Shallow Water Equations on Unstructured Meshes</b><br />Maurizio Tavelli<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-200.html'>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part II of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>We propose a novel numerical method for the solution of the shallow water equations in different regimes of the Froude number making use of general polygonal meshes. The fluxes of the governing equations are split such that advection and acoustic-gravity sub-systems are derived, hence separating slow and fast phenomena. This splitting allows the nonlinear convective fluxes to be discretized explicitly in time, while retaining an implicit time marching for the acoustic-gravity terms. Consequently, the novel schemes are particularly well suited in the low Froude limit of the model, since no numerical viscosity is added in the implicit solver. Besides, stability follows from a milder CFL condition which is based only on the advection speed and not on the celerity. High order time accuracy is achieved using the family of semi-implicit IMEX Runge-Kutta schemes, while high order in space is granted relying on two discretizations: (i) a cell-centered finite volume (FV) scheme for the nonlinear convective contribution on the polygonal cells; (ii) a staggered discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the solution of the linear system associated to the implicit discretization of the pressure sub-system. The novel schemes are proved to be Asymptotic Preserving (AP) and well-balanced by construction. Accuracy and robustness are then validated against a set of benchmark test cases with Froude numbers ranging in the interval $\Fr \approx [10^{-6};5]$.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75510' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk913' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(913)' class='star'><span class='star913'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM (D406)</b> Irene G&#243;mez-Bueno, Implicit and Semi-Implicit High-Order Well-Balanced Methods for One-Dimensional Systems of Balance Laws <span id='bitlink-840'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(840)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-840' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(840)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Implicit and Semi-Implicit High-Order Well-Balanced Methods for One-Dimensional Systems of Balance Laws</b><br />Irene G&#243;mez-Bueno<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-200.html'>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part II of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>The goal of this work is to design one-dimensional implicit and semi-implicit high-order well-balanced numerical schemes for general systems of balance laws with stiff numerical flux and/or source term. When the relaxation parameter is very small, the relaxation terms become very strong and highly stiff, and numerical schemes may produce spurious results. The well-balanced reconstruction procedure introduced by two of the authors in some previous work is applied, based on the development of well-balanced reconstruction operators. The well-balanced property is preserved when quadrature formulas are used to approximate the averages and integral of the source term in the cells. This technique is combined with a time discretization method for the time evolution of type RK-IMEX or RK-implicit. The methodology will be applied to several systems of balance laws, such as the Burgers equation or the shallow water equations with Manning friction.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75510' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk914' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(914)' class='star'><span class='star914'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM (D406)</b> Celia Caballero-C&#225;rdenas, A First Approach to the Design of Fully Well-Balanced Lagrange-Projection Schemes for the Shallow Water Model <span id='bitlink-841'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(841)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-841' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(841)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A First Approach to the Design of Fully Well-Balanced Lagrange-Projection Schemes for the Shallow Water Model</b><br />Celia Caballero-C&#225;rdenas<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-200.html'>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part II of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>We will first propose a method to design numerical approximations of the shallow-water equations that are both implicit and exactly well-balanced for water at rest steady states. This is achieved through a two-step process, where the shallow-water system is first solved in Lagrangian coordinates, called the Lagrangian step, and then the results are projected into Eulerian coordinates, called the Projection step. The Lagrangian step can be done implicitly, while the Projection step is always done explicitly. This approach separates the acoustic and the transport phenomena, allowing for larger time steps with restrictions based on slower transport waves instead of acoustic ones. Furthermore, we are currently working on developing implicit fully well-balanced schemes that preserve all the steady states. In this sense, we will also be providing an idea of how to develop explicit fully well-balanced schemes, which will help us accomplish our goal.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75510' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

The theoretical results show convergence of the two-level method independently of the discretization and model parameters.

In this talk, we focus in particular on a model of soluble surfactants involving convection and diffusion. To solve this model problem, we consider unfitted space-time finite element simulations, which come with the benefit of a flexible handling of complex geometries. The overall coupled problem can be decomposed into several components, which can be studied individually first and finally taken together, such as the mere surface and the mere bulk problem. In relation to the important reference work "A cut finite element method for coupled bulk-surface problems on time-depent domains", P. Hansbo, M.G. Larson, S. Zahedi (CMAME 307, 96-116) we present some variant methods for several of these steps. Specifically, we investigate a stabilisation variant which we call direct Ghost penalty stabilisation. Moreover, we study the applicability of the higher order geometry description developed for the merely spatial case in "High order unfitted finite element methods on level set domains using isoparametric mappings", C. Lehrenfeld (CMAME 300, 716-733).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75748' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1540' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1540)' class='star'><span class='star1540'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D404)</b> Simone Pezzuto, Boundary Integral Formulation of the Microscopic Bidomain Model of Cardiac Electrophysiology <span id='bitlink-1414'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1414)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1414' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1414)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Boundary Integral Formulation of the Microscopic Bidomain Model of Cardiac Electrophysiology</b><br />Simone Pezzuto<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-339.html'>High Performance Computing Tools for Mixed Dimensional Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>At microscopic scale, the cardiac tissue is composed by tightly coupled myocytes, embedded into an extracellular matrix and surrounded by other cells.  The microscopic bidomain ($\mu$-bidomain) model is a system of partial differential equations describing the evolution of the electric potential within each cell and in the extracellular space. The model accounts for the cellular membrane dynamics and intercellular coupling. From a numerical perspective, the $\mu$-bidomain model poses a number of difficulties: the cellular subdomains are separated by a sharp interface, that is the cellular membrane; the temporal dynamics is confined on such interfaces; and the membrane dynamics is typically multiscale, nonlinear and very stiff in time.  	  In this work, we first recast the problem to a boundary integral formulation and confine the equations on the cellular membrane, on which the temporal dynamics take place.   	  Then, we present some numerical experiments to compare the boundary integral formulation to a more standard finite element approach. We also discuss the feasibility of the approach towards the application to large scale models.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75748' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1541' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1541)' class='star'><span class='star1541'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D404)</b> Wietse M.

Boon<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-339.html'>High Performance Computing Tools for Mixed Dimensional Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Constructing fast solution schemes often involves deciding which errors are acceptable and which approximations can be made for the sake of computational efficiency. Herein, we consider a mixed formulation of Darcy flow and take the perspective that the physical law of mass conservation is significantly more important than the constitutive relationship, i.e. Darcy's law. Within this point of view, we propose a three-step solution technique that guarantees local mass conservation.    
In the first step, an initial flux field is obtained by using a locally conservative method such as the TPFA Finite Volume Method. Although this scheme is computationally efficient, it lacks consistency and therefore requires a suitable correction. Since this correction is divergence-free, the Helmholtz decomposition ensures that it is given by the curl of a potential field. The second step therefore employs an H(curl)-conforming discretization to compute the correction potential and update the flux field. The pressure field is computed in the final step by using the same TPFA system from the first step.    
The procedure guarantees local mass conservation regardless of the quality of the computed correction. Thus, we relax this computation using tools from reduced order modeling. We introduce a reduced basis method that is capable of rapidly producing a potential field for given permeability fields. By applying the curl to this field, we ensure that the correction is divergence-free and mass conservation is not impacted.    
Finally, we extend the method to solving Darcy flow in fractured porous media. We rewrite the equations in terms of mixed-dimensional differential operators and identify the problem as a mixed-dimensional Darcy flow system. In turn, the proposed three-step solution procedure directly applies using the mixed-dimensional curl to ensure local mass conservation.

Starting from the Newtonian fluid flow through a domain with an array of small holes on the boundary, using the homogenization and the boundary layers, we find an effective law in the form of generalized Darcy law. If the pores geometry is isotropic, then the condition splits in Beavers–Joseph type condition for the tangential flow and the standard Darcy condition for the normal flow.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75748' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

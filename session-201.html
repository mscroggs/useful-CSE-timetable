More precisely, we are interested in one-shot methods, which iterate at the same time on the forward/adjoint problem solution and on the inverse problem unknown. We analyze two variants of the so-called multi-step one-shot methods and establish sufficient conditions on the descent step for their convergence, by studying the eigenvalues of the block matrix of the coupled iterations. We illustrate numerically the convergence of these methods for a Helmholtz inverse problem and compare them with the classical usual and shifted gradient descent methods. In particular, we observe that very few inner iterations on the forward problem are enough to guarantee good convergence of the inversion algorithm.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75511' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk917' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(917)' class='star'><span class='star917'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (G111)</b> Axel Modave, A Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method with Characteristic Variables for Helmholtz Problems <span id='bitlink-843'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(843)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-843' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(843)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method with Characteristic Variables for Helmholtz Problems</b><br />Axel Modave<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-201.html'>Modern Solvers for the Helmholtz and Wave Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>We will present a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method, called CHDG, for solving time-harmonic scalar wave propagation problems. This method relies on a standard discontinuous Galerkin scheme with upwind numerical fluxes. Auxiliary unknowns corresponding to characteristic variables are defined at the interface between the elements, and the physical fields are eliminated to obtain a reduced system. The reduced system can be written as a fixed-point problem that can be solved with stationary iterative schemes. Numerical results with 2D benchmarks will be presented to study the performance of the approach. Compared to the standard HDG approach, the properties of the reduced system are improved with CHDG, which is more suited for iterative solution procedures with e.g. GMRES or CGN.

This type of PDE occurs in several contexts (acoustic flow, Schr√∂dinger equation, Wave-ray method...), and it raises similarly difficulties as the classical Helmholtz equation. Indeed, in the case of constant parameter, one can show that with an appropriate change of variable the PDE can be reformulated as the classical Helmholtz equation. This reformulation allows to get several byproducts, such as the construction of absorbing boundary conditions, a PML formulation, and in particular to apply the Fourier analysis to study the convergence properties of an iterative Schwarz algorithm. In this talk, we will detail the Fourier analysis and emphasise the impact of the boundary conditions to end the computational domain.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75511' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk919' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(919)' class='star'><span class='star919'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G111)</b> Jinqiang Chen, A Matrix-Free Parallel Two-Level-Deflation Preconditioner for the Two-Dimensional Helmholtz Problems <span id='bitlink-845'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(845)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-845' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(845)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Matrix-Free Parallel Two-Level-Deflation Preconditioner for the Two-Dimensional Helmholtz Problems</b><br />Jinqiang Chen<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-201.html'>Modern Solvers for the Helmholtz and Wave Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>We propose a matrix-free parallel two-level-deflation preconditioner combined with the Complex Shifted Laplacian preconditioner(CSLP) for the two-dimensional Helmholtz problems. The Helmholtz problem, widely studied in seismic exploration, is hard to solve both in terms of accuracy and convergence, due to the scalability issues of the numerical solvers. For large-scale applications, high-performance parallel scalable methods are also indispensable. In our method, we use the preconditioned Krylov subspace methods to solve the linear system obtained from finite-difference discretization. The CSLP preconditioner is approximately inverted by one parallel geometric multigrid V-cycle. Motivated by the observation that the eigenvalues of the CSLP-preconditioned system shift towards zero for large wavenumbers, deflation with multigrid vectors and further high-order vectors were incorporated to obtain wave-number-independent convergence. We also compare Galerkin coarsening method and high-order re-discretization on the coarse grid. The matrix-vector products and the inter-grid operations are implemented based on the finite-difference grids without constructing the coefficient matrix. These adjustments lead to direct improvements in terms of memory consumption. Numerical experiments show that wavenumber independence has been obtained for medium wavenumbers. The matrix-free parallel framework shows satisfactory parallel performance and weak scalability.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75511' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk920' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(920)' class='star'><span class='star920'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (G111)</b> Alexander Ruettgers, Scalable Machine Learning to Analyze Rocket Combustion Data <span id='bitlink-846'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(846)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-846' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(846)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Scalable Machine Learning to Analyze Rocket Combustion Data</b><br />Alexander Ruettgers<br />Monday, February 27 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-201.html'>Modern Solvers for the Helmholtz and Wave Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>Scalable machine learning algorithms were used to analyze hybrid rocket combustion experiments.   Recently, combustion tests with different paraffin-based fuels have been performed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the whole process has been recorded with a high-speed video camera. This has led to a larger number of images that needs to be automatically analyzed [Ruettgers et al., Clustering of paraffin-based hybrid rocket fuels combustion data. Exp. Fluids, 61:4 (2020)]. Since data analysis of millions of images is very demanding with respect to computing time and memory requirement, HeAT, the Helmholtz Analytics Toolkit,  is used on a parallel cluster at DLR to reduce the computing time. HeAT is an open source Python library (https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat)   for parallel machine learning. It is jointly developed by Juelich Research Center, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and DLR [Goetz et al., HeAT-a Distributed and GPU-accelerated Tensor Framework for Data Analytics. 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (2020), pp. 276--287].     
In this talk, machine learning algorithms are used to identify different flow phases and to detect anomalies [Ruettgers and Petrarolo, Local Anomaly Detection in Hybrid Rocket Combustion Tests. Exp. Fluids, 62:136 (2021)]. Furthermore, we present results on the parallel scaling behaviour of Heat compared to other existing parallel machine learning libraries.

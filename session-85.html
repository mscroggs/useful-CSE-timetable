This model is framed within a Quadruple Helix (QH) structure, with four main distinct clusters (government, industry, academia and community user). This academic-business model is then implemented via a proposed mathematical/industrial mathematics modelling activity, which is essentially rested on the knowledge transfer mechanism and entrepreneurial process. This underlying activity apparently would fulfil our sequence of steps in the modelling of a real-world problem within QH framework. This programme is then applied to a real-world industrial problem. This problem would link up to the QH clusters and is described by a presumed workable industrial problem, incorporating PDE analysis and Green function method on Surface Water (SW), Riverbank Filtration (RBF) and Groundwater (GW) modelling. The main goal is to generate an integrated water management scheme which would ensure an optimal conjunctive use of SW, RBF and GW sources of treated clean water, thus preventing unscheduled disruption of clean water supply to Water Authority account holders. The final outcome is to achieve and sustain a reasonably practicable and optimal conjunctive/integrated water management system for a community of Water Authority users.

There are several factors that can cause disruption. And road accidents are one of the major causes. This research was requested by the Thai General Insurance Association for this problem. This research creates a system for assessing the damage effects of a car as if it were an expert in the investigation. The model predicts the severity and damaged parts of the vehicle, reducing the amount of time and procedure for determining damage in the event of an accident by surveyors. The technology was used to analyze vehicle damage images together with the principles of machine learning in analysis. This is coupled with the use of correlation principles and text analysis to determine the causality of the chronology to be used for analysis based on the information recorded from both parties. Coupled with the system's ability to identify the location and environment of the accident scene, it is used through a central system that stores images and text. The diagnosis uses principles consistent with the database to store patterns of accidents in various ways in accordance with the Disaster Survey Manual under the Land Traffic Act for monitoring the damage. The system can initially determine whether a party is right or wrong, and it can also reduce the process of assessing damages for claims, and reporting an accident for convenience and speed, as well as reducing obstructing traffic on the road.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75347' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk385' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(385)' class='star'><span class='star385'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (D408)</b> Kenji Kajiwara, Generation of Aesthetic Curves and Surfaces by Integrable Geometry <span id='bitlink-355'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(355)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-355' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(355)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Generation of Aesthetic Curves and Surfaces by Integrable Geometry</b><br />Kenji Kajiwara<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-85.html'>Mathematics for Industry in the Asia Pacific Area - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>We first consider the log-aesthetic curves (LAC), which is a family of planar curves developed and used in the area of industrial design as shape elements with built-in aesthetic nature. The LAC has been originally proposed by extracting the common properties from thousands of plane curves that car designers regard as aesthetic, which includes various spirals as special cases, such as the circle involute, the clothoid, the Nielsen's spiral, and the logarithmic spiral.    
We present a new mathematical framework of the LAC on the theory of integrable systems and the similarity geometry, a Klein geometry associated with the similarity transformation group. Using this framework, we show that the similarity curvature is governed by the stationary Burgers equation and that the LAC is characterized by the variational principle. Namely, the LAC can be regarded as the similarity geometry analogue of the celebrated Euler’s elasticae in the Euclidean geometry.  Based on this result, we present some generalizations of LAC: (i) integrable discretization, (ii) space curves, and (iii) surfaces. We expect that those curves and surfaces may be useful for generating “aesthetic shapes”.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75347' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk386' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(386)' class='star'><span class='star386'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM (D408)</b> Ming-Hsiao Lee, Effective Modelling for PCBA Warpage Simulation <span id='bitlink-356'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(356)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-356' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(356)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Effective Modelling for PCBA Warpage Simulation</b><br />Ming-Hsiao Lee<br />Thursday, March 2 3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-85.html'>Mathematics for Industry in the Asia Pacific Area - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>A printed circuit board (PCB) is a multi-layered composite which includes many layers of copper circuits and dielectric materials. It is used as a backbone to carry and connect various electronic components, i.e. PCBA, to achieve certain functions. However, because the components are decreasing in size, the reliability of PCBA have become a critical issue. One of the serious problems is the warpage, which is induced by the thermal mismatch between unevenly-distributed circuits, dielectric layers and assembled components during the manufacturing process which experiences a temperature variation. This may cause defects in the assemblies. It is helpful to simulate in advance to evaluate. However, since the circuit on a PCB is very tiny compared with the size of the PCB or the components, it is too difficult to build a finite element model to include all the details of circuits and components. Hence, a feasible way is needed. Here, a new effective modelling approach which adopts equivalent material properties is proposed for PCBA warpage simulation. In this approach, the multi-layered PCB with connected components (PCBA) are meshed and connected properly, and the model is not too large while the circuit’s effect is still considered. With the proposed approaches, this method can be useful and efficient to simulate the PCBA manufacturing process to evaluate the warpage of the PCBA. Even those cases with irregular-shaped PCBs and shielding frames can be also treated efficiently.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75347' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

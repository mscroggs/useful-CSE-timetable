To maximize throughput, it is desirable to establish direct connections between those pairs that currently have a high communication demand and to reconfigure the links whenever the demand changes. We show how the problem of determining an optimal configuration can be cast as a subgraph coloring problem and study its complexity and various algorithmic solutions both in theory and practice.

Each carbon atom can make four covalent bonds.  Therefore, the number of neighbor carbon atoms to a particular carbon atom  is four minus the number of its hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, the number of  second neighbor carbon atoms is three times the number of neighbor carbon  atoms minus the number of those hydrogen atoms that the neighbor carbon  atoms bond. That is, from the 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we can obtain the degree  and neighbor degree sequences of hydrocarbons. When these hydrocarbons are  saturated and acyclic (these properties are easy to check by simple, fast  and cheap lab tests), the chemical structure prediction is equivalent to  constructing bounded degree trees with prescribed degree and neighbor  degree sequences.    
We will present a polynomial running time algorithm to the construction  problem and we will also provide a polynomial delay enumeration algorithm  to enumerate all possible solutions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75716' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1454' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1454)' class='star'><span class='star1454'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (D503)</b> Sandor Szabo, A Clique Based Algorithm for Scheduling Coupled Tasks with Delay <span id='bitlink-1338'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1338)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1338' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1338)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Clique Based Algorithm for Scheduling Coupled Tasks with Delay</b><br />Sandor Szabo<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-320.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>The clique search algorithms has improved to such an extent that   today we may compute clique numbers of highly non-trial size graphs.   These algorithm are even more efficient in the particular case when   one wants to locate $k$-cliques in $k$-partite graphs.   In this work we single out a scheduling problem in which tasks are   coupled and the time delay between the first and second member of   the couple is fixed by technological constraints.    
We will show that this scheduling problem can be reduced to the   question to decide if a tactically constructed $k$-partite auxiliary   graph contains a $k$-clique.   The scheduling problems can be reformulated as an integer linear program   and can be handled using powerful solvers.   We argue that if the clique version of the scheduling problem is not   overly large and the existing clique solvers can handle it, then the   clique approach has certain advantages.   These are the following.  The clique solver does not use floating point arithmetic and so it is   rounding error free.   The clique reformulation technique is flexible enough to incorporate   extra conflicts between tasks in case they would arise in practice.     
We will point out that before submitting the auxiliary graph to a   clique solver it is useful to carry out various inspections in order   to delete nodes and edges of the graph.   In the lack of theoretical tools we will carry out numerical experiments   to test the practicality of the clique approach.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75716' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1455' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1455)' class='star'><span class='star1455'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (D503)</b> Andras Bota, Network-Based Framework for Estimating the Risk Factors of Epidemic Spreading <span id='bitlink-1339'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1339)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1339' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1339)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Network-Based Framework for Estimating the Risk Factors of Epidemic Spreading</b><br />Andras Bota<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-320.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>Network-based adaptations of traditional compartmental infection models such as SIR or SEIR can be used to model the spreading of diseases between cities, countries or other geographical regions. One of the common challenges arising in these applications is the lack of available transmission probabilities between these geographical units. Several methods have been proposed recently for solving this task. One of them is the Generalized Inverse Infection Model (GIIM) [A. Bóta, L. M. Gardner: A generalized framework for the estimation of edge infection probabilities. arXiv:1706.07532]. GIIM offers a large amount of modelling flexibility and allows transmission probabilities to be defined as a function of known attributes, or risk factors in an epidemic context. In this presentation we will see how GIIM works in two specific real-life outbreaks. The first one considers the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in the Americas [L. M. Gardner, A. Bóta, N. D. Grubaugh, K. Gangavarapu, M. U. G. Kramer: Inferring the risk factors behind the geographical spread and transmission of Zika in the Americas. PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases 12 (1), e0006194 (2018)], while he second application models the 2009 H1N1 outbreak between the municipalities of Sweden [A. Bóta, M. Holmberg, L. M. Gardner, M. Rosvall: Socio-economic and environmental patterns behind H1N1 spreading in Sweden. Scientific Reports 11 (1), 1-14, 2021.]

Disinformation campaigns with the presence of a committed minority are of particular concern because a minority with as low as 10% of the population can overtake the majority’s opinion. This phenomenon is characterized by a strong tipping point (phase transition) separating two distinct outcomes. Previous studies employed the binary agreement model on Erd&#337;s-R&eacute;nyi random, scale-free, and complete networks. Here, we examine the binary agreement model on hundreds of random graphs of several types (e.g., barbell, small world, etc.) to connect the tipping point to graph metrics (e.g., assortativity, betweenness, etc.). We also explore the dynamics on Facebook networks. The binary agreement model is run to steady state on all networks utilizing hundreds of core hours. Using the data generated in these simulations, we calculate correlation functions of individual’s opinions and calculate scaling exponents of the phase transitions. Gaining insights into the nature of the tipping points suggests strategies for mitigating the spread of disinformation.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75716' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

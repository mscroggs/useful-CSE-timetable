<h2>Perspectives on Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk615' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(615)' class='star'><span class='star615'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (E107)</b> Feliks N&#252;ske, Model Reduction Based on the Koopman Generator <span id='bitlink-573'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(573)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-573' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(573)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Model Reduction Based on the Koopman Generator</b><br />Feliks N&#252;ske<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-135.html'>Perspectives on Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>The determination of low-dimensional collective variables (CVs) is a critical problem in various application areas, including molecular dynamics. However, finding good CVs, for example in the sense of retaining slow dynamical time scales of the full system, is a highly non-trivial problem.    
In this talk, I will present recent progress on the determination of CVs using the projection formalism for stochastic dynamics developed by [Legoll and Lelièvre, Nonlinearity (2010)] and [Zhang et al, Faraday Discuss. (2016)]. This formalism amounts to projecting the Koopman generator of the full system onto the space of functions which only depend on the CV space. The first result I will show is an error estimate comparing the slow time scales of the projected and the full system. We arrive at a Galerkin-type estimate, bounding the error in terms of the projection error for dominant eigenfunctions [Nüske et al, Entropy (2021)].    
Then, I will move on to show how a data-driven approximation of the projected generator can be obtained by a technique called generator extended dynamic mode decomposition (gEDMD) [Klus, Nüske, et al, Physica D (2020)]. This method can also be formulated if a tensor product basis is used as Galerkin subspace [Lücke and Nüske, J. Nonlinear Sci. (2022)], enabling the use of powerful approximation spaces. Finally, I will discuss bounds for the estimation error of the gEDMD method in terms of the amount of simulation data [Nüske et al, arXiv:2108.07102 (2021)].    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75423' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk616' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(616)' class='star'><span class='star616'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (E107)</b> Felix Dietrich, Approximation of Response Surfaces from Partial Information <span id='bitlink-574'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(574)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-574' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(574)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Approximation of Response Surfaces from Partial Information</b><br />Felix Dietrich<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-135.html'>Perspectives on Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>We discuss how to use dimension reduction methods to organize unstructured ensembles of partial observations of a system’s response surface. We assume to have no knowledge about where on the surface the observations are obtained. We do, however, record measurements not only at the point of observation, but also in its immediate vicinity. We demonstrate how such partial and disorganized observation ensembles can be integrated into coherent response surfaces whose dimension and parametrization can be systematically recovered in a data-driven fashion. The approach can be justified through the Whitney and Takens embedding theorems. We demonstrate our approach by organizing unstructured observations of a cusp bifurcation surface for Hydrogen combustion in a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor. Finally, we discuss more generally which adjustments to common measurement procedures are necessary to obtain useful reconstructions.

The search space of its solutions grows exponentially with $N$, limiting exact methods to only the smallest molecules. Approximate quantum chemistry methods can be considered as reduced-order models that scale only polynomially with $N$ and seek to strike a balance between accuracy and computational cost. Paulinet is one such model based on a physics-inspired deep-learning ansatz for the wave function that is optimized in a data-driven fashion within the framework of variational quantum Monte Carlo. It integrates three ingredients: exact physics as constraints, approximate physics as baselines, and neural networks as universal approximators. Paulinet competes in accuracy with state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods while offering better scaling with system size.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75423' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk618' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(618)' class='star'><span class='star618'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (E107)</b> Mourad Oulghelou, Data-Driven Prediction of Parametric Flows <span id='bitlink-576'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(576)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-576' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(576)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data-Driven Prediction of Parametric Flows</b><br />Mourad Oulghelou<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-135.html'>Perspectives on Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>Model reduction techniques enable to transform large-scale dynamical systems into systems of much smaller dimension. In general, such reduced systems are achieved by projecting the high fidelity equations onto a reduced subspace obtained by the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. With varying parameters, such projected models may experience instabilities even if the original system is asymptotically stable. Moreover, the data may originate from experience making hard the application of Galerkin projection. To overcome these issues, we propose a data-driven approach to construct parametric reduced order models (DD/PROM). Regardless of the origin of the data, the DD/PROM is achieved by learning the model through residual assimilation. Then, interpolation on the  tangent space of the Grassmann manifold is used to handle parameter variations. We show on the example of the flow past a cylinder, that the PROM/DD succeeds to reproduce the dynamics with a good accuracy, for a wide range of Reynolds number values.

With the ease of accessibility of data, learning models directly from the data have recently drawn much attention. Constructing simple and compact models describing complex nonlinear dynamics is also desirable for efficient engineering studies on modest computer hardware. To achieve our goal, we focus on the lifting principles--that is, sufficiently smooth nonlinear systems can be rewritten as quadratic models in an appropriate coordinate system. Therefore, we focus on identifying suitable coordinate systems such that a quadratic model can describe the dynamics in the obtained coordinate system. To determine such a coordinate system, we leverage the powerful expressive capabilities of deep learning, particularly autoencoders. Moreover, in several physical systems where energy preservation is preserved, we focus on identifying the coordinate systems that can also preserve energy. We illustrate the methodologies to learn the desired coordinate systems for nonlinear dynamical models by illustrative examples.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75423' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

<h2>Scientific Machine Learning and Data-Driven Techniques in Complex Multi-Physics Systems  - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk666' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(666)' class='star'><span class='star666'>&star;</span></a> <b>1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM (E108)</b> Stefano Pagani, Scientific Machine Learning Models in Cardiac Electrophysiology <span id='bitlink-619'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(619)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-619' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(619)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Scientific Machine Learning Models in Cardiac Electrophysiology</b><br />Stefano Pagani<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-147.html'>Scientific Machine Learning and Data-Driven Techniques in Complex Multi-Physics Systems  - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Cutting-edge machine- and deep-learning technologies for processing and analyzing clinical data enable new approaches to personalized diagnosis and treatment based on individual patient characteristics. These approaches require large volumes of high-resolution data for training the models, which are not always available: measurements may be incomplete, affected by noise, or give a partial reconstruction of the phenomenon.     
In this talk, we present physics-aware and physics-informed learning approaches that leverage clinical data with the physical knowledge of underlying phenomena. Specifically, we adopt dimensionality reduction techniques built from simulation snapshots in physics-aware artificial neural networks to improve prediction accuracy and training efficiency. We also consider additional physics-informed constraints to data-driven loss functions. These terms directly penalize the residual of partial differential equations or boundary/initial conditions. In this way, we simultaneously counterbalance incomplete data with physical knowledge and improve the performance of low-complexity architectures based on a limited number of hyperparameters.    
We finally show some numerical results of physics-aware and physics-informed neural networks with applications to cardiac electrophysiology.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75442' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk667' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(667)' class='star'><span class='star667'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (E108)</b> Fernando Henriquez, Deep Neural Network Approximation in Shape Uncertainty Quantification for Acoustic and Electromagnetic Scattering <span id='bitlink-620'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(620)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-620' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(620)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Neural Network Approximation in Shape Uncertainty Quantification for Acoustic and Electromagnetic Scattering</b><br />Fernando Henriquez<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-147.html'>Scientific Machine Learning and Data-Driven Techniques in Complex Multi-Physics Systems  - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>We consider the acoustic and electromagnetic scattering problems by random domains and surfaces. Our goal is to construct an efficient approximation of the corresponding domain-to-solution map. After considering a domain or surface parametrization depending on countably many parameters, one obtains a high-dimensional parametric map describing the problem's solution manifold. To tackle the efficient approximation of these maps, we adopt the approach proposed by Hesthaven and Ubbiali (Journal of Computational Physics 363 (2018): 55-78.). Firstly, by using a collection of so-called high-fidelity solutions or snapshots, a reduced basis is constructed to approximate the solution manifold. Then, we use deep feed-forward neural networks to compute the coefficient of the reduced basis solution. This procedure renders the evaluation of the approximate parameter-to-solution in the online phase independent of the offline part.   Provided that the parameter-to-solution map satisfies certain smoothness properties, which have been verified for a range of models used in acoustic and electromagnetic scattering,   we show that one can use quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature rules in the computation of the snapshots used in the reduced basis and also in the training of the involved deep neural networks. Finally, we provide numerical results for different models arising in acoustic and electromagnetic scattering.

Despite their performance during model evaluation, SCL approaches suffer from a computationally exhaustive training phase.     
In this talk, we will leverage ideas from multilevel minimization methods to efficiently train deep neural networks (DNNs) employed in SCL applications. The main idea behind multilevel methods is to employ a hierarchy of auxiliary problems, which are minimized internally to accelerate the solution process of the original problem. We will discuss how to construct a multilevel hierarchy and transfer operators by exploring the properties of the loss function and the structure of the DNN architecture.     
The convergence properties of our novel training method will be analyzed using a series of numerical experiments, including physics-informed neural networks, and deep operator learning approaches. A comparison with the stochastic gradient and Adam optimizers will be also presented, showing a significant reduction in terms of the computational cost for the training phase.

Classical simulation methods often reach their limits. Even if the finite  element method is highly efficient and established for the discretization of the  Navier-Stokes equations, fundamental problems, such as the resolution of fine  structures or a correct information transport between scales, are still not  sufficiently solved.    
We discuss approaches to connect the finite element method with neural networks  to overcome these obstacles. The paradigm is to use classical simulation  techniques where their strengths are eminent, such as in the efficient  representation of a coarse, large-scale flow field. Neural networks are used  where a full resolution of the effects does not seem possible or efficient. The  Deep Neural Network Multigrid Solver takes up these ideas by combining a  geometric multigrid solver and a deep neural network. We show the efficiency,  generalizability and scalability by 2D and 3D simulations. We introduce an approach to retrain the network adaptively based on the uncertainty of the predictions.     
Based on extensions of the Deep Neural Network Multigrid Solver we offer  perspectives on how finite element simulations can benefit from neural networks in the future. In addition to the desired  increase in efficiency, the focus is particularly on issues of stability,  generalizability and error accuracy.

The physical asset in our setup is a meter-scale rig, allowing for applying mathematical imaging as measuring technology. The digital twin consists of a traditional physics-based forward simulation tool and a data-driven correction technique which augments the simulations and compensates for mismatches between simulation results and observations. We present the setup of the physical and digital twin, including data transfer protocols using cloud technology. The accuracy of the digital twin is demonstrated on a case with artificially high diffusion that must be compensated by the correction approach, as well as by simulations in geologically complex media. The digital twin is then applied to control tracer transport by manipulating fluid injection and production in the experimental rig, thereby enabling two-way coupling between the physical and digital twins.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75442' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

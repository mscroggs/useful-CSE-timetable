They are challenging to design, in part because experimental evaluation of a peptide's quality in particular application requires time-consuming and expensive chemical synthesis and characterization, and because a peptide's quality is hard to predict. We discuss the application of Bayesian optimization to this challenge, focusing on three testbed problems: peptides that prevent ice recrystallization, with applications to preserving organs for transplantation; and two ways of using peptides as sensors, one focused on binding metals, and the other on supporting enzymes that attach fluorescent chemical subgroups. All involve real experiments and face common challenges: incorporating domain expertise from chemists, making accurate predictions sequences with appropriately quantified uncertainty, optimizing acquisition functions over discrete sets of molecules, and appropriately leveraging time-consuming computational chemistry simulations.

EIC is utilizing adaptive experimentation strategies during the design and R&D phases, in order to deal with a complex design problem characterized by compute intensive simulations, multiple sub-detectors --- each characterized by multiple design parameters --- and multiple design criteria or objectives.  In this context, we explored state of the art solutions to design the experiment in a more efficient way. This talk provides an overview of the recent progress made during the EIC detector proposal; it will also cover how this work could further progress in the near future.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75228' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk102' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(102)' class='star'><span class='star102'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (G102)</b> Raul Astudillo, Multi-Information Source Bayesian Optimization of Culture Media for Cellular Agriculture <span id='bitlink-97'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(97)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-97' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(97)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multi-Information Source Bayesian Optimization of Culture Media for Cellular Agriculture</b><br />Raul Astudillo<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-22.html'>Bayesian Optimization in the Real World -  - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Culture media used in industrial bioprocessing and the emerging field of cellular agriculture is difficult to optimize due to the lack of rigorous mathematical models of cell growth and culture conditions, as well as the complexity of the design space. Rapid growth assays are inaccurate yet convenient, while robust measures of cell number can be time-consuming to the point of limiting experimentation. In this talk, we describe the use of multi-information source Bayesian optimization to optimize a cell culture media with 14 components. Following this approach, we were able to design media with 181% more cells than a common commercial variant with a similar economic cost while doing so in 38% fewer experiments than an efficient design-of-experiments method. Furthermore, the optimal medium generalized well to long-term growth up to four passages of C2C12 cells, indicating the multi-information source assay improved measurement robustness relative to rapid growth assays alone.

These scenarios occur for instance for complex interaction-simulations  or hyper-parameter search for machine learning applications.      
While classic Bayesian Optimization is iteratively updating the surrogate model of the black-box function according to the acquisition function Expected Improvement,  PMBO delivers a black-box model by fitting a polynomial surrogate to the objective function that enables fast optimization of the surrogate. Though due to the “No Free Lunch Theorem” there is no universal best optimizer, by benchmarking PMBO  against other state-of-the-art algorithms for a set of artificial, analytical functions and a biological Tumor Response Model, its performance results to be superior up to dimension 6.      
Apart from its good performance,  the novelty of the PMBO relies on providing a search space parametrization on the fly. This additional information enables post-processing analysis which cannot be achieved by prior established methods.

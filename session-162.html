A step-by-step procedure for general nonlinear hyperbolic problems on skew-symmetric form is presented. That procedure is subsequently applied to the three most important equations in computational fluid dynamics: the shallow water equations and the incompressible and compressible Euler equations. Both strong and weak imposition of the nonlinear boundary conditions are discussed. Based on the continuous analysis, we show that the new nonlinear boundary procedure lead to energy and entropy stable discrete approximations if the scheme is formulated on summation-by-parts form in combination with a weak implementation of the boundary conditions.

Recent research has shown that specific combinations of space and time discretization even yield unconditional stability of the resulting scheme with grid-independent time step restrictions only based on the convection and diffusion constants.  For DG space discretizations using upwind numerical fluxes, previous analysis via energy estimates has shown that the choice of diffusion fluxes influences this stabilization mechanism. For instance, whereas LDG fluxes allow for grid-independent time step sizes when IMEX time stepping is applied, the classical BR1 fluxes do not.  In this talk, we focus on the spatial discretization by upwind SBP schemes which introduce an upwind mechanism similar to numerical fluxes within the DG method. Using energy equations, we investigate the stability of upwind-SBP-discretized convection-diffusion problems using IMEX time stepping. This analysis is quite general and only requires a compatibility of the first and second derivative SBP operators. In particular, the upwind SBP framework allows to show that replacing upwind advection fluxes by central fluxes in fact suffices to guarantee grid-independent time step restrictions in case of BR1 diffusion fluxes.

Employing such a methodology within the context of a skew-symmetric discontinuous Galerkin formulation, we develop discretizations on curvilinear meshes which are energy conservative for the linear advection equation in the case of a central numerical flux and energy dissipative for an upwind numerical flux. We then describe the implementation of efficient algorithms for evaluating the proposed tensor-product operators within an open-source Julia code. Finally, the stability and conservation properties of the proposed methods are verified numerically, and comparisons with existing methods on the basis of accuracy and computational cost are presented, demonstrating that for higher polynomial degrees, the proposed schemes are more efficient than comparable multidimensional (i.e. non-tensor-product) formulations on triangles and tetrahedra.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75458' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk743' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(743)' class='star'><span class='star743'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G104)</b> Jason E.

SBP operators are typically defined on a geometrically simple reference domain — for example, a quadrilateral or triangular domain — and then mapped to elements in an unstructured mesh or blocks in a multi-block grid.  Here we consider a more flexible construction of SBP operators that is suitable for degrees of freedom over point clouds.  The construction is a generalization of the discontinuous Galerkin difference (DGD) method.  Unlike DGD, the proposed method does not pair degrees of freedom with elements in a one-to-one manner; instead, the element mesh is used only to perform integration and define the support of the basis functions.  We will present results that verify the method and demonstrate its flexibility; in particular, we will present how $r$-adaption can be applied to the method without modifying the mesh.

In comparison to polynomial approximations, rational functions can converge at exponential rates (root-exponential to be precise) even for functions with singularities. In this talk we focus on branch point singularities, which may arise in applications as singularities at corners or edges of a computational domain. We show that poles in a typical rational approximation for such functions cluster towards the singularity, not unlike graded meshes do in adaptive numerical simulation methods. The class of so-called “lightning methods” for boundary value problems, developed by Trefethen and collaborators, explicitly uses rational approximations and exploits this property by choosing clustered poles in advance. This turns the rational approximation problem into a linear one, since rational functions depend non-linearly on the location of the poles but linearly on the associated residues. We show that a judicious choice of the distribution of poles has a significant impact on the rate of convergence. Moreover, the chosen representation of the rational functions, i.e., the basis of the approximation space, strongly affects the numerical stability of these classes of methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75458' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

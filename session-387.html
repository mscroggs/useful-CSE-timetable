We will also outline a few of our own contributions in the area of high-order accurate kernel-independent methods for evaluation of the Newtonian potential based on numerical quadrature. The methods are based on corrections to (FMM-accelerated) quadratures for smooth functions, with rapidly-generated pre-computed corrections that can be efficiently applied using orthogonal polynomials, achieving $ > 99$% of fast algorithm performance. We will also demonstrate adaptive solvers using quadtree and box-code based fast algorithms.

In this work, we address the evaluation of the $H^{-r}(D)$ norm of a function $c\in L^2(D)$, with $r\in]1/2,1]$. To this end, the Riesz representative $u[c]\in H^r_0(D)$ of $c$ is sought, and we then have $\Vert c\Vert _{H^{-r}(D)}=(u[c],c)_{L^2(D)}$. Computing $u[c]$ by domain discretization methods (e.g. FEM) for fractional $r$ would entail either the costly accurate evaluation of sufficiently many Dirichlet Laplace eigenfunctions of $D$ or multiple elliptic problem solves. By contrast, the computational treatment proposed here rests on one volume integral operator (VIO) evaluation with density $c$ followed by solving one single-layer integral equation (SLIE) on $\partial D$ (ensuring $\gamma u[c]=0$). The kernel used in both the VIO and the SLIE depends in closed form on $r$ and the physical coordinates (and has a singularity of order $2r-d$); in fact, the VIO is directly connected with the $H^{-r}(R^d)$ Fourier-Bessel norm. We prove that the SLIE in weak form is coercive on $H^{1/2-r}(\partial D)$ for any $r\in]1/2,1]$, making it well-posed. Our procedure thus naturally extends to fractional $r$ the method solving in $H^1_0(D)$ the Poisson problem with given density $c$. We demonstrate the proposed approach on computational examples with available reference solutions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75859' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1761' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1761)' class='star'><span class='star1761'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM (D301)</b> Carlos Perez-Arancibia, Density Interpolation Methods for Volume Potentials <span id='bitlink-1610'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1610)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1610' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1610)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Density Interpolation Methods for Volume Potentials</b><br />Carlos Perez-Arancibia<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-387.html'>Recent Advances on Integral Equation and Spectral Methods for Inhomogeneous Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>We present a simple numerical method for the high-order numerical evaluation of volume integral operators associated with the Poisson and Helmholtz equations in two spatial dimensions. Following the ideas of the density interpolation method for boundary integral operators, the proposed methodology leverages Green's third identity and a local polynomial interpolation of the source function to recast the volume potential as a sum of single- and double-layer potentials and a volume integral with a regularized (bounded or smoother) integrand. The layer potentials can be accurately and efficiently evaluated everywhere by means of existing methods (e.g. the density interpolation method), while the regularized volume integral can be accurately evaluated by applying elementary quadrature rules.  Numerical examples based on non-overlapping quadrilateral patch representations of the domain in conjunction with Chebyshev-grid discretizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75859' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1762' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1762)' class='star'><span class='star1762'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM (D301)</b> Ignacio Labarca, Volume Integral Equations and Single-Trace Formulations for Acoustic Wave Scattering in an Inhomogeneous Medium <span id='bitlink-1611'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1611)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1611' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1611)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Volume Integral Equations and Single-Trace Formulations for Acoustic Wave Scattering in an Inhomogeneous Medium</b><br />Ignacio Labarca<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-387.html'>Recent Advances on Integral Equation and Spectral Methods for Inhomogeneous Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>We study frequency domain acoustic scattering at a bounded, penetrable, and inhomogeneous obstacle. By defining constant reference coefficients, a representation formula for the pressure field in derived. It contains a volume integral operator, related to the one in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Besides, it features integral operators defined on the boundary of the obstacle and closely related to boundary integral equations of single-trace formulation (STF) for transmission problems with piecewise constant coefficients. We show well-posedness of the continuous variational formulation and asymptotic convergence of Galerkin discretizations. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D validate our expected convergence rates.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75859' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1763' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1763)' class='star'><span class='star1763'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM (D301)</b> Andr&#233;s Prieto, A Phase Retrieval Approach to Characterize Underwater Transducers Using Time-Harmonic Near-Field Data <span id='bitlink-1612'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1612)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1612' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1612)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Phase Retrieval Approach to Characterize Underwater Transducers Using Time-Harmonic Near-Field Data</b><br />Andr&#233;s Prieto<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-387.html'>Recent Advances on Integral Equation and Spectral Methods for Inhomogeneous Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Active acoustic devices have been used profusely in monitoring activities in coastal and oceanic marine environments for fishery purposes and the health evaluation of the seabed and its related biological ecosystems. The accurate numerical characterization of those active transducers, which insonifies the underwater fluid media, plays a crucial role in the subsequent numerical simulations of complex marine environments. The transducers can be quickly characterized experimentally using in-house laboratory equipment where their acoustic response can be obtained from time-harmonic near-field phaseless data. Obviously, the extrapolation of those near-field data to predict the time-harmonic far-field generated pressure cannot be computed straightforwardly and requires estimating the directivity pattern associated with the transducer. Different numerical approaches based on an integral representation of the pressure field are analyzed in this work. Since the phaseless experimental near-field data is known in a reduced number of locations, different polynomial discretizations have been utilized to discretize the directivity pattern taking into account low-order spherical harmonics and standard finite element polynomial approximations. Both approaches are compared in realistic scenarios with available closed-form solutions such as omnidirectional sources and end-fire arrays. The impact of using different phase retrieval and quadrature methods is also quantified.

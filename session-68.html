Its transport through the plant has been studied for more than a century, but the detailed mechanisms of transport, in particular the long-range transport from top to roots, are still not fully clear.     
In this talk we discuss how mathematical modeling, simulation and experimental research have been integrated to gain insights into these mechanisms in the model plant  Arabidopsis thaliana. The model consists of a coupled system of reaction-diffusion-advection equations. Parameter estimation procedures and physiologically relevant ranges for parameters require simulation of the model in regimes where the Peclet number is neither large nor small, causing numerical complications.     
Moreover, experimental circumstances strongly limit the number of data points (of various types) that can be obtained. A practical parameter identifiability analysis needs to be performed to identify which parameter combinations can still be confidently estimated from the data. We introduce such a method and show that the addition of the measurement of a single well-chosen quantity (and single data point) in the experimental design can drastically influence the collection of identifiable parameter sets. Any of these sets can then be used to draw conclusions on the underlying mechanisms and aid in the 'reverse-engineering' of the long-range auxin transport mechanism.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75313' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk309' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(309)' class='star'><span class='star309'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM (D507)</b> Cordula Reisch, Model Selection Using Rare Data in Life-Sciences <span id='bitlink-285'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(285)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-285' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(285)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Model Selection Using Rare Data in Life-Sciences</b><br />Cordula Reisch<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-68.html'>Data-Driven Methods in Computational Biomechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Biological processes are the result of many interacting particles on microscopic scales. While some of the particles and interactions are well known, oftentimes not all dynamics are fully understood. Therefore, pure physics-based modeling approaches are not always successful.     
Apart from that, some outcomes of the considered biological processes are usually observable on a macroscopic scale. Although, the observations mostly do not include time and space resolved measurements of all interacting components but some information at discrete times. These observations serve as quantitative data for the biological applications. The quantitative data is usually not sufficient for pure data-driven approaches.     
In this talk, ideas on how to use the rare data in a model selection process are presented: Mesoscopic models connect the different scales by abstracting from the microscopic particles and interactions. The few microscopic information on mechanisms and the observation on the macroscopic scale enable together physics-informed machine learning techniques for the mesoscopic model.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75313' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk310' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(310)' class='star'><span class='star310'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM (D507)</b> Qiyao Peng, Applying Machine Learning to Enhance the Computational Efficiency in Agent-Based Wound Healing Model <span id='bitlink-286'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(286)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-286' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(286)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Applying Machine Learning to Enhance the Computational Efficiency in Agent-Based Wound Healing Model</b><br />Qiyao Peng<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-68.html'>Data-Driven Methods in Computational Biomechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Deep tissue injuries often go with a contraction of the skin. This contraction can become contracture if it causes a loss of mobility of the joint of the patient. Contracture results from the cellular traction forces exerted by the (myo)fibroblasts during the proliferation phase. In Peng and Vermolen (2020), an agent-based model is developed to mimic the wound healing, in which every cell is treated individually as a fixed circle in two dimensions. To model the cellular forces exerted by the (myo)fibroblasts, the cell membrane is first broken into line segments. Then, the point forces are applied at the midpoint of each line segment using the Dirac Delta distribution and then solving the elasticity equation with finite-element methods; this is the most computationally expensive part of the entire model. Since our final goal is to predict the likelihood that such a contracture occurs and to analyze the impact of several treatments on preventing a serious contraction, the model has to be evaluated many times and a computationally efficient model is required. Moreover, while myofibroblasts are known as a dendritic shape with lamellipodium developed from the cell membrane, a large number of line segments would be needed to model such cell membrane shapes. In the talk, the benefits of the machine learning-enhanced model with respect to the variation of the cell shape and the resulting improvements in the computational efficiency are discussed based on numerical results.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75313' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk311' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(311)' class='star'><span class='star311'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM (D507)</b> Stefan Frei, Efficient Coarse Propagators for Parallel Time Stepping in Plaque Growth Simulations <span id='bitlink-287'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(287)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-287' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(287)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Coarse Propagators for Parallel Time Stepping in Plaque Growth Simulations</b><br />Stefan Frei<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-68.html'>Data-Driven Methods in Computational Biomechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>The numerical simulation of atherosclerotic plaque growth is computationally prohibitive, since it involves a complex cardiovascular fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem with a characteristic time scale of milliseconds to seconds, as well as a plaque growth process governed by reaction-diffusion equations, which takes place over several months.  A resolution of the fast (micro) scale over this period can easily require more than a billion time steps, each corresponding to the solution of a computationally expensive FSI problem.     
To tackle this problem, we combine a temporal homogenisation approach with parallel time-stepping. First, a temporal homogenisation approach separates the problem in an FSI problem on the micro scale and a reaction-diffusion problem on the macro scale.  Second, a parallel time-stepping approach based on the parareal algorithm is applied on the macro-scale of the homogenised system. The parallel scalability is, however, dominated by the computational cost of the coarse propagator. We discuss different possibilities to modify the coarse propagator to further reduce the number of expensive micro problems to be solved and test the numerical algorithms in detailed numerical studies.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75313' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk312' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(312)' class='star'><span class='star312'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM (D507)</b> Mercy G.

A very simple task performed by an individual such as raising an arm or lifting a leg can be accomplished with a wide range of muscle activation levels due to the concept of muscle redundancy. Some quantification is provided for the redundancy while presenting feasible solutions (muscle forces at joints). A sample of feasible solutions is generated for each time instance in the time interval for executing a specific locomotion of the body. This is done in the Bayesian framework, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. These solutions are in conformance with the uncontrolled manifold theory. Furthermore, inspired by the principles surrounding the Feynman-Kac formula, we propose an approach that smoothly connects the muscle activation pattern at each time instance to mimic the smoothness exhibited in normal human movement.

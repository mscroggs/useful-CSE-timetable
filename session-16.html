<h2>Low-Rank Approximation for Dynamical Systems - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk71' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(71)' class='star'><span class='star71'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (D504)</b> Alec Dektor, Tensor Rank Reduction via Coordinate Flows <span id='bitlink-68'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(68)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-68' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(68)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tensor Rank Reduction via Coordinate Flows</b><br />Alec Dektor<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-16.html'>Low-Rank Approximation for Dynamical Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>We present a new tensor rank reduction method that leverages coordinate flows and can greatly increase the efficiency of high-dimensional tensor approximation algorithms. The idea is very simple: given a multivariate function, determine a coordinate transformation so that the function in the new coordinate system has smaller tensor rank. We restrict our analysis to linear coordinate transformations, which give rise to a new class of functions that we refer to as tensor ridge functions. By leveraging coordinate flows and tensor ridge functions, we develop an optimization method based on Riemannian gradient descent that yields a quasi-optimal linear coordinate transformation for tensor rank reduction. The theoretical results we present for rank reduction via linear coordinate transformations can be generalized to larger classes of nonlinear transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new tensor rank reduction method on prototype function approximation problems, and in computing the numerical solution of the Liouville equation in dimension three and five    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75211' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk72' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(72)' class='star'><span class='star72'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D504)</b> Ryan McClarren, Low-Rank Approximations for Dynamic Particle Transport Problems <span id='bitlink-69'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(69)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-69' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(69)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Low-Rank Approximations for Dynamic Particle Transport Problems</b><br />Ryan McClarren<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-16.html'>Low-Rank Approximation for Dynamical Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Dynamical low rank methods applied to particle transport problems have several open questions that I will address in this talk. Firstly, there is the question of whether or not typical problems actually have low rank structure and how this varies as a system evolves. We will answer this with examples from common test problems. One interesting result is that if the particle transport problem is decomposed into different octants based on the direction of particle travel there are different ranks in each octant. We show how this can be exploited to have more efficient calculations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the adaptive low rank method recently developed can be used to find approximately the correct rank during a calculation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75211' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk73' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(73)' class='star'><span class='star73'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D504)</b> Jack Coughlin, Towards Efficient Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation of Collisional Kinetic Equations <span id='bitlink-70'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(70)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-70' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(70)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards Efficient Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation of Collisional Kinetic Equations</b><br />Jack Coughlin<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-16.html'>Low-Rank Approximation for Dynamical Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Kinetic equations are of great importance to application areas such as plasma physics and rarefied gas dynamics. In regimes where collisions are very strong, efficient model reductions to hydrodynamic systems can be derived from asymptotic arguments such as the Chapman-Enskog expansion, reducing the dimensionality from 6 to 3. At the same time, dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) algorithms are particularly promising for kinetic equations because of their high dimensionality and the &#8220;tensor-friendly' nature of their terms. However, it is not obvious how to combine the hydrodynamic model reduction approach with dynamical low-rank approximation algorithms, because the zeroth-order solution---the Maxwellian---is not a low-rank function of its arguments. We present a DLRA strategy based on an alternative low-rank decomposition, focusing on a model plasma kinetic equation, which can capture the Maxwellian limit with a very small numerical rank. Our approach yields multiple orders of magnitude speedups on a 2D2V problem, while preserving the system's dynamics across a range of regimes.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75211' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk74' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(74)' class='star'><span class='star74'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D504)</b> William T.

The exponential growth in computational complexity often challenges a grid-based approach to modeling the Boltzmann equation as the dimensionality grows. To mitigate such issues, scalable low-rank tensor decomposition techniques have recently been developed with applications to high-dimensional PDEs. Despite the remarkable progress made in the community, low-rank structures in the phase-space are not evident in realistic engineering systems with complex geometries (e.g., electric propulsions systems and fusion reactors), where discontinuities, shocks, complex boundary conditions, and material-dependent physics (e.g., collisions, fusion reactions, ionization/excitation, charge-exchange processes) pose formidable challenges. In this talk, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm where quad-tree adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is applied in real space while a low-rank approximation is applied in the velocity space. The AMR algorithm efficiently handles challenges pertaining to complex structures in real space, while the low-rank formulation targets dimensionality challenges in the velocity space. We present preliminary results on the new algorithm applied to challenging multi-dimensional gas kinetics problems.

In this contribution, we consider two ways of generating these projection functions data-based and physics-based approaches. In a data-based method called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to training data to obtain the projection function. In contrast, in the physics-based approach, named Linear manifold(LM), the dynamic eigenmodes of the system are extended using modal derivatives that can capture the effect of nonlinear kinematics. In this contribution, we intend to model quasi-statics of the same high-fidelity problem to observe the difference between these methods. To this extent, we propose a residual parameter in the reduced space for both these methods and an additional mode selection algorithm for the physics-based method(LM). As a start, we assess the performance of both these methods on problems involving geometric nonlinearity. The results showed that the displacement error for these methods for problems involving simple loading scenarios falls below 1 %, and an approx. time gain of 30 % with the original FE calculation. The difference in these methods has been visible in complex loading scenarios, where LM takes less number of modes in comparison to POD to reach an error below 1 %, but the time gain remained the same.

<h2>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk591' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(591)' class='star'><span class='star591'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (G106)</b> Gregor Gassner, Subcell Limiting Strategies for Split-Form DG Schemes <span id='bitlink-549'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(549)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-549' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(549)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Subcell Limiting Strategies for Split-Form DG Schemes</b><br />Gregor Gassner<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-130.html'>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we present ideas from the recently published paper [Rueda-Ram√≠rez, A. M., Pazner, W., Gassner, G.J. Subcell Limiting Strategies for Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Methods. Computers and Fluids (2022).  \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00576}.] and explain how to construct a compatible subcell finite volume scheme that can be seamlessly blended with a high order spectral element discontinuous Galerkin method. We focus on the discretization of (non-linear) conservation laws, such as the KPP equation and the compressible Euler equation.     
Starting with an entropy-dissipative split-form discontinuous Galerkin scheme on collocated Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes, we show how to carefully design a finite volume type discretization on the LGL subcell grid such that it is (i) still provably entropy-dissipative/stable/conservative and (ii) compatible to the high order DG scheme in the sense that we can blend between the low order finite volume and the high order DG discretization on a per element level, or a per node level.     
This new hybrid scheme enables us to do shock capturing and preserve positivity of the solution. We present several strategies including heuristic troubled cell indicators and positivity preserving mechanisms, as well as sophisticated positivity techniques from Flux Corrected Transport schemes including Invariant Domain Preservation a posteriori stabilization and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

The so-called stiff source term problem of LeVeque & Yee (1990) is one well-known example. This problem manifests itself as discontinuities that propagate with the wrong speed when the numerical solution is under resolved and/or too diffusive in both space and time. The construction of numerical methods for (a) stable and accurate simulation of turbulence with strong shocks, and for (b) obtaining the correct propagation speed of discontinuities in the presence of stiff reacting terms share one important ingredient - minimization of numerical  dissipation while maintaining numerical stability. The dual requirement to achieve both numerical stability and minimal numerical dissipation are often conflicting for existing shock capturing schemes for flows with turbulence and discontinuities or stiff source terms.  During the last decade, Wang et al., Yee et al., Sjogreen & Yee have developed highly accurate structure preserving numerical methods with very small numerical dissipation that maintain nonlinear stability for compressible turbulence with strong shocks. This talk gives a brief overview of the quantification of numerical uncertainty via a nonlinear dynamics approach to complement existing uncertainty quantification in numerical simulations.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75418' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk593' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(593)' class='star'><span class='star593'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G106)</b> Siva Nadarajah, Kinetic Energy Preservation and Entropy Stable Modal Flux Reconstruction Formulations <span id='bitlink-551'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(551)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-551' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(551)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Kinetic Energy Preservation and Entropy Stable Modal Flux Reconstruction Formulations</b><br />Siva Nadarajah<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-130.html'>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>The flux reconstruction method has gained popularity in the research community as it recovers promising high-order methods through modally filtered correction fields, such as the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, on unstructured grids over complex geometries. Under a class of energy stable flux reconstruction (ESFR) schemes also known as Vincent-Castonguay-Jameson-Huynh (VCJH) schemes, the flux reconstruction method allows for larger time-steps than DG while ensuring linear stability on linear elements. Alternatively, for nonlinear problems, split forms emerged as the popular approach proving nonlinear stability for unsteady problems on coarse unstructured grids; albeit only having been proved for the strong form DG scheme and numerically shown for the $g_2$-lumped Lobatto strong form ESFR scheme for the Euler equations. Incorporating split forms with VCJH schemes, alike Ranocha and Abe, generally lead to unstable discretizations.  Over the past year we have developed a new Nonlinearly Stable Flux Reconstruction approach based on modal uncollocated ESFR schemes in split forms that ensure energy and entropy stability. This new approach simplifies to VCJH type schemes for linear problems, but for nonlinear problems, it ensures nonlinear stability and the correct orders of convergence. In this work, we show analytically that with a suitable interface flux the scheme guarantees kinetic energy preservation for the stated Nonlinearly Stable Flux Reconstruction framework.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75418' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk594' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(594)' class='star'><span class='star594'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G106)</b> Remi Abgrall, High Order Approximation of Non Linear Hyperbolic Systems by Mean of a Virtual Finite Element <span id='bitlink-552'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(552)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-552' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(552)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High Order Approximation of Non Linear Hyperbolic Systems by Mean of a Virtual Finite Element</b><br />Remi Abgrall<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-130.html'>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>There exist many ways of approximating non linear hyperbolic problems: finite difference (FD), continuous finite elements (CFEM), discontinuous Galerkin method (dG), finite volume (FV), Residual distribution methods (RD), etc. All rely, in a manner or another, on an explicit representation of the numerical solution, either on a stencil (FD), or within an element (all the others), and then from this one compute the elements of the scheme by differenciating basis functions, or reconstructing the variables by means of polynomials.      
If this strategy is very successful, this paper intends to go beyong, by following ideas arising from the Virtual Finite Elements methods (VEM) introduced by Bezzi and his collaborators a few years ago. Here also, even for polygonal meshes, the solution is thought as globaly continuous. No explicit representation of the solution is introduced, only its polynomials approximation on the polygonal elements that compose the mesh, and some moments of the solution. We will describe several methods to achieve this goal, for the compressible Euler equations.    
Our method has several common points with the Active Flux method developped recently by Roe et al. It has also several differences, in particular a wider flexibility in the choices of variables, as well as the shape of the elements.

The proposed numerical scheme is applied to compute/approximate the different critical values of the transition parameter. The aim of the study is to provide highly-accurate reliable results, given the scarcity of proven accurate results in the literature. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed algorithm has the capability of accurately computing the solutions of the three-dimensional Bratu problem, as well as the critical values of the transition parameter. Furthermore, the bifurcated behavior of the solution is presented by investigating the infinity norm of the solution for different values of the transition parameter.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75418' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

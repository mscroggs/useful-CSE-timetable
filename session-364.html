The method -- unlike many variational inference approaches - avoids explicitly parametrizing posterior approximations. Instead, approximations are formulated implicitly as a sequence of measure transports starting from the prior distribution. In this work, we aim at repurposing SVGD for estimating rare event probabilities in the order of $10^{-3} -- 10^{-10}$. We use importance sampling (IS) and employ SVGD to approximate the optimal importance sampling density. The latter is straight-forward based on a well-known analogy between sampling from Bayesian posteriors and optimal IS distributions: the indicator function of the rare event is treated as the likelihood and estimating the rare event probability amounts to estimating the marginal likelihood or model evidence. In order to avoid non-smooth (indicator) likelihoods, we employ a smooth approximation of the rare event indicator function. We discuss the choice of the smooth indicator approximation and adaptively choosing the smoothing parameter appearing therein, which yields a rare event pendant to annealed SVGD approaches for Bayesian inference. Several examples are used to benchmark the efficacy of our approach against state-of-the-art methods for estimating rare event probabilities.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75800' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1647' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1647)' class='star'><span class='star1647'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:40 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (D407)</b> Aleksei Sorokin, Adaptive Failure Probability Estimation with Gaussian Processes <span id='bitlink-1511'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1511)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1511' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1511)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Failure Probability Estimation with Gaussian Processes</b><br />Aleksei Sorokin<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-364.html'>Simulation-Based UQ Methods - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>Efficiently approximating the probability of system failure has gained increasing importance as expensive simulations begin to play a larger role in reliability quantification tasks in areas such as structural design, power grid testing, and safety certification among others. This work develops an adaptive approximation scheme for efficiently quantifying the probability a simulation exceeds a given failure threshold subject to a prior distribution on system parameters. Our method iteratively updates a Gaussian process by IID sampling from a density proportional to the pointwise expected-weighted-misclassification-rate. Probabilistic error bounds are derived to enable an adaptive stopping criterion. We show this method achieves the same error as standard Monte Carlo techniques using substantially fewer simulations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75800' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1648' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1648)' class='star'><span class='star1648'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D407)</b> Anirudh Subramanyam, Identification of Network Vulnerabilities to Cascading Failures <span id='bitlink-1512'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1512)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1512' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1512)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Identification of Network Vulnerabilities to Cascading Failures</b><br />Anirudh Subramanyam<br />Friday, March 3 10:05 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-364.html'>Simulation-Based UQ Methods - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>Measures of power grid vulnerability are often assessed by the amount of direct and instantaneous damage an adversary can exact on the network. The cascading impact of such attacks is often overlooked, even though it is well known that cascades are one of the primary causes of large-scale blackouts. This paper explores modifications of the power network's transmission line flow thresholds as candidates for adversarial attacks, which are undetectable as long as they don't affect line flows at equilibrium. This forms the basis of a black-box function in a Bayesian optimization procedure, where the goal is to find line threshold settings that maximize cascade damage. Notably, the proposed method is agnostic to the choice of underlying cascade simulator. Extensive experiments conducted using a recently developed quasi-steady state cascade simulator reveal that, contrary to what one might expect, the most restrictive thresholds do not necessarily produce the most damaging cascades. More surprisingly, even in a limited resource setting where attacks are resource-constrained, one can find attacks that produce cascades comparable in severity to those found when there are no resource constraints.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75800' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1649' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1649)' class='star'><span class='star1649'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D407)</b> Sean Reiter, Power System Event Location via DEIM <span id='bitlink-1513'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1513)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1513' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1513)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Power System Event Location via DEIM</b><br />Sean Reiter<br />Friday, March 3 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-364.html'>Simulation-Based UQ Methods - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>Real-time event analysis is critical for the successful security and operation of electrical power systems. Gone unchecked, local disturbances can cascade into wide area failures (see e.g., the 2003 Northeastern United States blackout). Data-driven analysis techniques based on low-rank matrix factorizations of system measurements have gained popularity in recent years due to the increased deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs). In this talk, we introduce a selection procedure for locating the source power system events from real-time data based on the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM). The DEIM selection algorithm parses the dominant singular vectors of the collected measurements in order to select a set of representative row indices, each corresponding to measurements at a particular bus. These selected indices serve as a proxy for identifying the buses most affected by an event, and locate the source of the initial fault with high accuracy. Numerical results involving synthetically generated PMU data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75800' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

<h2>Quantum Computing for Engineering Applications - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1027' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1027)' class='star'><span class='star1027'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM (D403)</b> Oleksandr Kyriienko, Quantum Algorithms for Scientific Machine Learning and Solving Differential Equations <span id='bitlink-946'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(946)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-946' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(946)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quantum Algorithms for Scientific Machine Learning and Solving Differential Equations</b><br />Oleksandr Kyriienko<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-225.html'>Quantum Computing for Engineering Applications - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>In the talk, I will discuss the advances in the field of quantum scientific computing. This is based on the series of works for solving differential equations for applications in fluid dynamics and generative modelling. First, I will show how to differentiate quantum circuits with feature maps and embed derivatives of multidimensional functions. This approach relies on automatic differentiation to represent derivatives in an analytical form, thus avoiding inaccurate finite difference procedures. We refer to the underlying circuits as derivative quantum circuits (DQCs). I will describe the proposed hybrid quantum-classical workflow where DQCs are trained to satisfy nonlinear differential equations and specified boundary conditions. As an example, I will apply the algorithm to solve a problem from computational fluid dynamics. This corresponds to the fluid flow in a convergent-divergent nozzle (described by Navier-Stokes equations), where we predict density, temperature and velocity profiles for the stiff system of equations that can challenge classical solvers. Second, I will also show that DQCs can provide an advantage for generative modelling from stochastic differential equations, giving access to sampling from financially relevant models. Finally, I will discuss the protocols that may be scaled to treat large industrial problems in the future.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75547' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1029' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1029)' class='star'><span class='star1029'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (D403)</b> Marcin Dukalski, Early Applications of Quantum Computing to Subsurface Imaging <span id='bitlink-947'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(947)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-947' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(947)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Early Applications of Quantum Computing to Subsurface Imaging</b><br />Marcin Dukalski<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-225.html'>Quantum Computing for Engineering Applications - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>We show an application of quantum annealing to solving an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem encountered on land, where strength and timing of scattered waves is used to generate the subsurface image.     
Geological anomalies such as underground rivers, caves, or boulders, have different wave propagation velocity than their surroundings.  This results in abrupt local misalignment in arrival times of detected waves. This can blur the image and misrepresent the geological information. Optimizing the relative alignment of the measurements is described by a multi-modal objective function. Getting stuck in local optima is common, and often a second best optimum, far away in parameter space, gives a false sense of certainty about the subsurface. Solving this conceptually simple, yet mathematically challenging, problem has far reaching implications to the economics of civil engineering, hydrology, gas storage and hydrocarbon exploration.    
We convert the classical optimization to a Discrete Quadratic Model, and through various discrete (classical) variable to qubit encodings to a Binary Quadratic Optimization and its constraints. We discuss how a custom hybrid classical-quantum workflow enables us to solve problems nearing business-relevance and show how the encodings influence the output generated by the 5000-qubit quantum annealer. We discuss some features of this application which could help establishing other use cases in similar disciplines.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75547' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1030' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1030)' class='star'><span class='star1030'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (D403)</b> Giorgio Balducci, Predicting Composite Structures Failure with the Help of Quantum Neural Networks <span id='bitlink-948'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(948)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-948' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(948)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Predicting Composite Structures Failure with the Help of Quantum Neural Networks</b><br />Giorgio Balducci<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-225.html'>Quantum Computing for Engineering Applications - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>Composite materials failure entails many physical phenomena, which make its prediction challenging from a computational standpoint. Especially in a design context, where material properties, geometry and stacking sequence are varied, the computing time required by the finite element analyses becomes prohibitive. This has motivated the idea of data-driven composite failure prediction, where a data-based model learns from relatively few numerical simulations and it can later generalize to unseen input (e.g. loading) conditions.    
Even though most machine learning models are trained on classical computers, quantum computers can also learn from data. In fact, operations on quantum bits are continuous and can be tuned in a hybrid quantum-classical optimization loop. Since the model is a quantum circuit, it is evaluated on quantum hardware, while the parameters are updated classically.    
Thanks to the properties of quantum mechanics, quantum models proved able to learn functions that classical machine learning models cannot learn, especially in classification tasks. However, the datasets used were 'fabricated' such to be easily classified by the quantum circuit.    
As one of the first practical applications, this work explored the power of quantum machine learning models in the practical scenario of learning composite structures failure and compared it to that of classical data-driven models.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75547' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

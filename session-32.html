<h2>Multi-Fidelity Methods for Uncertainty Quantification and Optimization - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk143' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(143)' class='star'><span class='star143'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM (E105)</b> Bj&#246;rn Sprungk, Towards Multilevel Slice Sampling <span id='bitlink-135'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(135)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-135' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(135)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards Multilevel Slice Sampling</b><br />Bj&#246;rn Sprungk<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-32.html'>Multi-Fidelity Methods for Uncertainty Quantification and Optimization - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>For sampling approximately a partially known distribution, e.g., posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems, the slice sampling methodology provides a machinery for the design and simulation of a suitable Markov chain without the necessity to tune any parameters as in many Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. In the machine learning community slice sampling is a frequently used approach, which appears not only there as standard sampling tool. In particular, the elliptical slice sampler attracted in the last decade considerable attention as a dimension-robust algorithm. However, from a theoretical point of view it is not well understood.   In this talk, we present theoretical results regarding the geometric ergodicity of Markov chains generated by elliptical slice sampling as well as simple slice sampling. Moreover, we outline how multilevel or multifidelity ideas can be combined with (elliptical) slice sampling in order to reduce the (usually) significant computational cost of this promising Markov chain Monte Carlo method.

The method requires solving the OCP for several low-fidelity spatial grids and quadrature formulae for the objective functional. All the computed solutions are then linearly combined to get a final approximation which, under suitable regularity assumptions, preserves the same accuracy of fine tensor product approximations, while drastically reducing the computational cost. The combination technique involves only tensor product quadrature formulae, thus the discretized OCPs preserve the convexity of the continuous OCP. Hence, the combination technique avoids the inconveniences of Multilevel Monte Carlo and/or sparse grids approaches, but remains suitable for high dimensional problems.  We will present an a-priori procedure to choose the most important mixed differences and an asymptotic convergence analysis, which states that the asymptotic convergence rate is exclusively determined by the spatial solver. Numerical experiments validate the results.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75248' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk145' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(145)' class='star'><span class='star145'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (E105)</b> Thomas Dixon, Multi-Output Approximate Control Variates for Trajectory Optimization <span id='bitlink-137'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(137)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-137' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(137)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multi-Output Approximate Control Variates for Trajectory Optimization</b><br />Thomas Dixon<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-32.html'>Multi-Fidelity Methods for Uncertainty Quantification and Optimization - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Monte Carlo estimators with many Quantities of Interest (QoIs) can often lead to an extremely high computational burden. Variance reduction approaches are critically needed to reduce the cost of analysis in computationally expensive models. By using multiple models of varying fidelity, a control variate estimator can significantly reduce the variance of an estimator for one QoI using the correlation between the models. However, with many QoIs, a vast majority of approaches use multiple independent control variate estimators for each QoI.  In this talk, we develop a multi-output approximate control variate estimator and show that it outperforms a set of multiple single-output control variate estimators. Overall, it significantly reduces the cost of analysis by additionally extracting correlations amongst multiple model outputs. We demonstrate our technique on applications in flight trajectory estimation in simulations of entry, descent, and landing. Also, using highly correlated QoIs, examples will be shown that significantly surpass current state-of-the-art techniques.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75248' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk146' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(146)' class='star'><span class='star146'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:40 AM&ndash;12:55 AM (E105)</b> Matteo Diez, Benchmarking Multi-Fidelity Optimization Methods: Recent Experiences and Lesson Learned <span id='bitlink-138'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(138)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-138' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(138)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Benchmarking Multi-Fidelity Optimization Methods: Recent Experiences and Lesson Learned</b><br />Matteo Diez<br />Friday, March 3 12:40 AM&ndash;12:55 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-32.html'>Multi-Fidelity Methods for Uncertainty Quantification and Optimization - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>The talk overviews the efforts of the AVT-331 technical team under the NATO STO Applied Vehicle Technology Panel, which is studying multi-fidelity methods through application to vehicle design. The objectives of the team are to understand the potential benefits of multi-fidelity methods in vehicle design and to document the relative strengths and weaknesses of different multi-fidelity methods using a common benchmark suite developed by the team.  The benchmark suite has multiple levels of complexity, beginning with analytic functions with well-understood properties and culminating with representative air and sea vehicle benchmarks.  The suite also includes intermediate complexity benchmarks of relevance to air, sea, and space vehicles.  Benchmark features are presented, including descriptions of benchmark objectives, and enabling software needed to reproduce vehicle-level results, as well as experimental setup for analytic benchmarks. The principal multi-fidelity methods utilized across the team are also summarized. Lastly, the process is described by which the relative strengths and weaknesses of different multi-fidelity methods is assessed over eight assessment categories.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75248' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

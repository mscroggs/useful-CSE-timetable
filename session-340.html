They issue growth factors that are felt in nearby blood vessels and stimulate the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) that carry the needed oxygen and nutrients to the tumor. Epithelial cells in move collectively to close a wound or collectively push an epithelial monolayer of a different tissue. Aspects of these multiscale processes in biomedicine can be studied by mathematical and computational models. We discuss angiogenesis at supracellular scales by stochastic differential equations and birth-death processes, derive continuum descriptions of the density of moving blood vessels and analyse a soliton-like attractor. Numerical simulations of a cellular Potts model including Notch signaling between cells describe the growth of blood vessels at cellular and subcellular levels.    
Collective cellular motion of epithelial cells can be described using simpler active vertex models, in which cells are polygons forming a Voronoi tessellation of the tissue. The dual Delaunay triangulation comprises cells centers that evolve according to dynamics including collective inertia and active forces. Numerical simulations qualitatively agree with experiments on wound healing assays, formation of fingers, and antagonistic migration assays of a precancerous cellular aggregate invading the space of a healthy tissue and displacing its cells.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75749' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1544' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1544)' class='star'><span class='star1544'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (Emerald Room)</b> Aviv Gibali, Optimization in Radiotherapy <span id='bitlink-1418'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1418)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1418' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1418)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimization in Radiotherapy</b><br />Aviv Gibali<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-340.html'>ECMI: Perspectives and Successes of Mathematical Challenges in Industrial Applications  - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>In this talk I will provide an overview of models and algorithms in the field of radiotherapy from optimization and feasibility aspects.

In collaboration with many other scientists, we have worked intensively with policy-makers to fight the pandemic. I will present an overview of our pandemic-related research: a) A new modelling framework (Lau et al, Proc. R. Soc. A, 2022) for the airborne transmission of viruses that quickly determines the infection risk in an indoor space, as ventilation changes. The model agrees well with real superspreading events during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be used in future epidemics. b) An agent-based modelling framework (Moore et al, COVID, 2021) that allows quick decision-making and comparison of mitigations in educational settings. We find that, although frequent testing can be used to reduce the number of infected students, investment in masks and ventilation is more effective. c) Modelling air purifiers. Air purifiers can be used to improve ventilation and reduce infection risk from SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in indoor spaces. It is, however, frequently not clear where to place them and how strong they should be. Hence, deploying them to schools, hospitals and other spaces poses interesting challenges for policy-makers and managers of spaces. We provide solutions to some of these challenges.

The goal of holding global warming “to well below 2°C” (IPCC 2018; Paris Agreement 2015), can now only be achieved through the extraction of atmospheric greenhouse gases in tandem with emission reductions and a range of other measures. Similarly the goal of a “toxic free environment” requires the removal of a multitude of existing contaminants.  The focus of this talk will be the development and solution of mathematical models for the removal of contaminants by column sorption. Column sorption involves passing a contaminated fluid through a porous media contained in a column. The contaminants are adsorbed by the porous media. This is a common process, capable of removing a multitude of contaminants. However, industrial use is restricted due to a large increase in running costs. Further, laboratory experiments on small scale equipment, a necessary precursor to building the full size version, do not scale up in the predicted manner.  The mathematical description of column sorption involves coupling advection-diffusion equations to sink (removal) equations, all applied over an evolving domain. In the talk we will describe our modelling, analytical and numerical solution techniques as well as experiments currently being employed to help improve and optimise this process.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75749' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

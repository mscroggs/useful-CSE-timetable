In particular, we supplement and complete  the theory of error bounds for model order reduction of stochastic differential equations. With these error bounds, we establish a link between the output error for stochastic systems (with additive and  multiplicative noise) and modified versions of the $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm for both linear and bilinear deterministic systems. When deriving the respective optimality conditions for minimizing the error bounds, we will  see that model order reduction techniques related to iterative rational Krylov algorithms (IRKA) are very natural and effective methods for reducing the dimension of large-scale stochastic systems with  additive and/or multiplicative noise. We apply modified versions of (linear and bilinear) IRKA to stochastic linear systems and show their efficiency in numerical experiments.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75470' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk782' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(782)' class='star'><span class='star782'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM (G111)</b> Martin Redmann, Optimization-Based Model Order Reduction with Applications in Finance <span id='bitlink-727'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(727)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-727' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(727)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimization-Based Model Order Reduction with Applications in Finance</b><br />Martin Redmann<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-171.html'>The Interplay of MOR and Optimization in Modern Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>Solving optimal stopping problems by backward induction in high dimensions is often very complex since the computation of conditional expectations is required. Typically, such computations are based on regression, a method that suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, the objective of this talk is to establish dimension reduction schemes for large-scale asset price models and to solve related optimal stopping problems (e.g. Bermudan option pricing) in the reduced setting, where regression is feasible. The proposed algorithm is based on an error measure between linear stochastic differential equations. We establish optimality conditions for this error measure with respect to the reduce system coefficients and propose a particular method that satisfies these conditions up to a small deviation. We illustrate the benefit of our approach in several numerical experiments, in which Bermudan option prices are determined.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75470' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk783' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(783)' class='star'><span class='star783'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM (G111)</b> Quirin Aumann, Adaptive Choice of Near-Optimal Expansion Points for Interpolation-Based Reduced Order Modeling <span id='bitlink-728'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(728)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-728' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(728)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Choice of Near-Optimal Expansion Points for Interpolation-Based Reduced Order Modeling</b><br />Quirin Aumann<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-171.html'>The Interplay of MOR and Optimization in Modern Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>Interpolation-based methods are well-established and effective  approaches for the efficient generation of accurate reduced-order  surrogate models.  Common challenges for such methods are the automatic  choice of good or even optimal interpolation points as well as a  suitable size for the reduced-order model.  An approach that tackles the first problem for linear, unstructured  systems is the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA), which  computes optimal interpolation points by iterative updates solving  linear eigenvalue problems.  However, in the case of structured systems, the eigenvalue problems  resulting from the corresponding transfer functions are nonlinear  such that the number of potential new interpolation points exceeds  the order of the reduced model.  In our work, we propose an IRKA-inspired iterative interpolation method  for structured systems to compute near-optimal interpolation points  as well as a suitable size for the reduced-order model.  Thereby, the iterative updates of the expansion points are chosen   to yield accurate approximations in specified frequency ranges of  interest.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75470' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk784' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(784)' class='star'><span class='star784'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM (G111)</b> Zoran Tomljanovic, Damping Optimization of the Excited Mechanical System Using Dimension Reduction <span id='bitlink-729'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(729)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-729' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(729)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Damping Optimization of the Excited Mechanical System Using Dimension Reduction</b><br />Zoran Tomljanovic<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-171.html'>The Interplay of MOR and Optimization in Modern Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>In this work a mechanical system excited by a periodic external force is considered. The main problem is to determine the best damping matrix to be able to minimize the system average displacement amplitude. Damping optimization usually includes optimization of damping positions and corresponding damping viscosities.  Since the objective function is non-convex, a standard optimization approach typically requires a large number of objective function evaluations. We first propose a  dimension reduction approach that calculates approximation of the average displacement amplitude and additionally we efficiently use a low rank update structure that appears in the external damping matrix. Moreover, an error bound which allows determination of appropriate approximation orders is derived and  incorporated within the optimization method. We also present a theoretical error bound that allows determination of effective damping positions. The methodology proposed here provides a significant acceleration of the optimization process. The gain in efficiency is illustrated in numerical experiments.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75470' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk785' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(785)' class='star'><span class='star785'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM (G111)</b> Matthias Heinkenschloss, Certified Optimization with Reduced Order Models <span id='bitlink-730'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(730)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-730' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(730)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Certified Optimization with Reduced Order Models</b><br />Matthias Heinkenschloss<br />Friday, March 3 10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-171.html'>The Interplay of MOR and Optimization in Modern Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>This talk presents new approaches for the optimization of expensive large-scale optimization problems using reduced order models (ROMs). The fundamental idea is to approximate computationally expensive evaluations of objective and constraint functions and derivatives by inexpensive ROMs. The challenge is that ROMs need to be adjusted during the optimization process, and that only asymptotic ROM error bounds are available. New trust-region and line search based optimization approaches and their integration with efficient ROM contructions are presented that are implementable when only asymptotic ROM error bounds are available and have proven convergence properties.

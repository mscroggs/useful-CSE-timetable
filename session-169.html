<h2>Advances in High Performance Computing for Earth Science - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk772' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(772)' class='star'><span class='star772'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:30 AM&ndash;11:41 AM (E102)</b> Nils Wedi, DestinE - Digital Twins of the Earth System <span id='bitlink-718'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(718)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-718' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(718)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>DestinE - Digital Twins of the Earth System</b><br />Nils Wedi<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:41 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-169.html'>Advances in High Performance Computing for Earth Science - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>As part of the European Commission's Destination Earth programme, global, coupled storm-resolving simulations can contribute to building digital replicas of Earth, thanks to recent advances in Earth system modelling, supercomputing and the adaptation of weather and climate codes for novel computing architectures. Combined with novel data-driven deep learning advances, this offers a window into the future, with a promise to significantly increase the timeliness and realism of Earth system information. Despite the significant compute and data challenges, there is a real prospect to better support global to local climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, and complement today's existing information. Digital Twins of Earth thus encapsulate both the latest science as well as technology advances to provide near-real time information on Extremes and climate change in a wider digital environment. Here users can interact, modify and ultimately create or complement their own tailored information. Partnering with ESA and EUMETSAT, this is facilitated through complex workflows akin to a game engine environment provided by ECMWF's digital twin engine that closely connects EuroHPC resources for the production of and access to digital twin data. The underlying system architecture and design choices will be described and justified.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75468' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk774' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(774)' class='star'><span class='star774'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:46 AM&ndash;11:57 AM (E102)</b> Simone Silvestri, Global Ocean Modeling on GPUs with Julia <span id='bitlink-719'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(719)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-719' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(719)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Global Ocean Modeling on GPUs with Julia</b><br />Simone Silvestri<br />Friday, March 3 11:46 AM&ndash;11:57 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-169.html'>Advances in High Performance Computing for Earth Science - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we examine the performance of the open-source Oceananigans.jl software in modeling low to high-resolution large-scale ocean simulations. The software is written entirely in the Julia programming language and uses a rich system of abstractions not easily implemented in the traditional languages of climate science, such as Fortran and C. Additionally, by leveraging the Julia infrastructure, Oceananigans allows switching the computation between CPU and GPU architectures seamlessly, making it the perfect tool to prototype, test, and run large-scale ocean simulations. We demonstrate the usability and the performance of Oceananigans by integrating two relevant global setups, an eddy-permitting simulation at a 0.25-degree resolution and an eddy-resolving one at a 0.1-degree resolution. While the former fits entirely on one gaming-grade GPU, the latter requires parallelizing the computation on a minimum of three scientific programming GPUs. We examine the software's scalability and accuracy along with the performance for both test cases, showing optimal results compared to state-of-the-art ocean models. We argue that it is primarily the use of Julia that allows us to implement a high-level model that is easy and engaging but also attains good scaling and absolute performance on large-scale climate problems.

This has led to a better understanding of the Earth's climate, and CMIP model experiments have routinely been the basis for future climate change assessments made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).    
Along with all other aspects of the workflow for the sixth phase, CMIP6, the Earth System Documentation (ES-DOC) project manages the creation, analysis and dissemination of documentation about the computing platform used to run the various ensembles of simulations and their representative performance for the given hardware and CMIP6 model and experiment, with a dedicated eco-system of tools. The computational performance evaluation is characterised by the CPMIP Metrics, a set of measures specifically designed to capture the actual performance of Earth System Models (ESMs).    
We present an overview of the results of all present submissions by modelling groups towards CMIP6 machine and performance documentation coordinated by ES-DOC, whilst describing the challenges of collecting and communicating such information. We briefly look to the past and future with regards to the realities and importance of this task, for example thinking ahead to CMIP7.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75468' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk2049' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2049)' class='star'><span class='star2049'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:18 AM&ndash;12:29 AM (E102)</b> Stella Paronuzzi, High Performance Computing Challenges for Destination Earth:  the Climate Change Adaptation Digital Twin <span id='bitlink-1875'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1875)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1875' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1875)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High Performance Computing Challenges for Destination Earth:  the Climate Change Adaptation Digital Twin</b><br />Stella Paronuzzi<br />Friday, March 3 12:18 AM&ndash;12:29 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-169.html'>Advances in High Performance Computing for Earth Science - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>Climate change is expected to have far reaching impacts on human and natural systems during the 21stcentury. To guide policy decisions on climate change adaptation and mitigation, there is a need for developing new types of climate information systems that can provide timely information on regional and local impacts of climate change. The European Commission’s Destination Earth (DestinE) programme aims towards this by developing high precision digital twins (DT) of the Earth. In this presentation we will focus on one of the two first priority DTs, the Climate Change Adaptation DT. The climate DT system will be developed around two of Europe’s leading ESMs, ICON and IFS-FESOM/NEMO. These models, which are the nucleus of the Horizon 2020 NextGEMS (Next Generation Earth Modeling Systems) project, are the only global models within Europe with a demonstrated ability to run coupled to an ocean at scales finer than 5 km globally. They have been benchmarked on the largest computing systems presently available within Europe, and will be adapted to two of Europe’s largest computing infrastructures coming online in the next months: MareNostrum 5 at the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre, and LUMI operated by the CSC–IT Center for Science. We will describe the first stage of this adaptation and will present future plans for running these global simulations efficiently at kilometer scales.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75468' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk776' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(776)' class='star'><span class='star776'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:34 AM&ndash;12:45 AM (E102)</b> Mostafa Mousavi, Deep Learning of Seismograms <span id='bitlink-721'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(721)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-721' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(721)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Learning of Seismograms</b><br />Mostafa Mousavi<br />Friday, March 3 12:34 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-169.html'>Advances in High Performance Computing for Earth Science - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>Seismology is a data-rich and data-driven science in which the application of machine learning (ML) techniques has been growing rapidly. Among the various ML techniques, seismologists quickly recognized and realized the potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) to address a broad array of seismological applications. Much of this is due to the availability of large-scale datasets and the suitability of deep-learning techniques for seismic data processing; however, some aspects of applying AI to seismology are likely to prove instructive for geosciences more broadly. Deep learning is a powerful approach, but its application has subtleties and nuances. I will present a systematic overview of trends, challenges, and opportunities in applications of deep-learning methods in seismology.

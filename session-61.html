<h2>Exploring Complexity in Life Sciences with Modeling and Simulations - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk276' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(276)' class='star'><span class='star276'>&star;</span></a> <b>1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM (D507)</b> Francesca Cavallini, Stochastic Collocation for Neural Field Equations with Random Data <span id='bitlink-257'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(257)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-257' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(257)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stochastic Collocation for Neural Field Equations with Random Data</b><br />Francesca Cavallini<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-61.html'>Exploring Complexity in Life Sciences with Modeling and Simulations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Neural fields equations model the activity of the brain cortex subject to an external stimulus. These spatially-extended dynamical systems are specified by modelling brain characteristics such as the synaptic kernel and firing rate of neurons, which are generally only partially available in experiments. Tools from uncertainty quantification are key to understanding neuronal behaviour and making predictions of how the brain responds to external stimuli, crucial problem in healthcare and biological applications.    
Motivated by these considerations, we build a numerical scheme for neural fields with random data (input, synaptic kernel, firing rate, or initial conditions) producing a pointwise approximation of the expectation and variance of neural activity at any space-time coordinate. Our approach consists in casting the system into a set of ODEs on a Banach space, and using a two steps scheme to approximate the solutionâ€™s mean and variance. The implemented algorithm performs a spatial projection followed by a stochastic projection. In this talk, we explain and motivate possible choices for the projectors (interpolator and orthogonal) and the corresponding quadrature rules to approximate the integrals. In particular, we demonstrate optimal convergence of stochastic collocation analytically and present numerical results.

While a number of studies have shown that differential equation models can be successfully identified when the data are sufficiently detailed and corrupted with relatively small amounts of noise, the relationship between observation noise and uncertainty in the learned differential equation models remains unexplored. We demonstrate that for noisy data sets there exists great variation in both the structure of the learned differential equation models as well as the parameter values. We explore how to combine data sets to quantify uncertainty in the learned models, and at the same time draw mechanistic conclusions about the target differential equations. We generate noisy data using a stochastic agent-based model and combine equation learning methods with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to show that the correct differential equation model can be successfully learned from data, while a quantification of uncertainty is given by a posterior distribution in parameter space.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75299' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk278' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(278)' class='star'><span class='star278'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (D507)</b> Iuliu Sorin Pop, An Adaptive, Two-Scale Scheme for Precipitation-Dissolution Models in Porous Media with Evolving Pore-Scale Geometry <span id='bitlink-259'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(259)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-259' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(259)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Adaptive, Two-Scale Scheme for Precipitation-Dissolution Models in Porous Media with Evolving Pore-Scale Geometry</b><br />Iuliu Sorin Pop<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-61.html'>Exploring Complexity in Life Sciences with Modeling and Simulations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>We consider a two-scale model for precipitation and dissolution processes in a porous medium. Such processes determine a micro-structural evolution, leading to free boundaries separating the fluid from the solid inside each pore. This evolution impacts the flow, which, on its turn, affects the solute transport, the precipitation/dissolution processes and, ultimately, the micro-scale geometry.     
To avoid difficulties related to the evolving geometry inside pores, we propose a phase-field pore-scale model. Employing formal homogenization, a two-scale model is derived, in which the pore-scale and the Darcy-scale model components are coupled through the cell problems, providing the effective parameters. For the resulting model, we discuss an adaptive two-scale scheme. It involves iterations between the scales, linear iterations for solving the nonlinear cell problems, an adaptive selection of the elements wherein the effective parameters are computed, and adaptive mesh refinement.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75299' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk279' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(279)' class='star'><span class='star279'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (D507)</b> Roeland Merks, Modeling Cell Behavior with Hybrid Cellular Potts and Continuum Models <span id='bitlink-260'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(260)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-260' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(260)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Modeling Cell Behavior with Hybrid Cellular Potts and Continuum Models</b><br />Roeland Merks<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-61.html'>Exploring Complexity in Life Sciences with Modeling and Simulations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>To form the patterns and behaviors that we see in multicellular development, cells must carefully coordinate their behavior through biophysical and biochemical cues. Numerical modeling and theory are essential tools for analyzing the mechanism of such coordinated, collective cell behavior. To do so, single-cell models must be sufficiently detailed so they correctly capture essential aspects of individual cells and do not oversimplify. At the same time, single-cell models must be sufficiently simple and computationally efficient so they can be upscaled to multicellular systems. Here I will present a series of our recent hybrid cellular Potts models for modeling individual cell behavior, and show how these can be used to study the coordinated cell behavior that is seen in biological development. I will discuss single cell models used to analyze observations such as anomalous cell migration patterns of immune cells, mechanical cell and extracellular matrix interactions, and models of anisotropic force generation. I will end by presenting stategies for using these hybrid CPMs to study collective cell behavior.

A 2017 survey was used for the analysis, with the major events occurring between 2012 and 2017. Using R software, an analysis using logistic regression approaches was performed to assess the impact of socioeconomic and proximate factors on infant mortality.  The dependent variable of the study was whether the infant was alive or dead, while the independent variables were divided into socioeconomic and proximate factors.  According to the findings, some proximate factors have a significant connection with whether the infant is dead or living. The child's weight had a strong relationship with whether the child was alive or dead. The sex of the newborn was the final proximate factor that showed a significant connection with the child being dead or alive.  In the Ashanti Region, most of the neonatal deaths were due to low birth weight. Also, 62.7% of the babies that died were males.  The study revealed that if the significant elements under the proximate factors are considered, newborn mortality will be reduced.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75299' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

It provides hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares by sampling the Fourier transform of the incoming photon flux. With the first real observations, called visibilities, we analyze two imaging methods: the first one is an enhanced interpolation/extrapolation algorithm based on data-driven fitting, while the second one is a parametric imaging approach.

The problem of nowcasting extreme weather events can be addressed by applying either numerical methods for the solution of dynamic model equations or data-driven artificial intelligence techniques.  In this talk, we focus on this second approach. In detail, we present   a novel method based on ensemble deep learning that exploits a deep neural network that takes as input time series of multichannel radar reflectivity images and provides as output the probability that an extreme event occurs, where the extreme event is defined on the basis of a certain level of precipitation and lightning density. One of the main novelty is the   use of value-weighted skill scores in the ensemble procedure and for assessing the forecasting performance: such value-weighted skill scores allow ranking prediction errors on the basis of their distribution along time, preferring to show up a warning well in advance of the actual   occurrence of an event rather than not to show it at all. The results of this study is a data-driven warning system for supporting the decision-making in the case of extreme rainfall events tailored for the Liguria region in Italy.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75834' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1720' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1720)' class='star'><span class='star1720'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G110)</b> Chih-Chi Hu, An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) Using the Particle Flow Filter (PFF) in a High-Dimensional Atmospheric Model in the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) <span id='bitlink-1577'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1577)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1577' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1577)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) Using the Particle Flow Filter (PFF) in a High-Dimensional Atmospheric Model in the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART)</b><br />Chih-Chi Hu<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-380.html'>High-Fidelity and Data-Driven Methods for Multiscale and Multi-Physics Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Representing the true state of the atmosphere is a very difficult task.   In the modern weather forecasting, satellite based observations are assimilated into the numerical model in order to obtain a more realistic representation of the atmosphere in the model. This process is called “data assimilation (DA)”.     
DA plays an important role in constraining the model heavily with observations. However, due to the high dimension of the atmospheric model, many DA methods are developed based on either Gaussian or linear assumptions, which are not applicable for some types of observations. Recently, a more general DA method, the Particle Flow Filter (PFF), is proposed to deal with the nonlinear observations and has been shown to work effectively in high dimensional models. With some modifications of the algorithm, the PFF can be adapted to run efficiently in the Data Assimilation Research Testbed  (DART) framework and is now able to run in parallel.    
We will demonstrate an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) using an atmospheric model which has nonlinear interactions between dynamics and  thermodynamics. Specifically, the performance of the DA using the PFF will be compared with using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), which is a widely used DA scheme based on linear and Gaussian assumptions. Discussions will be focused on how the PFF and the EAKF deal with the nonlinear observations differently, and how these differences can affect the model behavior.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75834' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1722' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1722)' class='star'><span class='star1722'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G110)</b> Alexander Stone, Machine Learning Methods For Numerical Homogenization <span id='bitlink-1579'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1579)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1579' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1579)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Machine Learning Methods For Numerical Homogenization</b><br />Alexander Stone<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-380.html'>High-Fidelity and Data-Driven Methods for Multiscale and Multi-Physics Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>The numerical solution to partial differential equations with multiscale data poses significant computational difficulties. Choosing a mesh scale that is too fine can lead to slow convergence or an intractable problem size. Alternatively, too coarse a mesh scale and features of the PDE will go unresolved, yielding an incorrect solution. Methods of numerical homogenization address these by creating an effective model defined at the macro scale by propagating relevant information from the fine space to the coarse space. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art homogenization approaches are sensitive to individual PDE configurations. We propose machine learning methods to construct effective models that are more robust and efficient. Our approach investigates linear and nonlinear models with $L_1$ sparsity enforcing penalties on heterogeneous PDEs without relying on separable scales or periodicity.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75834' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1721' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1721)' class='star'><span class='star1721'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (G110)</b> TBD TBD, To Be Decided <span id='bitlink-1578'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1578)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1578' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1578)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>To Be Decided</b><br />TBD TBD<br />Thursday, March 2 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-380.html'>High-Fidelity and Data-Driven Methods for Multiscale and Multi-Physics Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75834' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

In this work, we propose a data-driven approach that guarantees finding stabilizing controllers from as few data samples as the dimension of the unstable dynamics, which typically is orders of magnitude lower than the state dimension of the system. The key is learning stabilizing controllers directly from data without learning models of the systems, which would require larger numbers of data points. Numerical experiments with chemical reactors and fluid dynamics behind obstacles demonstrate that the proposed approach stabilizes systems after observing fewer than five data samples even though the dimension of states is orders of magnitude higher.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75415' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk582' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(582)' class='star'><span class='star582'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (Forum Centre)</b> Henk van Waarde, Learning Stabilizing and Optimal Controllers from Data: An Informativity Approach <span id='bitlink-540'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(540)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-540' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(540)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Learning Stabilizing and Optimal Controllers from Data: An Informativity Approach</b><br />Henk van Waarde<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-128.html'>Goal-Oriented and Context-Aware Scientific Machine Learning - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>Learning accurate models of complex dynamical systems is a daunting task that requires large amounts of data. At the same time, robust control theory teaches us that near-perfect modelling is not required in all situations. Often, control policies can be obtained from data as long as the uncertainty is "not too large". Therefore, taking into account the eventual purpose of the data is of paramount importance when learning dynamics.     
In this talk, I will introduce the concept of data informativity for control. This concept captures the richness of data that is required for various data-based control problems. We will then discuss necessary and sufficient conditions under which a given dataset is informative for stabilization and for optimal control. These conditions also lead to new methods to design (optimal) controllers directly from given data via semidefinite programming.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75415' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk583' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(583)' class='star'><span class='star583'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (Forum Centre)</b> Alejandro N.

However, for so-called "extreme-scale" problems, the storage of such high-dimensional FOM simulation data renders ROM training infeasible. Domain-decomposition (DD) alleviates this issue by solving the FOM on smaller subdomains, thereby generating training data of more manageable sizes. Model reduction can then be applied to each subdomain, and the separate ROMs can be reassembled to compute a global ROM for the DD FOM. A promising model reduction approach for the DD problem is the so-called nonlinear-manifold ROM (NM-ROM). NM-ROM has provided improved accuracy over linear-subspace ROMs (LS-ROMs), particularly for advection-dominated problems. NM-ROM approximates the FOM state in a nonlinear-manifold, which is learned from training a shallow, sparse-masked autoencoder using the FOM simulation data. The shallow, sparse architecture of the autoencoder allows for hyper-reduction to be applied, yielding computational speedup. In this talk, the DD formulation of the FOM and the application of NM-ROM to each subdomain are discussed. The results of the DD NM-ROM approach with hyper-reduction are numerically compared to DD LS-ROM with hyper-reduction for the 2D steady-state Burgers' Equation.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75415' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk584' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(584)' class='star'><span class='star584'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (Forum Centre)</b> Dingcheng Luo, Derivative Informed Neural Operators for PDE-Constrained Optimization under Uncertainty <span id='bitlink-542'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(542)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-542' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(542)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Derivative Informed Neural Operators for PDE-Constrained Optimization under Uncertainty</b><br />Dingcheng Luo<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-128.html'>Goal-Oriented and Context-Aware Scientific Machine Learning - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>We present a novel framework for solving PDE-constrained optimization problems under uncertainty through the use of derivative informed neural operators. When optimizing the performance of systems governed by PDEs, uncertainty in the model parameters lead to  optimization under uncertainty (OUU) problems, where the optimization cost is defined in terms of risk measures of a quantity of interest. OUU problems are often orders of magnitude more expensive to solve compared to their deterministic counterparts due to the need to evaluate the risk measure by stochastic integration. This can require many evaluations of the governing PDE at every optimization iteration.    
To this end, we propose to use a reduced-basis network to approximate the PDE mapping from the input spaces of the uncertain parameter and the optimization variable to the output state, where derivative information of the PDE is used to determine the reduced-bases. We also incorporate the PDE derivatives into a Sobolev-type training loss to ensure that the neural operator has accurate derivatives with respect to the optimization variable, such that they are amenable to derivative based optimization algorithms when solving the OUU problem.  In this talk, we will discuss the construction of such neural operators and its use as surrogates for OUU. We also demonstrate its performance and computational speed-ups over a suite of numerical examples.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75415' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk585' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(585)' class='star'><span class='star585'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (Forum Centre)</b> Akila K., Intelligent Fire Evacuation Navigation Algorithm-Based on Internet of Things <span id='bitlink-543'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(543)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-543' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(543)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Intelligent Fire Evacuation Navigation Algorithm-Based on Internet of Things</b><br />Akila K.<br />Monday, February 27 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-128.html'>Goal-Oriented and Context-Aware Scientific Machine Learning - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>With the huge complex electrical systems in the hospitality sector, problems such as imbalanced electrical loads, overloaded circuits, faulty fuses, etc., are common and may cause fire and eventually risk human life especially in high-rise buildings. The interior environments in such infrastructure can be complicated and diverse, which makes it important to safeguard people in the event of a fire and get them to the nearest safe exit quickly. Hence, in this work, we propose a Q-learning based approach to find a deadline-aware adaptive emergency navigation strategy in buildings with WSNs, which informs each customer about a hazard-avoided evacuation path to successfully reach safe exit gates within the specified deadline under all circumstances. For this, the proposed approach analyzes the intensity of fire to predict the specific limited evacuation time and then, an online navigation strategy is proposed based on a real-time adaptive routing algorithm to maximize and ensure the user's safety. The proposed approach is evaluated by conducting extensive simulations and prototype experiments.

The discretization leads to a mildly nonsymmetric double saddle-point linear system. We identify numerical properties and exploit the sparsity structure of the matrix, for the purpose of developing a fast preconditioned iterative solution procedure. The proposed preconditioners are based on approximations of two Schur complements that arise in decompositional relations associated with the double saddle-point matrix and its blocks. We analyze the eigenvalue distribution of the preconditioned matrices with respect to the physical parameters of the problem and show that the eigenvalues are strongly clustered. Consequently, preconditioned GMRES appears to be relatively insensitive to the mesh size and the physical parameters involved.  Numerical results validate our theoretical observations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75645' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1301' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1301)' class='star'><span class='star1301'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (G110)</b> Gustavo Ramirez-Hidalgo, Parallel Efficiency of Coarsest Grid Solvers in Multigrid <span id='bitlink-1201'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1201)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1201' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1201)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Parallel Efficiency of Coarsest Grid Solvers in Multigrid</b><br />Gustavo Ramirez-Hidalgo<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-287.html'>Advances in Large-Scale Solvers in Computational Science and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Multigrid methods find their way into many applications in scientific computing. Simulations in theoretical studies of the inner workings of nuclei, in particular, are bound by the use of supercomputers to speed them up. Multigrid methods have brought a way of pushing the computational boundaries in such large-scale simulations, and they open the possibility of scalably simulating at the exascale.    
Unfortunately, under certain extreme situations such as the use of many processes and/or very high condition of the linear systems to be solved, the time spent at the coarsest grid ends up representing most of the execution time in those multigrid solves. If the solver employed at the coarsest level is e.g. GMRES, in which case we see the appearance of many dot products, scalability is at risk. We discuss here different ways in which we can improve the scalability of multigrid solvers by focusing on the coarsest level.    
All of our implementations and tests are performed within our solver library DD-alphaAMG, a solver for large and sparse matrices emerging in lattice quantum chromodynamics, but these techniques are useful in any application where multigrid fails to scale due to coarsest-level restrictions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75645' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1302' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1302)' class='star'><span class='star1302'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G110)</b> Jemima M.

Efficient implementation of these operators is therefore crucial for operational implementations.  Diffusion-based correlation operators are popular in ocean data assimilation, but can require a large number of serial matrix-vector product. A parallel-in-time formulation removes this requirement, and offers the opportunity to exploit modern computer architectures. High quality preconditioners for the parallel-in-time approach are well-known, but impossible to apply in practice for the high-dimensional problems that occur in oceanography. In this talk we consider a nested preconditioning approach which retains many of the beneficial properties of the ideal analytic preconditioner while remaining affordable in terms of memory and computational resource.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75645' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1303' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1303)' class='star'><span class='star1303'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G110)</b> John W.

These problems involve minimizing some function arising from a physical objective, while obeying a system of PDEs which describe the process. Of key interest is the numerical solution of the discretized linear systems arising from such problems, and in this talk we focus on preconditioned iterative methods for these systems.     
In particular, we describe recent advances in the preconditioning of multiple saddle-point systems, specifically positive definite preconditioners which can be applied within MINRES, which may find considerable utility for solving these optimization problems as well as other applications. In particular, these preconditioners lead to a guaranteed convergence rate for MINRES, and often demonstrate superior convergence as opposed to widely-used block diagonal preconditioners.     
Further, we briefly discuss an inexact active-set method for large-scale nonlinear PDE-constrained optimization problems, coupled with block diagonal and block triangular preconditioners for multiple saddle-point systems which utilize suitable approximations for the relevant Schur complements.     
This is joint work with Andreas Potschka (TU Clausthal).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75645' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1304' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1304)' class='star'><span class='star1304'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM (G110)</b> Massimiliano Fasi, Multiword Matrix Multiplication with Tensor Cores <span id='bitlink-1204'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1204)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1204' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1204)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multiword Matrix Multiplication with Tensor Cores</b><br />Massimiliano Fasi<br />Tuesday, February 28 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-287.html'>Advances in Large-Scale Solvers in Computational Science and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>In multiword arithmetic, a matrix is represented as the unevaluated sum of two    or more lower-precision matrices, and a matrix product is formed by    multiplying the constituents in low precision.    We investigate the use of multiword arithmetic for improving the    performance–accuracy tradeoff of matrix multiplication with mixed precision    block fused multiply–add (FMA) hardware, focusing especially on the tensor    cores available on NVIDIA GPUs.    Building on a general block FMA framework, we develop a comprehensive error    analysis of multiword matrix multiplication.    After confirming the theoretical error bounds experimentally by simulating low    precision in software, we use the cuBLAS and CUTLASS libraries to implement a    number of matrix multiplication algorithms using double-binary16    arithmetic.    When running the algorithms on NVIDIA V100 and A100 GPUs, we find that    double-binary16 is not as accurate as binary32 arithmetic despite    satisfying the same worst-case error bound.    Using probabilistic error analysis, we explain why this issue is likely to be caused by the    rounding mode used by the NVIDIA tensor cores, and propose a parameterized    blocked summation algorithm that alleviates the problem and significantly    improves the performance--accuracy tradeoff.

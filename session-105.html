It is known that the 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, Prx1 and Prx2, not only control cytoplasmic H2O2 concentrations but can also mediate H2O2 signalling. Recent experiments indicate that H2O2 signalling at the cytosol of human cells is spatially localised. In this talk we will present and discuss reaction-diffusion model of the cytosolic human peroxiredoxin (Prdx)-based system that accounts for the differential kinetic parameters. The results confirm that H2O2 signalling at the cytosol of human cells is spatially localised and that site-specific scaffold proteins allow H2O2 released to the cytosol at distinct sites to independently regulate distinct genes and processes.

They exhibit finite-size scaling and have dynamic critical exponent $z\approx 1$. Midge swarms have reproductive purposes, form near a marker placed on the floor, and comprise less than 900 flying male insects. An important model of flocking is Vicesk’s: $N$ particles under discrete time dynamics align their velocities to the average velocity of all particles within their sphere of influence plus an alignment noise. To avoid aligned particles escaping to infinity, particles are usually confined within a box with periodic boundary conditions. Instead, we subject the particles to a confining harmonic potential in infinite space. For this model, appropriate noise and confinement strength, we have discovered a novel phase transition. The confinement versus noise critical line separates disperse single-cluster from multicluster chaos (distinguished by topological data analysis), swarms are scale-free, have minimal correlation time, correlation length proportional to swarm size. The largest Lyapunov exponent vanishes with confinement. Susceptibility, correlation length, dynamic correlation function, largest Lyapunov exponent obey power laws. Their critical exponents agree fairly with observations of natural midge swarms. These results contrast with those obtained from the order-disorder transition of the Vicsek model confined in a finite box under periodic boundary conditions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75379' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk474' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(474)' class='star'><span class='star474'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G101)</b> Gloria Triguero, Active Vertex Model and Coarse Graining of Collective Cell Migration in a Monolayer <span id='bitlink-438'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(438)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-438' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(438)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Active Vertex Model and Coarse Graining of Collective Cell Migration in a Monolayer</b><br />Gloria Triguero<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-105.html'>Shape and Size in Medicine, Biotechnology and Materials Science - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Due to its importance in wound healing, cancer progression and embryonic development, collective cell migration in a cellular monolayer has been extensively studied by mathematical and physical modeling, computation and experimentation. Confluent motion of epithelial cells can be described using simpler active vertex models, in which cells are polygons forming a Voronoi tessellation of the tissue. The dual Delaunay triangulation comprises cells centers that evolve according to dynamics including collective inertia and active forces. To model motion on supracellular length scales, we should develop continuum theories informed by models describing cell motion. Here we describe coarse graining strategies of the active vertex model that produce continuum equations for density, mean velocity, pressure and nematic order parameter and include active forces. We extract coarsened quantities directly from simulations of the active vertex model and compare with results from the continuum examples equations in simple cases of wound healing assays and formation of fingers.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75379' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk475' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(475)' class='star'><span class='star475'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G101)</b> Abhishek Chakraborty, Modelling the Coupling of Calcium Signalling and Mechanics in Embryogenesis <span id='bitlink-439'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(439)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-439' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(439)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Modelling the Coupling of Calcium Signalling and Mechanics in Embryogenesis</b><br />Abhishek Chakraborty<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-105.html'>Shape and Size in Medicine, Biotechnology and Materials Science - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Calcium (Ca2+) signalling is one of the most important mechanisms of information propagation in the body. The coupling between Ca2+ signalling and mechanics plays a crucial role in fertilisation, embryogenesis, wound healing, and cancer. One of the most important stages of embryogenesis is neural tube closure (NTC), which is responsible for the formation of the neural tube, the structure that later develops into the central nervous system. NTC is driven, in part, by the complex interplay of Ca2+ signalling and mechanics through Apical Constriction (AC) and malformations like anencephaly and Spina Bifida can result when this coupling is disrupted. However, this mechanochemical coupling is poorly understood and few models are available. We have developed a novel cell-based mechanochemical model that integrates Ca2+ signalling into the vertex modelling framework. Using the vertex-based model (developed in Python), we investigate how the spatial and temporal patterning of Ca2+ can trigger changes in cell shape by regulating their mechanical properties, resulting in tissue deformation, and how this deformation in turn impacts the Ca2+ patterning.  Crucially, the model reproduces key aspects of the NTC process – asynchronous, cell-autonomous Ca2+ flashes precede pulsed contractions at the cell level and a monotonic reduction of the tissue area.

This work utilizes uniform features extraction from both topological data analysis and electrostatics from charged protein-ligand complexes. Our methods overcome the difficulties of involving electrostatics, which is expensive to compute due to its long range and pairwise natures. The simulation results show accurate prediction of binding affinity and meanwhile demonstrate the significance of involving electrostatics in the machine learning framework.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75379' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

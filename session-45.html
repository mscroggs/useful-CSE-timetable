Earlier works have explored to model the unknown ODE system with a Neural Network or with a Gaussian Process model. However, NN are prone to overfit, while GPs are limited to a low dimensional data setting. To extend GPs to high-dimensional data setting we propose a novel framework by combining a generative and a Bayesian nonparametric model, called VAE-GP-ODE. Our model learns a physically meaningful latent representation (position, momentum) and solves in the latent space an ODE system. The use of GP allows us to account for uncertainty as well as to extend our work with informative priors forming a constraint on the model. Moreover, we extend our work by proposing an disentanglement between the dynamic states and the time-invariant variables, enabling robust latent ODE models that can generalize across different settings. We demonstrate our framework on video sequences and low-dimensional oscillating systems. Our VAE-GP-ODE with informative prior obtains state-of-the-art performance compared to earlier GP-based ODEs models for dynamic forecasting, while our disentanglement framework results in improved long-term predictions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75265' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk206' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(206)' class='star'><span class='star206'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (E108)</b> Silvia Sciutto, Continuous Generative Neural Network for Inverse Problems <span id='bitlink-191'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(191)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-191' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(191)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Continuous Generative Neural Network for Inverse Problems</b><br />Silvia Sciutto<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-45.html'>Operator Learning in the Physical and Data Sciences - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>We study Continuous Generative Neural Networks (CGNNs), namely, generative models in the continuous setting. The architecture is inspired by DCGAN, with one fully connected layer, several convolutional layers and nonlinear activation functions. In the continuous $L^2$ setting, the dimensions of the spaces of each layer are replaced by the scales of a multiresolution analysis of a compactly supported wavelet. We present conditions on the convolutional filters and on the nonlinearity that guarantee that a CGNN is injective. This theory finds applications to inverse problems, and allows for deriving Lipschitz stability estimates for (possibly nonlinear) infinite-dimensional inverse problems with unknowns belonging to the manifold generated by a CGNN.

For the purpose of performing diagnostics, we require disease indicators (biomarkers) that are strongly correlated with the underlying condition, i.e. absolute vascular pressure for hypertension. Measuring absolute pressure requires an invasive procedure and it is impossible for pregnant subjects, but an informed estimate is possible via the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics. Unfortunately, not only the computational cost of CFD is high, but also patient specific information required in modeling is missing in the clinic.    
The goal of this talk is to synthesize AI, CFD and medical imaging (US/MRI) techniques to provide trustworthy predictions of strong  biomarkers for early diagnosis of HPD in a real-time clinical setting. We will present a three-step procedure based on a reduced order Navier-Stokes and an ensemble of Operator Learning models with a nonlinear manifold decoder and show how it can employed to provide accurate biomarker predictions for different topologies together with a quantification of the associated uncertainty.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75265' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk208' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(208)' class='star'><span class='star208'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM (E108)</b> Jason Torchinsky, Multi-Model Communication and Data Assimilation for Improving Model Dynamics <span id='bitlink-193'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(193)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-193' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(193)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multi-Model Communication and Data Assimilation for Improving Model Dynamics</b><br />Jason Torchinsky<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-45.html'>Operator Learning in the Physical and Data Sciences - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Developing a single model to capture all the dynamics of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere is an immense task. Each model will have a deficiency in at least a small number of areas, such as the Madden--Julian Oscillation or the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Improving these aspects of atmosphere models often comes at the cost of introducing or worsening deficiencies in other areas. In contrast, it is possible to create specialized, low-dimensional models to capture these phenomena by simplifying many aspects of the full system. Here, we propose a strategy to allow different models communicate throughout a simulation. The communication lets us leverage the strengths of each model without needing to change their dynamics. The strategy is based on common data assimilation techniques used to combine models and real-world data. We implement this strategy in a test case consisting of a deficient tropical atmosphere model and a model of the Madden--Julian Oscillation. The models have different state spaces and different dynamics. We show that our strategy enriches the dynamics of both models beyond the information that is communicated between them.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75265' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk209' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(209)' class='star'><span class='star209'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM (E108)</b> Zheyi Yang, Morphological Parameters Estimation of Neurons Using a Machine Learning Algorithm on Diffusion MRI Data <span id='bitlink-194'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(194)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-194' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(194)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Morphological Parameters Estimation of Neurons Using a Machine Learning Algorithm on Diffusion MRI Data</b><br />Zheyi Yang<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-45.html'>Operator Learning in the Physical and Data Sciences - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is a promising non-invasive modality that can be used to probe tissue microstructure. Existing methods that estimate brain microstructure parameters often use biophysical models that are a) based on analytical expressions of the diffusion MRI signal, b) arising from simplified geometrical models of neuronal tissue. We take a different approach by a) numerically solving a gold standard model for the diffusion MRI signals, given by the Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation that governs the transverse magnetization, b) while using realistic neuron geometries.    
In previous work, we created accurate finite element meshes for over 1000 realistic neurons whose surface descriptions have been uploaded to the database NeuroMorpho.Org, and solved the Bloch-Torrey equation to obtain the simulated diffusion MRI signals of these neurons in 64 diffusion directions and at 31 diffusion-encoding gradient strengths. In this work, this set of simulated data was used to train a support vector machine to estimate morphological parameters such as soma volume, dendrite volume, and dendrite total length.    
The results reveal that the direction-averaged dMRI signals are significantly related to certain morphological parameters, such as soma volume, soma volume fraction, etc. This study is part of the effort to show that machine learning algorithms can serve as an efficient estimator for certain neuroanatomical parameters in diffusion MRI experiments.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75265' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

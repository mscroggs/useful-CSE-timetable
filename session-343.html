In the case of electrostatics, they give rise to a system of partial differential equations where the Poisson and Poisson-Boltzmann equations are coupled on a molecular surface, which interfaces the solute and solvent regions. A boundary-integral approach is a natural choice to simulate such system, as the interface and Dirac delta-like charge distributions are accurately represented. There are a number of Poisson-Boltzmann solvers available that are widely used, however, they fall short in terms of usability in a larger computational workflow, and extensibility to incorporate modifications to the model. In this talk, we will introduce the Poisson-Boltzmann & Jupyter (PB&J) code, a boundary integral solver based on Bempp-cl, designed to be easy to use and extend without sacrificing accuracy or speed. We will review the main design principles and present application examples showing its efficiency in terms of user and computer time. Moreover, this Python-based approach is aligned with current developments in computational chemistry and biophysics, making it possible to integrate into existing computational workflows for multiscale modeling or analysis software, straight from a Jupyter notebook.

In this talk, we present two methods that make use of  the symbolic form of the potential and the symbolic form of the PDE given by the  user to synthesize efficient FMM code.    
First we describe a method that automatically synthesizes low complexity   translation operators for arbitrary potentials satisfying an elliptic PDE using a compression scheme. These operators have the same complexity as the state of the art spherical/plane wave based translation operators. We observe the asymptotic time complexities for these operators and also give an upper bound on the error in the compression scheme.    
Next we outline a method that automatically synthesizes execution plans for an integral equation representation involving multiple input Green's function and multiple outputs. We introduce tools to reduce the number of FMM calls needed by doing algebraic manipulations on the symbolic integral equation representation.    
Finally, we describe applications where our methods are able to synthesize  efficient execution plans and generate efficient code for each FMM in the  execution plan.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75755' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1559' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1559)' class='star'><span class='star1559'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (D407)</b> Han D.

However, the integral equations on which the standard BEM is based contain strongly-singular and hyper-singular kernels. Consequently, special theoretical and numerical treatment is required in implementing the method. In this talk, I will present a systematic procedure to develop a set of regularized boundary integral equations for modeling cracks in 2D linear multi-field media. The class of media treated is quite general and includes, in special cases, anisotropic elasticity, piezo-electricity, and magneto-electro-elasticity. The development of a pair of weakly-singular weak-form integral equations for ‘generalized displacement’ and ‘generalized traction’ is of particular interest. These equations are the basis of a weakly-singular Symmetric Galerkin BEM. The developed weak-form boundary integral equations are completely regularized in that all kernels that appear are (at most) weakly singular of order ln(r), where r is the distance between the source and field points. This feature allows standard Co elements to be utilized everywhere except at crack tips. I also present the development of a special crack-tip element that incorporates extra degrees of freedom at the tip node so that the ‘generalized stress intensity factors’ are obtained directly from the solution to the system of discretized equations. To verify the accuracy and versatility of the method, we examined various numerical examples in both infinite and finite domains. It is seen that highly accurate results for the relevant fracture data (i.e., the ‘generalized stress intensity factors’) can be obtained using relatively coarse meshes.

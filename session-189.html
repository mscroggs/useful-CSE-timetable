<h2>Numerical Methods for Particle Suspensions and Fluid-Structure Interactions at Small Scales - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk863' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(863)' class='star'><span class='star863'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (D304)</b> Anna Broms, Closely Interacting Rigid Particles in Stokes Flow with Contact Handling and Local Corrections <span id='bitlink-796'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(796)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-796' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(796)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Closely Interacting Rigid Particles in Stokes Flow with Contact Handling and Local Corrections</b><br />Anna Broms<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-189.html'>Numerical Methods for Particle Suspensions and Fluid-Structure Interactions at Small Scales - Part II of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>The multiblob method is an inexpensive and approximate technique for simulations of particles in Stokes flow. We improve on its accuracy for rigid axisymmetric particles in 3D free space by reducing two different error contributions: self-interaction and pair-interaction errors, dominant in the far-field and near-field respectively. The later reduction is done by local pair-corrections as inspired by Stokesian dynamics. As we study the particles dynamically, more challenges are introduced -- despite the more accurate description -- something that holds true for any choice of Stokes solver. Rigid particles in a Stokesian fluid can physically not overlap, as a thin layer of fluid always separates a particle pair, exerting increasingly strong repulsive forces on the bodies for decreasing separations. Numerically, resolving these lubrication forces comes at an intractably large cost and particle collisions and overlaps do occur. In this talk, non-overlap constraints, in terms of the Euclidean distance between boundary points on the particles, are represented via a barrier energy. We solve for the minimum magnitudes of repelling contact forces between any particle pair in contact to correct for overlaps, by enforcing the barrier energy to be zero at the next time step. The method is tested on suspensions of spheres, rods and boomerang shaped particles where collision free configurations can be obtained at all  instances in time.

The linear analysis of the coarse-grained model shows an instability for a range of parameters, which we summarize in a phase diagram. Lastly, we show large-scale simulations of torque-dipolar micro-swimmers and illustrate the collective behavior in the regions of parameter space indicated by the stability analysis.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75492' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk865' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(865)' class='star'><span class='star865'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (D304)</b> Ursy Makanga, Sedimentation of Flexible Fibers in Structured Environments <span id='bitlink-798'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(798)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-798' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(798)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Sedimentation of Flexible Fibers in Structured Environments</b><br />Ursy Makanga<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-189.html'>Numerical Methods for Particle Suspensions and Fluid-Structure Interactions at Small Scales - Part II of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>The motion of flexible fibers often happens in complex media that are structured by obstacles. Examples range from the transport of biofilm streamers through porous media to the design of sorting devices for DNA molecules. For large number of such problems, the dynamics of the fibers result from the complex interplay between internal elastic stresses, contact forces and hydrodynamic interactions with the walls and obstacles. By means of numerical simulations, experiments and analytical predictions, we investigate the dynamics of flexible fibers settling in a viscous fluid embedded with obstacles of arbitrary shapes. We show that, for a single fiber, the fiber's deformation, orientation, velocity and trajectory are strongly altered by its properties and the presence of the obstacle. We introduce a numerical model to capture the aforementioned changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We identify and characterize two types of events : trapping and gliding, the former involves nontrivial trapping conformations on sharp obstacles, and the latter, a lateral dispersion. We show how these effects can be leveraged to propose a new strategy to sort fibers based on their size and/or elasticity.

We present a method based on a lattice-Boltzmann fluid coupled to point particles that interact with each other via the Discrete Element Method. Two-way coupling between the solid and fluid phases is used. The effect of (locally) large solid volume fractions on the fluid is  accounted for by using a lattice-Boltzmann formulation based on the generalized Navier-Stokes equations.    
  We discuss how intricacies of the coupling scheme must be considered to avoid unphysical behavior and instabilities which were reported in previous studies. Through this analysis, we identify under what conditions the model can be expected to yield accurate results. The method is validated by comparison to experiments and established numerical studies. Our method is built upon the LBM solver Musubi and scales well on the Dutch supercomputer Snellius. It is especially suitable for simulating flows containing many small particles in complex geometries.    
To demonstrate this, we apply our method to study the distribution of particles injected from a catheter into an arterial geometry. Various catheter positions are evaluated, showing how the model could be used to optimize treatment in targeted drug delivery applications. In future work we will apply our model to realistic anatomic geometries to study the injection of radioactive particles in radioembolization, a treatment for liver cancer.

Apart from challenging the system's serviceability and integrity, these events pose a limit to the versatility and applicability of structural health monitoring strategies. The present works addresses the challenges associated with the response prediction and parameter identification of systems subjected to such events in the context of vibration-based structural health monitoring. The proposed approach relies on projection-based Reduced Order Models for the representation of system dynamics, which are tailored to an inverse framework that aims to estimate characteristic traits of the system's state and features of the induced damage.  To assess the damage evolution and capture the changes in system parameters over time, the ROMs are used as predictors in the context of a sequential Bayesian inference problem, whereby the physics is fused with vibration response measurements. This approach allows recursive state or damage-related parameter estimation through a bank of filters and an evolution strategy that captures the parametrized states' dynamics. By continuously monitoring damage-related features and tracking the system's traits, the proposed framework aims to provide an indirect evaluation of the system's condition, while quantifying the induced damage.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75560' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1080' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1080)' class='star'><span class='star1080'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (G109)</b> Joar Ax&#229;s, Fast Data-Driven Model Reduction for Non-Linearizable Dynamics <span id='bitlink-996'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(996)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-996' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(996)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fast Data-Driven Model Reduction for Non-Linearizable Dynamics</b><br />Joar Ax&#229;s<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-237.html'>Recent Advances in Nonlinear Model Reduction for Computational Mechanics - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>An area of intense study in nonlinear dynamics is automated model identification of nonlinear systems based entirely on data. An ideal model is simple enough for system interpretability and control, but rich enough to capture essential nonlinearities. Efficient reduction of very high-dimensional datasets is another challenge.    
In our approach, we use spectral submanifolds (SSMs) as reduced spaces. Specifically, an SSM is the unique smoothest nonlinear continuation of a spectral subspace from a steady state. After identification of the SSM, we compute its dynamics in the Poincar√© normal form.     
The recently presented SSMLearn algorithm identifies SSMs from data via nonlinear optimization. While broadly applicable, this method is too computationally costly to handle higher-dimensional data. Here, we introduce a simplified method, fastSSM. Our main assumption is to estimate the tangent space of the SSM via singular value decomposition. Furthermore, the normal form dynamics are computed analytically rather than via implicit optimization.    
This entails a speedup of several orders of magnitude, allowing analysis of higher-dimensional datasets. We demonstrate this by training on a full surface profile signal from tank sloshing experiments. Furthermore, we show that our algorithms can capture the loss of stability and transition between buckling states with data from a FE beam simulation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75560' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1081' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1081)' class='star'><span class='star1081'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (G109)</b> Clayton Little, Projection-Based Reduction of Adaptively-Refined Nonlinear Models <span id='bitlink-997'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(997)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-997' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(997)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Projection-Based Reduction of Adaptively-Refined Nonlinear Models</b><br />Clayton Little<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-237.html'>Recent Advances in Nonlinear Model Reduction for Computational Mechanics - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is often required and fairly practiced in the context of high-dimensional, mesh-based numerical simulations. However, it is in its infancy in that of low-dimensional, generalized-coordinate-based simulations such as those performed using projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs). This talk presents a complete framework for executing PROMs in the presence of AMR that builds on elements of readily available methods while contributing several critical new ones. In particular, it introduces an efficient algorithm for computing a pseudo-meshless inner product between AMR snapshots for the purpose of projection and clustering. The proposed framework allows for hyperreduction, which is often necessary for parametric and/or nonlinear problems: for this purpose, it incorporates the energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) method. It relies on the concept of local reduced-order bases to achieve computational tractability in the presence of AMR. All new ideas described in the talk are illustrated with the solution of three-dimensional, nonlinear, convection-dominated turbulent flow problems. Their impact is highlighted by the significant speedups that they deliver for realistic problems.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75560' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

The preconditioner is constructed by a decomposition of the nonlinear residual space into two subspaces; one corresponds to the low frequency subspace and the other corresponds to the high frequency subspace. Such a decomposition is obtained by an unsupervised learning algorithm. The new method features a low computational cost and is capable of balancing the overall nonlinearity effectively.

This coupled relation can be investigated by numerical multiscale simulations of the total organ, liver lobules and liver cells. To enable robust, efficient, and patient-specific diagnosis and prediction of hepatic diseases through simulations, the purely knowledge-based models are complemented by data-based approaches.  To better understand the relation between hepatic perfusion, metabolism and tissue, we have developed a multicomponent, poroelastic multiphase and multiscale function-perfusion model, using a mixture theory based on the Theory of Porous Media.   To increase the robustness of the model and allow for near real-time patient-specific simulations, computationally critical parts are enhanced by data-driven methods through the integration of experimental, clinical and in silico data from cooperation partners. In addition to purely data-driven methods, we will increase the model robustness and the overall accuracy of the model predictions by exploring hybrid knowledge- and data-driven approaches. The overarching goal is the definition and development of an accurate decision-supporting framework for clinical applications.

Next to hypertrophy, skin contraction is a common long-term side effect. If contraction has reached the extent that patients suffer from joint immobility, then the contraction is referred to as a contracture. In order to devise therapies that prevent the formation of contractures, it is important to be acquainted with the underlying biological mechanisms. Since clinical observations are represented in terms of patterns and numbers, mathematical quantification in order to validate biological theory is indispensable. Since the model formulations consist of a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, the finite element strategies result in expensive simulations. In particular, the assessment of uncertainty quantification used to estimate the probability distribution of medical scenarios makes the computations very expensive. In order to have feasible access to the simulations in clinical settings, the simulations are accelerated using artificial intelligence by means of feed-forward neural networks. During the presentation, the mathematical model and the applied artificial intelligence model will be introduced.

One sub-field in particular, deep learning, emerges from the rest. Deep-learning algorithms are more complex and abstract than traditional machine learning algorithms, which allows them to automate some pieces of the training process and eliminate some of the human intervention.  A mesmerizing recent application of deep-learning is the physics-informed neural network, a mesh-free method that can be easily implemented using automatic differentiation from popular deep-learning frameworks. This application is nothing else but a neural network mapping multiple independent variables to a physics field and whose predictions conform to the physics laws described by differential equations. This is achieved by guiding its training with a loss function that includes the equations residuals and the constraint of initial and boundary conditions.  Although previous studies solved a wide variety of differential equations, most applications are still limited to simple one- or two-dimensional domains. However, real-life engineering problems involve more complex geometries. This work demonstrates the application of physical-informed neural networks to such geometries. The demonstration cases solve the steady-state heat conduction equation with both Dirichlet and Neumann conditions in two-dimensional geometries with non-orthogonal boundaries to the Cartesian coordinates.

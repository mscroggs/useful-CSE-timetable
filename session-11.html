As for the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, the drift-kinetic or gyrokinetic models which are generally used in magnetic fusion can be derived from an action principle or a non canonical hamiltonian formulation.  We will show in this talk how geometric Particle-In-Cell methods that have been recently derived for the Vlasov-Maxwell equations can be extended to the more complex drift-kinetic and gyrokinetic models.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75198' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk48' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(48)' class='star'><span class='star48'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (D301)</b> Yekaterina Epshteyn, Structure-Preserving Numerical Algorithms for Hyperbolic and Related Models with Uncertainty <span id='bitlink-48'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(48)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-48' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(48)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structure-Preserving Numerical Algorithms for Hyperbolic and Related Models with Uncertainty</b><br />Yekaterina Epshteyn<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-11.html'>Computational Methods for Kinetic Models - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we will discuss design of structure-preserving numerical methods for hyperbolic and related models with uncertainty. As a primary example, shallow water systems with uncertainty will be considered, but the developed ideas can be extended to a wider class of models, including different models of conservation/balance laws. Shallow water equations are widely used in many scientific and engineering applications related to modeling of water flows in rivers, lakes and coastal areas.   We will show that the developed structure-preserving numerical methods deliver high-resolution and satisfy necessary stability conditions. We will illustrate the performance of the designed algorithms on a number of challenging numerical tests. Current and future research will be discussed as well.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75198' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk49' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(49)' class='star'><span class='star49'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (D301)</b> James A.

Efficient numerical methods for Boltzmann-BGK should be asymptotic-preserving, which allows the numerical method to be stable at fixed mesh parameters for any value of the Knudsen number, including in the fluid (very small Knudsen numbers), slip flow (small Knudsen numbers), transition (moderate Knudsen numbers), and free molecular flow (large Knudsen numbers) regimes. In this work we develop a novel approach for solving the Boltzmann-BGK equation for achieving both arbitrary high-order and the asymptotic-preserving property. The proposed method is a locally-implicit discontinuous Galerkin (LIDG) scheme with careful modification in both the prediction and correction steps to achieve the asymptotic-preserving property. Some key advantages of the proposed schemes are: (1) no splitting between macroscale and microscale components of the distribution function is required; (2) only a single unified time-discretization is required; and (3) arbitrary high-order in both space and time can be achieved simply by increasing the spatial polynomial order in each element. Several numerical examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical scheme.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75198' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk50' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(50)' class='star'><span class='star50'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (D301)</b> William A.

We propose a formulation in terms of potentials, in which the first-order Maxwell system is cast as a collection of second-order wave equations with the aid of the Lorenz gauge condition. Then, the usual Lorentz force for the particles is expressed in terms of these wave potentials and their spatial derivatives through the use of generalized momentum. A new BDF wave solver is presented for the solution of these equations for the potentials that induces a discrete equivalence between the Lorenz gauge condition and the continuity equation. We also discuss the new methods used to construct the spatial derivatives required in the update for particles, which are inspired by the wave solver used to evolve the potentials. Numerical results will be presented to demonstrate the application of the new method. If time permits, some of our on-going work in extending these methods to high-order accuracy will be discussed.

Due to the complexity of the structure, conventional numerical methods, such as the finite difference and finite element methods, are not very efficient. Often, a photonic device consists of several simpler parts for which the dielectric function depends only on one spatial variable. The mode matching method and its many numerical variants have been widely used to analyze photonic devices with simple one-dimensional parts. Since the dielectric function is typically piecewise constant, numerical mode matching methods based on piecewise polynomials, such as the polynomial expansion mode matching method (PEMM) and the pseudo-spectral mode matching method (PSMM), are particularly efficient. However, the condition numbers associated with PEMM and PSMM are often very large, leading to limited accuracy and difficulty in convergence when iterative methods are used. In this paper, we develop a well-conditioned numerical mode matching method based on a spectral Galerkin scheme. We show that this method produces numerical modes with good orthogonality and significantly reduces the condition numbers of the final linear systems.

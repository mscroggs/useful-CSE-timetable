We start with digitized images of realistic media digitized into voxels. The challenges include the coupled nature of the governing PDEs of different types as well as the fact that the geometry may be changing, but it is not feasible to obtain the geometry snapshots in time. The goals are to eventually upscale the solutions.  By design, we employ therefore the lowest order mixed finite element methods on rectangular grids, and we embed the domains in realistically  simple fictitious domain. This strategy makes tracking the behavior of the entire system feasible while the pre-processing and post-processing efforts are manageable and allow to focus on the deliverables of interest.  This strategy is motivated by applications in human tissue, soil-vegetation systems, and multiphase flow coupled to energy conservation in porous media.

Our work involves a new mixed finite element formulation for the phase change problem; this model works very well with the appropriate heterogeneous non-linearities, both at the microscopic scale as well as at the Darcy scale. We demonstrate robustness of our algorithm for thermo-hydro properties when handling irregular data such as the temperature-enthalpy relationship calibrated using data from Alaska. For the hydro-mechanical portion of the model, we consider the three-field formulation of Biot's system of poroelasticity, which we demonstrate is robust in physical scenarios involving heterogeneity and non-linear elastic and hydrological constitutive relationships and parameters. We further discuss our progress towards the coupled TpHM system, particularly the challenges of a monolithic scheme and our progress on sequential coupling.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75278' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk237' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(237)' class='star'><span class='star237'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D402)</b> Svetlana Tokareva, Numerical Modeling of Permafrost Thermal Dynamics in Arctic Lake-Soil Systems <span id='bitlink-220'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(220)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-220' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(220)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Numerical Modeling of Permafrost Thermal Dynamics in Arctic Lake-Soil Systems</b><br />Svetlana Tokareva<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-52.html'>Computational Modeling of Coupled Multiscale Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Permafrost degradation is observed to increase rapidly in Arctic coastal regions due to permafrost warming. Increases in air temperature is the primary direct driver of permafrost warming, but frequent coastal flooding has been recognized as another important driver indirectly contributing to permafrost warming. However, the impact of coastal flooding on permafrost has not been tested and remains poorly understood. Our goals are to 1) understand permafrost hydro-thermal dynamics under floods and 2) develop new capability to simulate arctic lake and permafrost thermal dynamics.    
We consider a coupled one-dimensional model of snow-lake-soil system with variable water body depth. The temperature distribution in the lake (with or without ice) is calculated by means of a heat diffusion equation in the scaled coordinate system to account for variability in the depth. The soil is a coupled model of heat equation for the temperature and Richards equation for the water content. Finally, we use the surface energy balance equation to model the snow layer.    
The numerical discretization and coupling of the physical processes are performed using the Amanzi-ATS software infrastructure. For model verification we compare the results of Amanzi-ATS simulations for three different lakes in Alaska with the seasonal observation data for the surface temperature and the depth of the snow and ice layers.

In order to quantify the rupture-risk as well as to assess different treatment strategies in-silico, detailed numerical simulations of the hemodynamics within the aneurysm as well as the interaction with treatment devices such as coils are necessary. In this talk, we present research and simulation results based on the Lattice-Boltzmann method to simulate the bloodflow within real, 3D and patient specific vessel-geometries obtained from medical scans. Realistic coil geometries are obtained via a one-dimensional spring-wire insertion simulation that takes into account bending, wall-contact, self-intersection as well as a manufacturer-predefined coil micro-structure that allows to fill the aneurysms space to a large extend, eventually occluding it from further bloodflow.   In order to lower computational costs, we also aim to replace and compare such, computationally costly, fully resolved coiling-bloodflow-simulations by means of porous medium surrogate models, where parameters such as porosity and permeability are obtained via homogenization from different, realistic coils as mentioned before.  It is our goal to eventually provide a simulation tool that will allow medical doctors to judge and select – based on quantities of interest such as the wall-shear-stress on the aneurysm walls – different treatment methods and devices in advance, based on the specific patients data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75278' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

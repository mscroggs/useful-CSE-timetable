However, the presence of dense fibrous regions, lack of proper substrate, and cell overcrowding may hamper cells from moving in certain directions or even from sensing beyond regions that practically act like physical barriers. I will first describe a non-local kinetic model in which the sensing radius  is not constant, but depends on position, sensing direction and time as the behaviour of the cell might be determined on the basis of information collected before reaching physically limiting configurations. I will then describe a continuum model to deal with the transmigration through basal membranes.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75298' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk272' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(272)' class='star'><span class='star272'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D507)</b> Christina Kuttler, Bacterial Communication in Space - An Interplay of Nonlinear Dynamics and Spatial Inhomogeneity <span id='bitlink-253'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(253)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-253' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(253)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Bacterial Communication in Space - An Interplay of Nonlinear Dynamics and Spatial Inhomogeneity</b><br />Christina Kuttler<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-60.html'>Exploring Complexity in Life Sciences with Modeling and Simulations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Many bacterial species use the so-called Quorum sensing, a communication system, to coordinate their behaviour,   e.g. for pathogeneity or other substantial changes of their life-style. Gene regulation systems are the basis for   such systems. They often contain positive and negative feedback loops. This may allow under certain conditions for  bistability.   As the communication involves the diffusion or transport of molecules, we find more interesting phenomena due to the  combination of diffusion and non-linear reactions. We aim in understanding this from both, the mathematical and the   biological perspective, including a short view on treatments like classical antibiotics but also Quorum quenching -  a kind of inhibition of Quorum sensing.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75298' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk273' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(273)' class='star'><span class='star273'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D507)</b> Carles Falco, Quantifying the Shape and Growth of Colliding Tissues via Continuum Models and Bayesian Inference <span id='bitlink-254'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(254)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-254' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(254)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quantifying the Shape and Growth of Colliding Tissues via Continuum Models and Bayesian Inference</b><br />Carles Falco<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-60.html'>Exploring Complexity in Life Sciences with Modeling and Simulations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Although tissues are usually studied in isolation, this situation rarely occurs in biology, as cells, tissues, and organs, coexist and interact across scales to determine both shape and function. Here, we take a quantitative approach combining data from recent experiments, mathematical modelling, and Bayesian parameter inference, to describe the self-assembly of multiple epithelial sheets by growth and collision. We use two simple and well-studied continuum models, where cells move either randomly or following population pressure gradients. After suitable calibration, both models can reproduce the main features of single tissue expansions. However, our findings reveal that whenever tissues are not isolated from others, and hence interactions become relevant, the random motion assumption can lead to unrealistic behaviour. Under this setting, a model accounting for population pressure from different cell populations is more appropriate and can help to compare with experimental measures. Finally, we discuss how tissue shape and pressure affect multi-tissue complex collisions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75298' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk274' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(274)' class='star'><span class='star274'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D507)</b> Giovanni Samaey, Multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling Methods for Bayesian Inverse Problems in Cardiac Electrophysiology <span id='bitlink-255'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(255)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-255' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(255)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling Methods for Bayesian Inverse Problems in Cardiac Electrophysiology</b><br />Giovanni Samaey<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-60.html'>Exploring Complexity in Life Sciences with Modeling and Simulations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>In modeling of cardiac arrhythmias, an important problem is to use medical data tune the model parameters to represent an individual patient. Since the amount of measurement data is limited, not only a optimal parameter fit is needed, but also an estimate on the uncertainty of this optimal fit.  In this talk, we study the use of  multlilevel Monte Carlo methods to sample the posterior parameter distribution of a Mitchell-Schaeffer model for cardiac arrhythmia.  To validate the computational procedure, we will work synthetic data, simulated via the same model,   to which we will add measurement noise with different sizes and covariance structures. The goal is to  recover the (spatially homogeneous) model parameters that were used to generate the data, and to assess the importance of the size and the correct quantification of measurement noise. To measure  similarity between measurement data and model output, we use the LAT as a summary statistic, effectively resorting to an Approximate Bayesian Computation. Since PDE models for biological systems typically contain lots of modeling error, we also study the effect of model error on the posterior distribution.

They are very powerful special type of systems as they automatically steer a given dynamical system to the extremum (minimum/maximum) of an objective function that we do not have its mathematical closed form a priori. In fact, ESC systems only require access to measurements of said unknown objective function. We hypothesize that ESC systems are able to capture, describe and replicate many biological optimization phenomena. Unlike many dynamic optimization methods and optimal control solvers used in modeling/studying biological optimization phenomena, ESC systems are real-time, stable and operable through access to measurements (sensing); this matches the nature of biological optimization phenomena. As a proof of concept, we provide an example of work we done on capturing and mimicking soaring birds optimized flight maneuvers. Our results show the effectiveness of ESC systems as a mean to study real time dynamic optimization phenomena in biology.        	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75298' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

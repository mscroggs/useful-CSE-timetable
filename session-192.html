<h2>Stochastic and Multiscale Modeling Approaches for Interfacial Systems - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk877' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(877)' class='star'><span class='star877'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Matteo Maestri, Structure-Dependent Multiscale Analysis in Heterogeneous Catalysis <span id='bitlink-807'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(807)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-807' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(807)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structure-Dependent Multiscale Analysis in Heterogeneous Catalysis</b><br />Matteo Maestri<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-192.html'>Stochastic and Multiscale Modeling Approaches for Interfacial Systems - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Multiscale analyses based on structure-dependent microkinetic modeling are acknowledged to be an essential key tool to achieve a detailed mechanistic understanding of the catalyst functionality as they bridge the micro-scale environment of the active site and the macroscale reaction environment. Here, we present a methodology to perform a structure-dependent microkinetic analysis of a catalytic process. The methodology makes it possible to unveil the nature and identity of the active site in a self-consistent manner. The methodology is based on the combination of microkinetic modeling and ab initio thermodynamics with Wulff constructions and Boltzmann statistics at given conditions of chemical potential in the reactor. In doing so, the structure and the coordination geometry of each atom at the catalyst surface are determined. Then, microkinetic analyses are performed on the distribution of the sites in order to unravel the identity of the active site during the reaction. Selected examples in the context of water-gas-shift, reverse-water-gas shift, and CO2 methanation on metal catalysts will be employed as showcases. As a whole, this methodology makes it possible a concomitant description of the nature of the catalyst material in reaction conditions and of its catalytic consequences in terms of reactivity. As such, it paves the way towards the use of first-principles methods for the interpretation of the experimental evidence in terms of structure-activity relationships.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75498' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk878' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(878)' class='star'><span class='star878'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Stefan Ringe, First-Principles Multi-Scale Modeling of Electrochemical CO$_2$ Reduction <span id='bitlink-808'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(808)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-808' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(808)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>First-Principles Multi-Scale Modeling of Electrochemical CO$_2$ Reduction</b><br />Stefan Ringe<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-192.html'>Stochastic and Multiscale Modeling Approaches for Interfacial Systems - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Electrochemical CO$_2$ reduction is at the heart of the world's effort towards a sustainable energy future. Despite this, devices have not yet been optimized to the performance level needed to overthrow conventional chemical processes. Here, we propose a new multi-scale model for electrochemical CO$_2$ reduction which is based on first-principles quantum chemical calculations. We connected a kinetic model built up from Density Functional Theory calculations with a mass transport model accurately depicting the design of a state-of-the-art electrolyzer. From that, we analyze local concentration variations with macroscopic design parameters, but also possible liquid intermediates and mechanistic effects. We conclude by giving general design principles to the hands of experimentalists to derive optimized electrolyzer cells.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75498' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk879' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(879)' class='star'><span class='star879'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Alexey N.

The model accounts for various modes of non-equilibrium, which are characteristic for plasma plumes induced by short- and ultra-short pulses. It includes a two-temperature model of the irradiated target, a kinetic model for flow of atoms and ions, and a continuum model for electrons in gaseous plasma. The model of plasma plume is implemented as a part of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The classical DSMC method is combined with the collision-radiation (CR) model using an approach, when a simulate particle represents both ions and atoms in multiple excited states. In the CR model, non-equilibrium distribution of ions, elastic collisions between electrons and ions, multiphoton ionization, inverse Bremsstrahlung, electron impact ionization, three-body recombination, as well as plasma emission are accounted for. The developed model is used to study the efficiency of burst laser ablation under conditions of strong plume accumulation effect and plasma shielding.

Since both simulation methods incorporate thermal fluctuations, a correct coupling of the two methods through a computational interface requires careful stochastic analysis. In addition, the fact that the two methods are based on disparate types of descriptions (that is,  FHD is a continuum description whereas KMC is particle dynamics on a lattice) makes it a nontrivial task to develop a thermodynamically-consistent coupling between the two phases. By assuming that additional interactions between the two phases that are induced by the inclusion of surface chemistry occur only through adsorption and desorption processes, we develop a physically-inspired flux-exchange model where mass and energy fluxes across the interface are computed based on adsorption/desorption counts. By performing stochastic analysis, we justify the proposed mass and energy updates in FHD cells. We validate the overall hybrid simulation method by performing simulations for gas-solid interfaces undergoing reversible adsorption. We also discuss high-performance computing implementation strategies.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75498' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

The use of deep learning based surrogate models can accelerate the design phase with close to real-time simulations. In this talk we will focus on deep learning surrogate models for its use in the design of offshore wind turbine support structures with perforations. Here, the development of surrogate model faces three main challenges: first, we have incompressible turbulent flows with transient inflow conditions; second, the geometries resulting from arbitrary number/shape of perforations are complex and mesh generation might be time-consuming; and third, we need surrogate models that are able to deal with non-parametric geometries, e.g. geometries that cannot be parametrized by the same parametric variables used in the training phase. Here we propose surrogate models based on Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for flow over objects with arbitrary geometry together with the use of unfitted Finite Element method, the Shifted Boundary Method, that addresses the three challenges.

The framework is composed of an encoder that compresses high-dimensional measurements into low-dimensional state variables, and a latent dynamical model for the state variables that predicts the system evolution over time. The training of the proposed model is carried out in an unsupervised manner, i.e., not relying on labeled data.  Our learning method is evaluated on the motion of a pendulum -- a well studied baseline for nonlinear model identification and control with continuous states and control inputs -- measured via high-dimensional noisy RGB images. Results show that the method can effectively denoise measurements, learn compact state representations and latent dynamical models, as well as identify and quantify modeling uncertainties.

With these computational speed-ups, real-time solutions to problems where conventional methods often struggle, such as data assimilation, is now possible.    
In this talk, we will present how a neural network-based forward solver is embedded into a Bayesian data assimilation framework. Specifically, we will show how a particle filter approach can be sped-up by several orders magnitude without sacrificing accuracy by using neural network surrogates.    
The general idea is to reduce the dimension of the high-fidelity state using an autoencoder and then perform time-stepping in the low-dimensional latent space using a transformer neural network. The data assimilation then takes place in the latent space instead of the high-fidelity space. To do so efficiently, it is helpful to incorporate certain properties into the latent space, such as distributional and smoothness to enable sampling.    
The result of the data assimilation is a latent space posterior distribution that characterizes the assimilated latent state. This information is then transformed back to the high-fidelity state to get the final estimates and uncertainties.    
The methodology is showcased on a leak detection problem in pipelines. This problem is modeled by a set of nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs with a discontinuous source term, which makes it difficult to solve for conventional methods in a satisfying timeframe.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75595' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1181' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1181)' class='star'><span class='star1181'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G101)</b> Federico Pichi, A Convolutional Graph Neural Network Approach to Model Order Reduction for Nonlinear Parametrized PDEs <span id='bitlink-1092'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1092)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1092' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1092)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Convolutional Graph Neural Network Approach to Model Order Reduction for Nonlinear Parametrized PDEs</b><br />Federico Pichi<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-259.html'>Reduced Order Modeling of Differential Equations Through Deep Learning Algorithms - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>The development of efficient reduced order models (ROMs) from a deep learning perspective enables users to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches. Convolutional autoencoder structures gained popularity in the ROM community as an extension to linear compression procedures [K. Lee and K. Carlberg. Model reduction of dynamical systems on nonlinear manifolds using deep convolutional autoencoders. JCP, 2020] and [S. Fresca, L. Dede, and A. Manzoni. A comprehensive deep learning-based approach to reduced order modeling of nonlinear time-dependent parametrized PDEs. JSC, 2021].   One drawback of these approaches is the lack of geometrical information when dealing with complex domains defined on unstructured meshes.  The present work proposes a framework for nonlinear model order reduction based on Graph Convolutional Autoencoders (GCA) to exploit emergent patterns in different physical problems, including those that show a bifurcating behavior [F. Pichi, B. Moya, and J. S. Hesthaven. “A convolutional graph neural network approach to model order reduction for non-linear parametrized PDEs”. In preparation, 2022].  The proposed structure exploits the autoencoder paradigm to extract the evolution of the latent space while handling consistently the underlying geometrical domain and alleviating the learning process through pooling and unpooling operations. We present the capability of this novel architecture w.r.t. classical benchmarks and bifurcating phenomena.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75595' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

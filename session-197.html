<h2>Focal Points of Software for European Exascale Architectures</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk899' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(899)' class='star'><span class='star899'>&star;</span></a> <b>1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM (D506)</b> Estela Suarez, Exascale - Introduction and Principal Challenges <span id='bitlink-827'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(827)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-827' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(827)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Exascale - Introduction and Principal Challenges</b><br />Estela Suarez<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-197.html'>Focal Points of Software for European Exascale Architectures</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>The enormous computational performance of Exascale machines offers new opportunities for industrial and scientific users, but also presents them with difficult challenges. Many of these challenges stem from the heterogeneity of the hardware. On the processing side, the main source of computer performance is accelerators (e.g., general-purpose graphics cards) that are combined with CPUs (which in turn already contain a variety of arithmetic/logic units and vector processing engines). On the memory side, not only are cache hierarchies deepening, but the diversity of technologies and devices in the overall memory and storage subsystems is growing: from fast SRAM to tape, almost every type of memory and storage technology in existence is in use.  HPC users should be aware of the heterogeneity of modern system architectures, but should not be left alone in the face of it. Ideally, most of the hardware complexity should be handled by the middleware and software stack, while interfaces to applications become hardware agnostic and standardised. This approach facilitates the long-term sustainability of applications, as well as their portability across platforms. However, today we are far from this situation. To improve it, the SEA projects are developing a software stack with the functionality and tools needed to cope with heterogeneous resources and share them more dynamically between users.

The RED-SEA R&D project will leverage the BXI technology from ATOS, defined as the key production-proven European Interconnect, which features smart Network Interface Cards (NICs) capable of achieving high bandwidth communications. Other KPI (Key Performance Indicators) such as scalability, reliability or congestion management are also central to cope with issues raised in an Exascale environment. Future environments are likely to feature multiple NICs thus increasing substantially bandwidth capabilities that are yet to be taken advantage of for BXI networks.    
To abstract these network complexities to the developer, MPI  (Message Passing Interface) has become the de facto standard in the scientific community. In this presentation, we propose to introduce our implementation of the multi-rail feature in the MPC SW framework, embedding CEA's implementation of the MPI standard. In particular, we will explain the software architecture and design choices that were made to efficiently support the protocols needed to communicate on multiple network cards while taking advantage of the hardware capabilities of the BXI NICs. Performance results on BXI networks with multiple NICs will be shown demonstrating the benefits of multiplexing communications for very large message sizes.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75503' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk901' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(901)' class='star'><span class='star901'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (D506)</b> Philippe Deniel, Deep Dive - Exascale I/O and Storage Systems <span id='bitlink-829'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(829)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-829' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(829)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Dive - Exascale I/O and Storage Systems</b><br />Philippe Deniel<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-197.html'>Focal Points of Software for European Exascale Architectures</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>The future arrival of Exaflop supercomputers raises several major challenges for the HPC storage systems. Besides the scale of such systems (hundreds of thousands of nodes), the volume of data created by applications running on them, and the need for highest energy efficiency, root causes include new hardware and new paradigms involved in supercomputers, evolution of software methods, use cases that were previously impossible to handle and only now become feasible.    
This talk will identify these new constraints and challenges and propose tracks and solution in order to address them and build future, highly efficient Exascale storage systems. In particular, solutions involving non-Posix interfaces like Object Stores, I/O resource scheduling and storage hierarchies will be analysed and investigated.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75503' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk902' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(902)' class='star'><span class='star902'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (D506)</b> Paul Carpenter, Deep Dive - Exascale System Software and Programming Models <span id='bitlink-830'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(830)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-830' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(830)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Dive - Exascale System Software and Programming Models</b><br />Paul Carpenter<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-197.html'>Focal Points of Software for European Exascale Architectures</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>HPC applications are rising in complexity, to address problems such as climate, medicine, and digital twins, and to combine numerical simulation with HPDA and AI. Increased system performance and energy efficiency leads to complex system architectures, with accelerators, multiple kinds of memory device, and processing in memory and/or storage. These developments put a high demand on the system software and programming environment. This talk will discuss the approaches of three related research projects in Europe: DEEP-SEA, IO-SEA and RED-SEA. The projects address Software for Exascale Architectures, driven by application use cases, from the perspectives of heterogeneity and the modular supercomputer architecture, I/O and storage, and the interconnect.    
This talk will outline the main software research directions. Performance portability and productivity are key challenges, requiring compiler and runtime intelligence, and a separation of the source code from its optimizations. Heterogeneous memory systems are targeted through APIs and automated data placement. All layers, including resource management middleware, are being updated to support malleability, i.e. to allow jobs to dynamically adjust their resource usage. Data management and hierarchical storage are being updated to span NVMe and NVRAM down to the least active data on tape. This talk with highlight these and other research directions, the results achieved so far and the impact on the future of European HPC.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75503' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

It is of paramount importance in healthy processes such as organ growth and repair and wound healing, and also in pathologies such as cancer or retinopathies. It is triggered by the emission of vessel growth substances from a region of tissue lacking oxygen. On mesoscopic scales large compared to cell size but small compared to organ size, it can be modeled using stochastic differential equations and birth/death processes for branching of blood vessels and for their merging (anastomosis). From the stochastic process, we have derived a transport equation for the density of active tips of blood vessels, which is parabolic and contains source terms for branching and anastomosis that include a memory term. It is coupled to a reaction-diffusion equation for the growth factor concentration. Numerical simulation of the transport equation and the underlying stochastic process show that the density evolves towards a moving soliton-like wave whose velocity and shape change slowly according to some ordinary differential equations for collective coordinates. We have also developed a theory of fluctuations about the density by adding multiplicative noises to the transport equation. The moments of the density turn out to be given by powers of the soliton solution with appropriate exponents.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75502' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk895' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(895)' class='star'><span class='star895'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (G107)</b> Ana Carpio, A Transport Model for Cell Motion <span id='bitlink-823'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(823)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-823' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(823)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Transport Model for Cell Motion</b><br />Ana Carpio<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-196.html'>Mathematical Problems and Simulations in the Applications of Transport Theory - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Two phase flow models have been shown to be useful to understand cell motility. Simple 1D, two-phase, poroviscous, reactive flow model capture behaviors relevant to cell crawling. These models assume constant cell  length. We release that assumption and study the behavior of the  resulting transport equations. We devise adequate numerical schemes  and simulate travelling solutions capturing new features of cell motion.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75502' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk896' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(896)' class='star'><span class='star896'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (G107)</b> Orazio Muscato, Electrothermal Monte Carlo Simulation of a Resonant Tunneling Diode <span id='bitlink-824'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(824)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-824' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(824)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Electrothermal Monte Carlo Simulation of a Resonant Tunneling Diode</b><br />Orazio Muscato<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-196.html'>Mathematical Problems and Simulations in the Applications of Transport Theory - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Monte Carlo technique for the solution of the Wigner transport equation has been developed, based on the generation and annihilation of signed particles. A stochastic algorithm without time discretization error has been recently introduced (Muscato et al. Kin.Relat. Models, 12(1), 59-77, 2019), based on the theory of piecewise deterministic Markov processes. Numerical experiments have been performed in the case of a GaAs Resonant Tunneling Diode (RTD), improving the CPU consumption   (Muscato, J. Comput. Electron., vol 20., pagg. 2062-2069, 2021). In such nano-devices the presence of very high and rapidly varying electric fields is the cause of thermal heating of the carriers and the crystal lattice. In fact, the external electric field transfers energy to the electrons and in turn to the lattice through the scattering mechanism. This self-heating process can influence significantly the electrical behaviour because the dissipated electrical energy causes a temperature rise in the device resulting in increased power dissipation. The mechanism through which lattice self-heating occurs is that of electron scattering with phonons, and therefore a model which deliberately incorporates all scattering events will also capture such energy dissipation details.

RO at high salinities and high pressures is challenging due to membrane compaction that changes its porosity and permeability. In this study, we present a simulation methodology for membrane structural mechanics to understand pore size distribution and permeability variations under high pressure. We use the material point method (MPM), that solves the solid mechanics equations in a Lagrangian framework. MPM provides many features that make it well-suited for simulating mesoporous membranes. The Lagrangian framework allows for large deformations, easy integration of constitutive models and direct import of complex geometries as particles. The spatial discretization in our MPM solver is achieved using linear or cubic-spline shape functions while the time integration is carried out using the explicit Euler method. A series of images containing detailed pore structures obtained from X-ray tomography is first converted to a collection of material points. Compressive loads are applied to the top layer of the membrane to simulate the application of pressure. The membrane deformation and pore size distribution before and after load application are reported and compared with the experimental measurements. The presentation discusses the numerical methods used, the performance of the solver on high-performance computing machines, and the results of membrane compact in detail.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75502' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

In order to solve the problem numerically, the differential equation is transformed into a coupled system of singularly perturbed differential equations associated with appropriate boundary conditions. The original domain is divided into three subdomains that overlap: two layer subdomains and one regular subdomain. On each subdomain we consider backward Euler scheme on a uniform mesh in time and the standard central difference scheme on a uniform mesh in space. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is almost second order uniformly convergent. The numerical results also provide to assure the efficiency of the proposed numerical method.

These equations require closure relations for to balance the number of unknowns with the number of equations. Such closure may be attained by the Chapman-Enskog method which assumes that the distribution takes the form of a perturbation series in powers of the Knudsen number scaled by a Maxwellian. By using a scaled Boltzmann equation to solve for successive orders of the perturbation series, we obtain familiar fluid dynamic equations: Euler, Navier-Stokes-Fourier, Burnett, and so on.    
Whilst considering the linearized Boltzmann equation, we propose a different ansatz. Instead of a perturbation series, we use the variational multiscale (VMS) method to split our unknown into a coarse scale term from the space of collision invariants and a fine scale term from the orthogonal complement to the collision invariants.     We show that the Chapman-Enskog method can be viewed as particular way of approximating the fine scale term under the VMS formulation. By approximating the fine scale term differently, we are able to derive an alternative to the Burnett equations (i.e. a correction that is a step above Navier-Stokes-Fourier) for which we can show entropy stability. To show some benchmark results, these alternative equations necessitate extra boundary conditions which we motivate by considering the space-velocity weak form of the linearized Boltzmann.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75577' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(130)' class='star'><span class='star130'>&star;</span></a> Sameh Abdulah  <span id='bitlink-1904'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1904)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1904' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1904)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tile-Centric Approximations of The Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Large-Scale Spatial Statistics Modeling</b><br />Sameh Abdulah<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-29.html'>Structured Low-Rank Matrices - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is one of the most popular approaches to model spatial and spatio-temporal data in Geoscience. It relies on generating an $npt \times npt$ covariance matrix to describe the underlying geospatial random field, where $n$ represents the number of spatial locations, $p$ is the number of variables, and $t$ is the number of time slots. When the $npt$ value is large, the MLE calculation becomes prohibitive with $O((npt)^3)$ time complexity. In the literature, studies have adopted two ways to mitigate the computational cost of the MLE operation: high-performance computing and algebraic approximations. In this work, we couple parallel processing with matrix approximation techniques to speed up the MLE operation on large-scale systems. Moreover, we combine two approximation techniques, i.e., mixed precisions and low-rank matrix approximations, to deliver higher compression rate and faster time-to-solution, while maintaining applications' accuracy. The results show that our approximation technique can provide accurate estimates for the statistical parameters with a considerable performance improvement. Our experiments were conducted on three different systems, KAUST Shaheen-II (an Intel Haswell system), HLRS HAWK (an AMD Epyc Rome system), and Riken Fugaku (a Fujitsu A64FX system).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75245' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(453)' class='star'><span class='star453'>&star;</span></a> Nazanin Abedini  <span id='bitlink-1905'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1905)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1905' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1905)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Convergence Properties for Data Assimilation Based on Gauss-Newton Iteration</b><br />Nazanin Abedini<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-100.html'>Advances at the Intersection of Data Assimilation and Inverse Problems</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Data assimilation is the problem of finding a state of a dynamical system such that the difference between true state and an approximated one is small in a properly defined sense. The widely-used data-assimilation methods are variational methods. They aim at finding an optimal initial condition of the dynamical model such that the distance to the observations is minimized. The problem is formulated as a minimization of a nonlinear least-square problem with respect to initial condition, and it is usually solved using a Gauss-Newton method. Motivated by the variational approach, we consider a data-assimilation method that minimizes a cost function under assumption of model error. We are seeking a solution over a time window at once. We prove the method converges to the true state in the case of noise-free observations  and provide error bound in the case of noisy observations. Furthermore, we extend the method to parameter estimation. We confirm our theoretical results with numerical experiments using the Lorenz models.

If this strategy is very successful, this paper intends to go beyong, by following ideas arising from the Virtual Finite Elements methods (VEM) introduced by Bezzi and his collaborators a few years ago. Here also, even for polygonal meshes, the solution is thought as globaly continuous. No explicit representation of the solution is introduced, only its polynomials approximation on the polygonal elements that compose the mesh, and some moments of the solution. We will describe several methods to achieve this goal, for the compressible Euler equations.    
Our method has several common points with the Active Flux method developped recently by Roe et al. It has also several differences, in particular a wider flexibility in the choices of variables, as well as the shape of the elements.

Then, we implement constrained optimization schemes which decrease the cost starting from the selected initial guess and subject to wave equation constraints. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the method.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75380' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(444)' class='star'><span class='star444'>&star;</span></a> Michael S.

When these quantities are not available, data driven approaches can be used that require access only to input-output data.  Frequency-based data-driven methods have been very successful in creating high fidelity ROMs from data, but require access to values (and sometimes derivatives) of the transfer function.  These quantities can at times be costly or difficult to obtain, but one may have ample access to time-domain input-output data. In 2020, Burohman et al. introduced a framework to directly calculate transfer function values and derivatives using only time-domain data.  We first discuss improvements to this method that allow for a more efficient and robust numerical implementation, which lead to a theoretical result on optimal diagonal scaling of a class of matrices.  We then use these improvements to develop an algorithm that extends H2-optimal approximation to purely time-domain data.  We also compare the H2-optimal algorithm's performance to other well established frequency based ROM techniques (such as Loewner framework and Vector Fitting) using only time-domain data.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75369' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(767)' class='star'><span class='star767'>&star;</span></a> Mario Acosta  <span id='bitlink-1909'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1909)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1909' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1909)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Overview of Earth Science Challenges in the Exascale Era</b><br />Mario Acosta<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-168.html'>Advances in High Performance Computing for Earth Science - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>The increase in Earth System Models (ESMs) capabilities is strongly linked to the amount of computing power and data storage capacity available. Exascale ESMs are expected to open up a new range of opportunities, from increasing model resolution and larger ensemble simulations to the integration of new components to increase the accuracy of our predictions. To make this possible, exascale supercomputers will rely on accelerators and specialised hardware. While diversity for hardware gives more flexibility for co-design, it will increase the complexity of our ESMs.     
The exascale challenges are: leveraging accelerators, coupling models, ensuring accuracy and stability, dealing with increased I/O, enabling big-data workflows, etc. Solutions to these challenges must also guarantee future-proofing codes, pursue performance-portability across pre and exascale architectures, domain-specific languages and code sustainability. Most applications will require some degree of rewriting to expose more parallelism, and many face severe strong-scaling challenges if they are to effectively progress to exascale. Additionally, ESMs are expected to be performant in terms of both computational and energy efficiency.     
This talk will include a exascale overview for Earth modeling, covering main challenges to achieve the exascalw goal for our ESMs and the range of solutions adopted by the community to be ready for the new era.

The metriplectic formalism used to develop these methods is introduced. We briefly discuss several methods developed for this code: a mixed Poisson solver for a $C^0$ electric field; strictly conservative mapping between particle and finite element bases; monotonic entropy time integrators for collisions; and new particle based Landau collision operators.    
A mature, high-order accurate, finite element based Landau collision operator with adaptive mesh refinement, that has been optimized for accelerator architectures using the portable Kokkos programming language, is presented with results using the NVIDIA A100 and AMD MI250X architectures. We present verification studies using plasma resistivity and compare with Spitzer resistivity. New batch GPU linear solvers have been developed for this work. This work is integrated into the PETSc &#8220;solver" framework to provide a fully GPU implicit time advance of the Landau collision operator. We show that collision time advance with many species is practical for 3X + 2V models of tokamaks on today’s large-scale computers in cylindrical coordinates and that fully 3V models should be feasible in the near future.

However, it could be argued that the co-variance eigenvectors of the thermo-chemical state space used for PCA may be unable to fully capture information about important, extreme-valued localized chemical dynamics like ignition-kernel-formation. In such situations, a useful approach may be to consider a dimensionality reduction procedure where the required principal vectors are computed from high-order joint statistical moments and may enable improved identification of the state space directions corresponding to stiff dynamics. This talk presents one such procedure, namely the co-kurtosis PCA (CoK-PCA), that is based on the fourth-order joint statistical moment i.e. the co-kurtosis tensor. Apriori analysis of combustion datasets corresponding to spontaneous ignition of premixed ethylene-air in a simple homogeneous reactor and ethanol-fueled homogeneous charged compression ignition (HCCI) engine demonstrates that the co-kurtosis based reduced manifold is able to represents the original thermo-chemical state in the regions where chemical reactions are important with significant accuracy.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75785' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2051)' class='star'><span class='star2051'>&star;</span></a> Babak Maboudi Afkham  <span id='bitlink-1913'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1913)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1913' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1913)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Inferring Functions with Uncertain Regularity</b><br />Babak Maboudi Afkham<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-245.html'>Recent Advances in Inverse Problems for Computational Imaging - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>This work describes a Bayesian framework for reconstructing functions with uncertain regularity, i.e. roughness vs. smoothness.

We characterize the regularity of a function with its fractional differentiability. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian method which estimates a function and its regularity, simultaneously.

Filtering the smaller scales allows for using coarse discretizations, however, this requires closure models to account for the effects of the unresolved on the resolved scales. The common approach is to filter the continuous equations, but this gives rise to several commutator errors due to nonlinear terms, non-uniform filters, or boundary conditions. We propose a new approach to filtering, where the equations are discretized  first and then filtered. For a non-uniform filter applied to the linear convection equation, we show that the discretely filtered convection operator can be inferred using three methods: intrusive (‘explicit reconstruction’) or non-intrusive operator inference, either via ‘derivative fitting’ or ‘trajectory fitting’ (embedded learning). We show that explicit reconstruction and derivative fitting identify a similar operator and produce small errors, but that trajectory fitting requires signicant effort to train to achieve similar performance. However, the explicit reconstruction approach is more prone to instabilities.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75605' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(90)' class='star'><span class='star90'>&star;</span></a> Syver D&#248;ving Agdestein  <span id='bitlink-1915'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1915)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1915' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1915)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stable Discrete Closure Models Through Embedded Learning</b><br />Syver D&#248;ving Agdestein<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-19.html'>Data-Driven Predictive Modeling in Computational Science - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>For turbulent fluid flows, neural network closure models can learn to predict sub-grid scale stresses to high accuracy, while still producing instabilities once included in a solver [M. Kurz and A. Beck, Investigating model-data inconsistency in data-informed turbulence closure terms, 14th WCCM-ECCOMAS Congress, CIMNE, 2021]. By minimizing the a-posteriori error of the same models (embedded learning), stability can be enforced [Y. Guan et al., Stable a posteriori LES of 2D turbulence using convolutional neural networks, Journal of Computational Physics, 458:111090, 2022]. This requires a careful choice of hyper-parameters however, e.g. number of time steps unrolled [B. List et al., Learned turbulence modelling with differentiable fluid solvers, arxiv:2202.06988, 2022] and choice of initial parameters [S. D. Agdestein and B. Sanderse, Learning filtered discretization operators, arxiv:2208.09363, 2022]. Care must be taken to avoid local minima and exploding gradients.    
We investigate the accuracy and stability of closure models learned for PDEs subject to explicit discrete filters using embedded learning. The discrete setting allows for computing exact commutator errors and loss functions. We show that the learned closure models produce stable and accurate trajectories for the solution and energy in time upon extrapolation. We also compare the stability of the models trained while embedded in a solver to the one of those trained to predict the discrete commutator error only.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75223' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(349)' class='star'><span class='star349'>&star;</span></a> Fruzsina Agocs  <span id='bitlink-1916'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1916)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1916' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1916)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Fast and Arbitrarily High-Order Solver for Highly Oscillatory ODEs</b><br />Fruzsina Agocs<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-77.html'>Butterfly Factorizations: Algorithms, Applications, and Theory - Part I of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>Oscillatory systems are ubiquitous in physics: they arise in celestial and quantum mechanics, electrical circuits, molecular dynamics, and beyond. Yet even in the simplest case, when the frequency of oscillations changes slowly but is large, the vast majority of numerical methods struggle to solve such equations. Methods based on approximating the solution with polynomials are forced to take O(k) timesteps, where k is the characteristic frequency of oscillations. This scaling can generate unacceptable computational costs when the ODE in question needs to be solved billions of times, e.g. as the forward modelling step of Bayesian parameter estimation. In this talk I will introduce an efficient method for solving 2nd order, linear ODEs with highly oscillatory solutions. The solver employs two methods: in regions where the solution varies slowly, it uses a spectral method based on Chebyshev nodes and with an adaptive stepsize, but in the highly oscillatory phase it automatically switches over to an asymptotic method. The asymptotic method constructs a nonoscillatory phase function solution of the Riccati equation associated with the ODE. In the talk I will present how the method fits in the landscape of oscillatory solvers, the theoretical underpinnings of the asymptotic solver, a summary of the switching and stepsize-update algorithms, results from numerical experiments, and a brief error analysis.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75326' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1830)' class='star'><span class='star1830'>&star;</span></a> Eki Agouzal  <span id='bitlink-1917'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1917)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1917' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1917)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Projection-Based Model Order Reduction for Large-Scale Nonlinear Problems in Structural Mechanics Using An Industrial Code</b><br />Eki Agouzal<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-403.html'>Data-Driven Dynamics and Model Reduction for Nonlinear Systems in Engineering</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>We present our work on parametric model order reduction (pROM) for a generic class of parametric mechanical problems with internal variables in a nonlinear quasi-static framework.

As part of engineering design, engineers may perform repeated simulations for slightly differing configurations with different physical parameters or geometrical parameters (parametric study). Nevertheless, successive evaluations for nonlinear mechanical problems can entail prohibitive computational costs. We develop an adaptive algorithm based on a POD-Greedy strategy.  Since the operator is nonlinear, the computational complexity of the operator assembly scales with the size of the high-fidelity model. We develop an hyper-reduction strategy using an element-wise empirical quadrature in order to speed-up online assembly costs. We introduce a cost-efficient error indicator which relies on the reconstruction of the stress field by a Gappy-POD strategy, which can be used to drive the Greedy procedure. As an illustration and validation of our methodology, we provide namely numerical results on an elasto-plastic holed plate under traction, with physical variable parameters (strain hardening or elasticity coefficients).    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75883' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(685)' class='star'><span class='star685'>&star;</span></a> Mamoon Ahmed  <span id='bitlink-1918'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1918)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1918' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1918)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The C*-Dynamical System of Amenable Quasi-Lattice Ordered Groups and Positive Elements</b><br />Mamoon Ahmed<br />Monday, February 27 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-150.html'>Algorithms for Bifurcation Analysis of Partial Differential Equations</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>Let $(G,P)$ be a quasi-lattice ordered group.

In the Canadian GEM weather forecasting model, a system of nonlinear equations is linearized around a basic state and then reduced to an elliptic boundary value (EBV) problem. The large linear system arising from the discretization of the EBV problem is solved either by a parallel direct method or by a parallel iterative method based on a variant of Krylov subspace methods, namely the Flexible GMRES (FGMRES) algorithm. The operational GEM parallel solver account for a significant amount of the total model run-time, pointing to the need for a performance upgrade. Recently the efficiency and the parallel scalability of the GEM model iterative solver have been improved by the implementation of a suitable preconditioner, based on the Restricted Additive Schwarz, leading to the FGMRES convergence rate acceleration, therefore to a reduction in the number of iterations. Furthermore, the use of a newly reformulated Arnoldi-Gram-Schmidt algorithm (Swirydowicz et al., 2019) resulted in a small number of global reductions and synchronizations (communication) required by the inner products.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75384' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1813)' class='star'><span class='star1813'>&star;</span></a> Mark Ainthworth  <span id='bitlink-1920'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1920)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1920' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1920)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Systematic Approach to Constructing Preconditioners for the Hp-Version Mass Matrix on Unstructured and Hybrid Finite Element Meshes</b><br />Mark Ainthworth<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-399.html'>Exascale Software and Algorithms for High-Order PDE Solvers - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>We present a systematic approach to building uniform preconditioners for the mass matrix on unstructured meshes composed of higher dimensional elements using only preconditioners for lower dimensional simplices.

A two-phase mixture theory for the deflagration-to-detonation transition ({DDT}) in reactive granular materials.(1986)] by using a finite volume methods that decouples acoustic and transport phenomena. This approach is well-suited to many industrial applications like the simulation of flows in nuclear reactors when the material velocities are low compared to the sound velocities.    
For the Euler system, the classic Lagrange-Projection method allows to perform such decoupling by solving the flow equations in Lagrangian coordinates. Unfortunately, the Baer-Nunziato model involves three different material waves that do not allow to exhibit a simple expression of the system using Lagrangian coordinates.  Using similar ideas as in [Chalons, Kokh and Spillane. Large time-step numerical scheme for the seven-equation model of compressible two-phase flows.(2011)], we consider an operator splitting strategy that allows to separate an acoustic subsystem and a transport subsystem for the Baer-Nunziato model.    
This operator splitting allows to design a numerical scheme with a time-implicit treatment of the (fast) acoustic waves, in order to get rid of a too restrictive CFL condition, and an explicit treatment of the (slow) material waves in order to preserve accuracy, for the isentropic Baer-Nunziato model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75567' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1526)' class='star'><span class='star1526'>&star;</span></a> Scott Aiton  <span id='bitlink-1922'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1922)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1922' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1922)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Implementation of Coupled Simulations in the ForestClaw Library</b><br />Scott Aiton<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-336.html'>Adaptive Mesh Refinement: Algorithms and Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>We present an implementation of the coupling of two distinct adaptive simulations, run on a separate hierarchy of adaptive Cartesian meshes within the ForestClaw library.

We  considered a range of optimization problems: Steiner trees, travelling  salesperson problem, k-median and set cover. These problems are well  studied and a number of algorithms have been designed for these problems.  We look at the kind of quantities these algorithms employ and use these to  derive useful features for training a classifier that helps quickly reduce  the problem size by identifying the difficult core of the problem and  pruning the remainder. The difficult core is then solved using an Integer  Linear Programming (ILP) solver. A prime advantage of using such features  is that we do not require much data to train the classifier. This results  in algorithms returning a better trade-off between running time and  solution quality compared to commercial ILP solvers.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75715' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(376)' class='star'><span class='star376'>&star;</span></a> Assylan Akhanuly  <span id='bitlink-1924'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1924)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1924' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1924)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Modeling of Perovskite Solar Cells with Structured and Planar SnO2 Electron Transport Layers</b><br />Assylan Akhanuly<br />Tuesday, February 28 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-83.html'>Recent Advances in Numerical Methods for Electronic Structure Calculations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>Solar cell devices made using perovskites have reached the power conversion efficiency values (PCEs) as high as 25.7% for single-junction devices and 29.9% for silicon/perovskite tandem solar cell devices.

SDC can be understood as applying an appropriate preconditioner to a Picard iteration to obtain faster and more robust convergence. SDC has been studied primarily for first-order problems, using low-order methods as preconditioners (e.g., explicit, implicit, or implicit-explicit Euler). It has been shown that SDC can achieve arbitrarily high order of accuracy and possesses good stability properties.    
In this talk, we will present a theoretical analysis of the convergence and stability properties of SDC when applied to second-order ODEs and using velocity-Verlet as a preconditioner. While there are a few numerical studies of the performance of SDC applied to the second-order Lorentz equations (so-called “Boris-SDC”), there exists so far no theoretical analysis of the properties of SDC for general second-order problems.    
We will present a theorem that shows that the order of convergence depends on whether the force on the right-hand side of the system depends on the velocity (like in the Lorentz equation) or not (like in the undamped harmonic oscillator). We also show a theorem that guarantees convergence of SDC under certain conditions. We compare the stability domain of SDC with the Picard iteration and validate our theoretical analysis in numerical examples.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75653' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1958)' class='star'><span class='star1958'>&star;</span></a> Doruk Aksoy  <span id='bitlink-1926'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1926)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1926' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1926)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Incremental Tensor Train Decomposition for High-Dimensional Data Streams</b><br />Doruk Aksoy<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(262)' class='star'><span class='star262'>&star;</span></a> Hussam Al Daas  <span id='bitlink-1927'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1927)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1927' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1927)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Algebraic Multilevel Domain Decomposition Preconditioners</b><br />Hussam Al Daas<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-58.html'>Scalable and Efficient Linear Solvers for Large Real-World Applications</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>Multilevel Domain decomposition (MDD) methods are among the most efficient iterative methods for solving sparse linear systems.

I will present a framework that simplifies the analysis of the algebraic two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner. Based on this framework, I will present a series of robust and fully algebraic MDD methods, i.e., that can be constructed given only the coefficient matrix and guarantee a priori prescribed convergence rate. The series consists of preconditioners for least-squares problems, sparse SPD matrices, general sparse matrices, and certain saddle-point systems. Numerical experiments on challenging discretized PDEs and systems from the SuiteSparse Collection illustrate the effectiveness, wide applicability, scalability of the proposed preconditioners.

Thus, they are employed to accurately integrate stiff or oscillatory systems of ordinary differential equations or semidiscretizations of partial differential equations. However, the computational cost of implementing implicit RK methods often limits their applicability, especially when combined with large-scale and high-resolution numerical simulations. As an efficient alternative, diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) schemes are sought. We present an optimization approach for designing DIRK schemes of order six and higher that are A-stable and stiffly accurate. The accuracy and robustness of these schemes are shown via extensive numerical tests on diverse problems. This optimization approach can be adopted for designing numerical integrators with other desired properties.

In this work, we study the optimal control of AVs in mixed-autonomy traffic with the objective of smoothing unstable traffic flows. We first model the dynamics of a mixed-autonomy system where the acceleration of human-driven vehicles is governed by a car-following model, and the acceleration of AVs is to be controlled. This is realized as a system of first-order ODEs. We then formulate the optimal control problem and show the well-posedness of the system dynamics for a reasonable set of admissible controls and establish the existence of minimizers. Given this problem setup, we devise an approach for solving the optimal control problem based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle (PMP) and the adjoint method. Further, we propose to approximate the optimal controller using a set of parametrized basis functions. Their parameters are tuned by optimizing an objective function that involves the original objective of the optimal control problem over a distribution of trajectories. Through this approach, we aim to develop a feedback control scheme based on our open-loop optimal control problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches on real-world trajectories data collected from the I-24 in Tennessee, United States.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75519' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(469)' class='star'><span class='star469'>&star;</span></a> Christie Louis Alappat  <span id='bitlink-1932'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1932)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1932' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1932)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Accelerating Sparse Iterative Solvers and Preconditioners Using Race</b><br />Christie Louis Alappat<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-104.html'>Performance Engineering and Applications - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Sparse linear iterative solvers are indispensable for large-scale simulations. In this talk, we present methods to accelerate some of the existing solvers and preconditioners by using the concept of levels as developed in the context of our RACE library framework. Levels are constructed using breadth-first search on the graph related to the underlying sparse matrix. These levels are then used to implement cache blocking of the matrix elements for high spatial and temporal reuse. The approach finds its use in kernels like sparse-matrix-power vector multiplication, which perform back-to-back sparse-matrix vector multiplication (SpMV)-type iterations without global synchronizations in between. The method is highly effective and achieves performance levels of 50-100 GF/s on a single modern Intel or AMD multicore chip, providing speedups of typically 2x - 4x compared to a highly optimized classical SpMV implementation.    
After briefly introducing the optimization strategy, we shed light on the application of these optimized kernels in iterative solvers. To this end, we discuss the coupling of the RACE library with the Trilinos framework and address the application to communication-avoiding s-step Krylov solvers, polynomial preconditioners, and algebraic multigrid preconditioners. We then dive into the performance benefits and challenges of the RACE integration and show that our optimization produces numerically identical results and improves the total solver time by 1.3x - 2x.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75375' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1885)' class='star'><span class='star1885'>&star;</span></a> Fares Alazemi  <span id='bitlink-1933'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1933)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1933' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1933)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>PapStatistical Inference for Nonergodic Weighted Fractional Vasicek Models Er Here</b><br />Fares Alazemi<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(844)' class='star'><span class='star844'>&star;</span></a> Arnau Alb&#224;  <span id='bitlink-1934'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1934)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1934' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1934)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Lasso Monte Carlo, a Novel Method for High Dimensional Uncertainty Quantification</b><br />Arnau Alb&#224;<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-184.html'>Scientific Machine Learning to Enable Outer Loop Analysis - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>High-dimensional uncertainty quantification (UQ) is an active area of research, applicable to virtually all domains of science and engineering. In particular in the field of nuclear engineering, simulation codes use nuclear data libraries with tens of thousands of uncertain values, that need to be propagated to the output of the simulations. The most common methods used for UQ are Monte Carlo and surrogate-modelling. The former method is dimensionality independent but has a slow convergence, while the latter method has been shown to yield large computational speedups with respect to Monte Carlo. However, surrogate models are biased and suffer from the curse of dimensionality, becoming costly to train for high-dimensional problems. We present a new technique, Lasso Monte Carlo (LMC), which combines surrogate models and the multilevel Monte Carlo technique, to perform UQ in high-dimensional problems. We prove the unbiasedness of LMC, and that it can converge faster than simple Monte Carlo. The method is numerically tested on a variety of problems: high-dimensional linear functions, the Sobol function where LMC is compared to PCE, the FPUT lattice problem, and on a nuclear physics problem of calculations for spent nuclear fuel involving over ten thousand dimensions. The LMC method has faster convergence than simple Monte Carlo in all tests, and reduces the computational cost of UQ by up to a factor of 5.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75486' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(971)' class='star'><span class='star971'>&star;</span></a> John P.

Two approaches to explicitly track the motion of the domain's boundaries are presented, with different motivating applications and requirements.    
The first uses a reduced-order model to derive interface evolution equations from which the fluid flow is be subsequently reconstructed. This method will be applied to a three-layer fluid flow with the aim to study long-time interactions between free surfaces coupled by inertialess fluids. The equations are solved via a pseudo-spectral method implemented in a concise Matlab library. This approach allows us to study larger domains over an extended duration when compared to direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations, and we present nonlinear phenomena exhibited at these later times.    
The second approach uses finite-elements to solve the Navier-Stokes equations over a mesh which is allowed to deform elastically in response to changes in the free-surface such that the equations there are also satisfied. The higher-order model allows for more localised boundary conditions and we will focus on the point where the interface meets a solid wall. This approach is used to simulate a fluid being withdrawn from a cylinder, with gravity acting against the motion, where the transition from a steadily rising meniscus to more complex dynamics is of interests in industrial applications.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75525' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(93)' class='star'><span class='star93'>&star;</span></a> Alen Alexanderian  <span id='bitlink-1936'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1936)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1936' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1936)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Bayesian Approximation Error Approach for Design of Inverse Problems under Uncertainty</b><br />Alen Alexanderian<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-20.html'>Optimal Experimental Design and Robust Optimization for Large-Scale Inverse Problems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>We consider optimal experimental design for infinite-dimensional Bayesian  nonlinear inverse problems governed by PDEs.

Our approach builds on the Bayesian Approximation Error framework, which facilitates incorporating modeling uncertainties in the inverse problem.

Block-structured AMR specifically refines the mesh by defining locally structured regions with finer spatial, and possibly temporal, resolution. This combination of locally structured meshes within an irregular global hierarchy is in some sense the best of both worlds in that it enables regular local data access while enabling greater flexibility in the overall computation.    
Algorithms that evolve the solution on a hierarchical mesh are more complex than algorithms operating on a single uniform domain.  The nature of the complexity typically depends on the mathematical character of the governing equations and the additional physics being represented across levels.   In this talk I will give a very brief overview of the different types of block-structured AMR, different strategies for creating the mesh hierarchy, different approaches to time advancement, and some of the ways that algorithms must be adapted for use on an AMR hierarchy.

While various model- and learning-based approaches have been proposed to address these challenges, they broadly lack generalizability to different control tasks, rarely preserve the structure of the dynamics, and are unable to tractably bridge the gap between having accurate, but low-dimensional models. In this work, we propose a new, data-driven approach for extracting low-dimensional models from data using Spectral Submanifold Reduction (SSMR).  In contrast to other data-driven methods which fit dynamical models to training trajectories, we identify the dynamics on generic, low-dimensional attractors embedded in the full phase space of the robotic system. This allows us to obtain computationally-tractable models for control which preserve the system's dominant dynamics and better track trajectories radically different from the training data. We demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability of SSMR in dynamic trajectory tracking tasks vis-à-vis the state of the art, including Koopman operator-based approaches.

The EnKBF is a continuous-time  filtering methodology which can be viewed as a continuous-time analogue of the famous discrete-time ensemble Kalman filter. Our unbiased estimators will be motivated from  recent work which introduces randomization as a means to produce unbiased and finite variance estimators. Our estimator will be specific to linear and  Gaussian settings, where we know that the EnKBF is consistent, in the particle limit $N \rightarrow \infty$, with the KBF. We highlight this for two particular  variants of the EnKBF, i.e. the deterministic and vanilla variants, and demonstrate this on a linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We compare this with the EnKBF   and the multilevel (MLEnKBF), for experiments with varying dimension size.

A 2017 survey was used for the analysis, with the major events occurring between 2012 and 2017. Using R software, an analysis using logistic regression approaches was performed to assess the impact of socioeconomic and proximate factors on infant mortality.  The dependent variable of the study was whether the infant was alive or dead, while the independent variables were divided into socioeconomic and proximate factors.  According to the findings, some proximate factors have a significant connection with whether the infant is dead or living. The child's weight had a strong relationship with whether the child was alive or dead. The sex of the newborn was the final proximate factor that showed a significant connection with the child being dead or alive.  In the Ashanti Region, most of the neonatal deaths were due to low birth weight. Also, 62.7% of the babies that died were males.  The study revealed that if the significant elements under the proximate factors are considered, newborn mortality will be reduced.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75299' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(312)' class='star'><span class='star312'>&star;</span></a> Mercy G.

A very simple task performed by an individual such as raising an arm or lifting a leg can be accomplished with a wide range of muscle activation levels due to the concept of muscle redundancy. Some quantification is provided for the redundancy while presenting feasible solutions (muscle forces at joints). A sample of feasible solutions is generated for each time instance in the time interval for executing a specific locomotion of the body. This is done in the Bayesian framework, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. These solutions are in conformance with the uncontrolled manifold theory. Furthermore, inspired by the principles surrounding the Feynman-Kac formula, we propose an approach that smoothly connects the muscle activation pattern at each time instance to mimic the smoothness exhibited in normal human movement.

This limitation is overcome in numerous other approaches, of which we focus on the Shakhov and ellipsoidal statistics models. In this contribution, we address the implementation of these models in the spirit of the lattice Boltzmann approach, by discretizing the velocity space based on Gauss quadratures and replacing the equilibrium distribution by a truncated projection with respect to a set of orthogonal polynomials. We discuss an implicit-explicit implementation which allows the ideal hydrodynamics limit to be approached while keeping the time step finite.

RONS is a framework to build reduced-order models for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), where the reduced-order solution depends nonlinearly on time-varying parameters. With RONS we obtain an explicit set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to evolve the parameters. These ODEs minimize the instantaneous error between dynamics of the governing PDE and dynamics of the reduced-order solution. Additionally, conserved quantities of the PDE are easily enforced in the reduced solution using the RONS framework. For a reduced-order model with $n$ parameters, naive calculation of ODEs produced by RONS requires evaluating $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ integrals. By exploiting the structure of the RONS equations and using symbolic computation, we reduce the computational cost to $\mathcal{O}(K^2)$ where $K \ll n$. With this approach we apply RONS to problems which require many parameters in the reduced-solution, including simulation of vortex dynamics in turbulent fluid flow and the Fokker-Planck equation in high dimensions.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75419' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1275)' class='star'><span class='star1275'>&star;</span></a> Judith Angel  <span id='bitlink-1952'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1952)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1952' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1952)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Parallel-in-Time Solution of PDE-Constrained Optimization Problems with Hyperbolic PDEs</b><br />Judith Angel<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-280.html'>Advances in Time-Parallel Methods for Challenging Problems - Part II of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>Solving optimization problems with hyperbolic partial differential equations as constraints can be extremely challenging.

Beside the simple approach of applying Parareal to the forward as well as the adjoint problem, we will also explore approaches for a closer integration of Parareal into the optimization algorithm.

We consider configurations with a parallel or point source and a parallel, point, near-field or   far-field target. This gives eight systems, if we use reflectors only and take the minimum   number of freeform surfaces required.  Similarly, we get eight basic lens systems if we only use freeform lens surfaces.    
Our goal is to find the shape and location of the freeform surfaces that convert  a given source distribution into a desired target distribution.     
Many papers in freeform illumination optics cover only one particular optical system. Here we  derive models based on Hamilton's characteristic functions and  conservation of luminous flux for all sixteen systems.   Some configurations lead to standard or generalized Monge-Ampère equations.  The remaining systems are described by so-called generated Jacobian equations.    
Our numerical method for finding the optical surface(s) is an iterative least-squares solver.

More specifically, we propose new strategies to handle polytopal grid refinement, to be employed within an adaptive framework.  Specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks are employed to classify the “shape” of an element so as to apply “ad-hoc” refinement criteria or to enhance existing refinement strategies at a low online computational cost.  We test the proposed algorithms considering two families of finite element methods that support arbitrarily shaped polytopal elements, namely the Virtual Element method and the Polytopal Discontinuous Galerkin method. In the second part of the talk ML-aided grid agglomeration techniques are presented. Mesh agglomeration strategies are important both within adaptive refinement algorithms and to construct multilevel algebraic solvers. We propose to use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to automatically perform grid agglomeration. GNNs have the advantage to process naturally and simultaneously both the graph structure of mesh and the geometrical information. We assess the performance of the proposed agglomeration algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness when employed within multigrid solvers in a Polytopal Discontinuous Galerkin framework.

This "room" has become known as the unilluminable room and there are now numerous fascinating solutions to the problem.     
The original puzzle assumes that the light is described by rays (a so-called billiards problem) so that the light cannot “bend around corners”. Here we model light by solving the Helmholtz equation with a point source in one of the regions of the room and study (among other things) how dark the other region of the room actually is as we change the frequency of the light-source.             </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75521' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(898)' class='star'><span class='star898'>&star;</span></a> Sreejith Appukuttan  <span id='bitlink-1958'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1958)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1958' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1958)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Simulation of Reverse Osmosis Membrane Compaction Using Material Point Method</b><br />Sreejith Appukuttan<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-196.html'>Mathematical Problems and Simulations in the Applications of Transport Theory - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Reverse Osmosis (RO) is a promising technology to address the impending water-crisis in the upcoming decades. RO at high salinities and high pressures is challenging due to membrane compaction that changes its porosity and permeability. In this study, we present a simulation methodology for membrane structural mechanics to understand pore size distribution and permeability variations under high pressure. We use the material point method (MPM), that solves the solid mechanics equations in a Lagrangian framework. MPM provides many features that make it well-suited for simulating mesoporous membranes. The Lagrangian framework allows for large deformations, easy integration of constitutive models and direct import of complex geometries as particles. The spatial discretization in our MPM solver is achieved using linear or cubic-spline shape functions while the time integration is carried out using the explicit Euler method. A series of images containing detailed pore structures obtained from X-ray tomography is first converted to a collection of material points. Compressive loads are applied to the top layer of the membrane to simulate the application of pressure. The membrane deformation and pore size distribution before and after load application are reported and compared with the experimental measurements. The presentation discusses the numerical methods used, the performance of the solver on high-performance computing machines, and the results of membrane compact in detail.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75502' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1218)' class='star'><span class='star1218'>&star;</span></a> Muhammad Ridwan Apriansyah  <span id='bitlink-1959'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1959)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1959' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1959)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Parallel QR Factorization of Block Low-Rank Matrices</b><br />Muhammad Ridwan Apriansyah<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-267.html'>Approximate Computing for Scientific Applications - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Block Low-Rank (BLR) matrices are a compact representation that can reduce the storage and computational costs of factorizing dense matrices arising from a wide range of scientific applications. We present two new algorithms to perform QR factorization of BLR-matrices: one that performs blocked Householder QR, and another that is based on the fine-grained tiled Householder QR. We show how the blocked algorithm exploits BLR structure to achieve arithmetic complexity of $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, while the tiled algorithm exhibits $\mathcal{O}(mn^{1.5})$ complexity. We also present the parallelization of these algorithms and show that the tiled algorithm allows for highly-parallel task-based execution thanks to its finer task granularity. We compare our algorithms with an existing BLR-QR algorithm based on Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) iteration and a state-of-the-art vendor-optimized dense Householder QR in Intel MKL. For a matrix of size 131k $\times$ 65k, our methods are more than an order of magnitude faster than the dense QR in MKL. Our methods are also robust to ill-conditioning compared to the existing MGS-based method that suffers from numerical instability.

It is known that the 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, Prx1 and Prx2, not only control cytoplasmic H2O2 concentrations but can also mediate H2O2 signalling. Recent experiments indicate that H2O2 signalling at the cytosol of human cells is spatially localised. In this talk we will present and discuss reaction-diffusion model of the cytosolic human peroxiredoxin (Prdx)-based system that accounts for the differential kinetic parameters. The results confirm that H2O2 signalling at the cytosol of human cells is spatially localised and that site-specific scaffold proteins allow H2O2 released to the cytosol at distinct sites to independently regulate distinct genes and processes.

By exploiting the structure of the governing equations for a low-dimensional subspace, the constructed reduced-order model typically 1) achieves significant computational savings, 2) builds upon established error theory to guarantee approximation accuracy, and 3) remains interpretable in terms of the governing physical equations. However, by construction projection-based methods require access to the full-order operators — a major shortcoming for large-scale applications with legacy codes or commercial solvers. Operator Inference methods circumvent this requirement by learning the intrusive reduced-order model from available full-order data and the structure of the governing equations. The method guarantees exact reconstruction in the limit or by applying an additional re-projection technique — if sufficient data is available to stabilize the learning problem. In this talk, we exploit the projective structure of the reduced operators for a nested operator inference approach that continues to guarantee exact reconstruction with re-projection while significantly reducing the data requirement from polynomial scaling to O(1). This in particular makes the nested Operator Inference approach applicable for high-order polynomial operators that were previously infeasible to infer.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75222' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1785)' class='star'><span class='star1785'>&star;</span></a> Adeeb Arif Kor  <span id='bitlink-1963'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1963)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1963' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1963)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fast Finite Element Solver for Focused Ultrasound Applications</b><br />Adeeb Arif Kor<br />Monday, February 27 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-392.html'>Exascale Applications of High-Order PDE Solvers - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>Focused ultrasound (FUS) application is a therapeutic medical technology that uses ultrasound for tissue heating and ablation. In recent years, interest in FUS application has been growing, especially for the treatment of some cancers. In contrast to conventional cancer therapy, FUS application is non-invasive and as such makes it an attractive treatment method. However, effective patient-specific FUS treatment would be supported by accurate simulations of treatment. This presents a computational challenge as the ratio of the domain size to the wavelength is typically large, and therefore computationally demanding. We have developed a fast, high-order matrix-free finite element solvers to simulate a 3D FUS application. We show that by employing a high-order methods and fast assembly techniques, we simulate with high accuracy and acceptable computation time. We show that we can use methods with the lowest known computational cost complexity and achieve a very significant fraction of the peak performance of modern CPU architectures, and with excellent parallel scalability. Overall, we show that our solver is fast, accurate, scalable, and is suitable for large-scale time-domain nonlinear acoustics simulations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75868' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1296)' class='star'><span class='star1296'>&star;</span></a> Daniel Arndt  <span id='bitlink-1964'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1964)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1964' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1964)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Implementing a SYCL Backend for Kokkos</b><br />Daniel Arndt<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-286.html'>SYCL's Impact on Algorithms, Data Structures and Implementations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Aurora, to be deployed at Argonne National Laboratory, is expected to be the next exascale computer in the United States.

The associated computational challenges motivate the investigation of numerical techniques that can decouple the time integration of the governing equations in the liquid electrolyte and the solid phase (active materials and current collectors). First, it is shown that semi-discretisation in space of the governing equations leads to a system of index-$1$ differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Then, a new generation of strategies for multi-domain integration is presented, enabling high-order adaptive coupling in time of both domains. A simple $1$D LIB code is implemented as a demonstrator of the new strategy for the simulation of charge, discharge, and relaxation. The integration of the decoupled subsystems is performed with high-order accurate implicit nonlinear solvers. A fully coupled monolithic time integration scheme is also presented as reference. The accuracy of the space discretisation is assessed by comparing numerical results to analytical solutions. Then, temporal convergence studies demonstrate the accuracy of the new multi-domain coupling approach. Finally, considerations on its computational efficiency are also discussed. It is believed that this new approach will constitute a key ingredient for full-scale $3$D simulations based on actual electrode microstructures.

This strategy avoids specialized quadrature in the volume and utilizes high throughput fast algorithms that are available in simple geometries. Recently, methods for function extension have been proposed which leverage the relative simplicity of one dimensional function extrapolation: extrapolation is performed only in the direction normal to the domain boundary and interpolation is performed tangentially. We propose a high order and efficient framework for extrapolation in this style which is suitable for both uniform and adaptive discretizations.

Rapid growth assays are inaccurate yet convenient, while robust measures of cell number can be time-consuming to the point of limiting experimentation. In this talk, we describe the use of multi-information source Bayesian optimization to optimize a cell culture media with 14 components. Following this approach, we were able to design media with 181% more cells than a common commercial variant with a similar economic cost while doing so in 38% fewer experiments than an efficient design-of-experiments method. Furthermore, the optimal medium generalized well to long-term growth up to four passages of C2C12 cells, indicating the multi-information source assay improved measurement robustness relative to rapid growth assays alone.

This work employs data-driven and physics-based modeling techniques to capture and predict the response to burst-type momentum-injection actuation near the leading edge of a stalled NACA0009 airfoil, utilizing data from direct numerical simulations. The response to this type of actuation can be decomposed into two components: a short-time response that is characterized by an initial decrease followed by an increase in the lift, and a long-time response that can be sensitive to the instantaneous wake state at the onset of actuation. Theoretical models are developed using assumptions from classical unsteady aerodynamic theory, which provide insight into the form that the data-driven models should take. The data-driven models, which are identified using variants of dynamic mode decomposition, are capable of capturing both the short- and long-time response of the system to actuation. We additionally show how physics-based approaches can extract spectral content from systems with limited data available, with applications for vortex interactions in wake flows.

Common challenges for such methods are the automatic  choice of good or even optimal interpolation points as well as a  suitable size for the reduced-order model.  An approach that tackles the first problem for linear, unstructured  systems is the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA), which  computes optimal interpolation points by iterative updates solving  linear eigenvalue problems.  However, in the case of structured systems, the eigenvalue problems  resulting from the corresponding transfer functions are nonlinear  such that the number of potential new interpolation points exceeds  the order of the reduced model.  In our work, we propose an IRKA-inspired iterative interpolation method  for structured systems to compute near-optimal interpolation points  as well as a suitable size for the reduced-order model.  Thereby, the iterative updates of the expansion points are chosen   to yield accurate approximations in specified frequency ranges of  interest.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75470' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1705)' class='star'><span class='star1705'>&star;</span></a> Anthony Austin  <span id='bitlink-1976'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1976)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1976' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1976)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Parallel Preconditioner for a Family of Parameterized Linear Systems with Applications to Frequency Response Analysis</b><br />Anthony Austin<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-377.html'>Advances and Challenges in Eigensolutions and Industrial Applications - Part II o II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75825' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2055)' class='star'><span class='star2055'>&star;</span></a> Ilze Amanda Auzina  <span id='bitlink-1977'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1977)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1977' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1977)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Learning Latent Dynamics with Informative Constraints</b><br />Ilze Amanda Auzina<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-45.html'>Operator Learning in the Physical and Data Sciences - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>For many complex systems the parametric form of the differential equation might be unknown or infeasible to determine. Earlier works have explored to model the unknown ODE system with a Neural Network or with a Gaussian Process model. However, NN are prone to overfit, while GPs are limited to a low dimensional data setting. To extend GPs to high-dimensional data setting we propose a novel framework by combining a generative and a Bayesian nonparametric model, called VAE-GP-ODE. Our model learns a physically meaningful latent representation (position, momentum) and solves in the latent space an ODE system. The use of GP allows us to account for uncertainty as well as to extend our work with informative priors forming a constraint on the model. Moreover, we extend our work by proposing an disentanglement between the dynamic states and the time-invariant variables, enabling robust latent ODE models that can generalize across different settings. We demonstrate our framework on video sequences and low-dimensional oscillating systems. Our VAE-GP-ODE with informative prior obtains state-of-the-art performance compared to earlier GP-based ODEs models for dynamic forecasting, while our disentanglement framework results in improved long-term predictions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75265' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(820)' class='star'><span class='star820'>&star;</span></a> Angelica I.

With the availability of large amounts of network data, it is important to be able to reduce the network’s dimensionality and extract useful information from it. A key approach to network data reduction is community detection. Early work in graph-based community detection methods has focused on static networks. This type of networks is usually considered as an oversimplification as many real-world complex systems exhibit variation in their community structure over time. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop algorithms that detect the community structure and track its evolution across time. In this talk, we will present low-rank matrix and tensor decomposition methods for community detection in dynamic networks. The first part of the talk will focus on a low-rank + sparse model for evolutionary spectral clustering to detect and track the community structure in temporal weighted and binary networks. We will then extend this framework by considering a tensor formulation of the time-varying networks and introduce a low-rank tensor model to identify and track the community structure. The performance of the proposed methods will be illustrated on various benchmark network models as well as real networks from a variety of applications.

An ideal model is simple enough for system interpretability and control, but rich enough to capture essential nonlinearities. Efficient reduction of very high-dimensional datasets is another challenge.    
In our approach, we use spectral submanifolds (SSMs) as reduced spaces. Specifically, an SSM is the unique smoothest nonlinear continuation of a spectral subspace from a steady state. After identification of the SSM, we compute its dynamics in the Poincaré normal form.     
The recently presented SSMLearn algorithm identifies SSMs from data via nonlinear optimization. While broadly applicable, this method is too computationally costly to handle higher-dimensional data. Here, we introduce a simplified method, fastSSM. Our main assumption is to estimate the tangent space of the SSM via singular value decomposition. Furthermore, the normal form dynamics are computed analytically rather than via implicit optimization.    
This entails a speedup of several orders of magnitude, allowing analysis of higher-dimensional datasets. We demonstrate this by training on a full surface profile signal from tank sloshing experiments. Furthermore, we show that our algorithms can capture the loss of stability and transition between buckling states with data from a FE beam simulation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75560' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(85)' class='star'><span class='star85'>&star;</span></a> Atakan Aygun  <span id='bitlink-1983'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1983)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1983' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1983)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Boltzmann-BGK Equations with Absorbing Boundary Layers</b><br />Atakan Aygun<br />Friday, March 3 10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-18.html'>Data-Driven Predictive Modeling in Computational Science - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>We introduce the application of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for Boltzmann-BGK equations for nearly incompressible flows.

A fundamental property of DEC is that it naturally satisfies the relation $d^2=0$ to machine precision, where $d$ is the discrete exterior differential operator. This relation is essential as it describes both identities $curl \ grad =0$ and $div \ curl =0$ of the vector calculus. Thus, ensuring these relations at the discrete level circumvents parasitic solutions. Many attempts have been made to predict flows by DEC, and the stream-function approach is often preferred due to its pressure-free formulation. For many other applications where the explicit computation of the pressure is required, we need to solve the governing equations in primary variables (velocity-pressure). In this case, Chorin’s projection scheme based on the Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition can be used. It consists of predicting an intermediate velocity field, which is subsequently projected onto a solenoidal space via a Poisson equation for the pressure with Neumann boundary conditions. In this presentation, a projection scheme adapted to DEC is formulated. In particular, we show how Neumann boundary conditions can be incorporated into the DEC formulation, independent of the choice of the discrete Hodge operator. Validation experiments are performed in a benchmark simulation: lid-driven cavity flow. We show, for different Reynolds numbers, that our results very accurately match those in the literature.

Existing work on sequential disentanglement mostly provides two factor representations, i.e., it separates the data to time-varying and time-invariant factors. In contrast, we consider multifactor disentanglement in which multiple (more than two) semantic disentangled components are generated. Key to our approach is a strong inductive bias where we assume that the underlying dynamics can be represented linearly in the latent space. Under this assumption, it becomes natural to exploit the recently introduced Koopman autoencoder models. However, disentangled representations are not guaranteed in Koopman approaches, and thus we propose a novel spectral loss term which leads to structured Koopman matrices and disentanglement. Overall, we propose a simple and easy to code new deep model that is fully unsupervised and it supports multifactor disentanglement. We showcase new disentangling abilities such as swapping of individual static factors between characters, and an incremental swap of disentangled factors from the source to the target. Moreover, we evaluate our method extensively on two factor standard benchmark tasks where we significantly improve over competing unsupervised approaches, and we perform competitively in comparison to weakly- and self-supervised state-of-the-art approaches.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75500' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(382)' class='star'><span class='star382'>&star;</span></a> Zainal Aziz  <span id='bitlink-1986'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1986)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1986' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1986)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Pde Analysis of Real-World Problem - Groundwater Modelling</b><br />Zainal Aziz<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-85.html'>Mathematics for Industry in the Asia Pacific Area - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>A new academic-business model involving a strategic collaborative effort between a mathematical science-based research centre and a business-entrepreneurial entity is suggested. This model is framed within a Quadruple Helix (QH) structure, with four main distinct clusters (government, industry, academia and community user). This academic-business model is then implemented via a proposed mathematical/industrial mathematics modelling activity, which is essentially rested on the knowledge transfer mechanism and entrepreneurial process. This underlying activity apparently would fulfil our sequence of steps in the modelling of a real-world problem within QH framework. This programme is then applied to a real-world industrial problem. This problem would link up to the QH clusters and is described by a presumed workable industrial problem, incorporating PDE analysis and Green function method on Surface Water (SW), Riverbank Filtration (RBF) and Groundwater (GW) modelling. The main goal is to generate an integrated water management scheme which would ensure an optimal conjunctive use of SW, RBF and GW sources of treated clean water, thus preventing unscheduled disruption of clean water supply to Water Authority account holders. The final outcome is to achieve and sustain a reasonably practicable and optimal conjunctive/integrated water management system for a community of Water Authority users.

To achieve this objective, we studied the stability of the equilibrium points of our biological model then we added in our model the effect of the tides in the fishing effort which maximizes the profits of the fishermen under the constraint of the conservation of the biodiversity of these marine species using the generalized Nash equilibrium in the resolution of the bioeconomic model. As results, we were able to give the best fishing times according to the tides of each month of the whole year which will allow us to achieve better yields. Hence the importance of introducing the effect of high and low tides in bioeconomic models.

DBO is an on-the-fly low-rank approximation technique, in which the instantaneous composition matrix of the reactive flow field is decomposed into a set of orthonormal spatial modes, a set of orthonormal vectors in the composition space, and a factorization of the low-rank correlation matrix. This approach bypasses the need to solve the full-dimensional set of species transport equations to generate high-fidelity data as is commonly performed in data-driven dimension reduction techniques such as the principal component analysis (PCA). Because of these features, DBO can adapt on-the-fly to intrinsic and externally excited transient changes in state of the transport variables. A demonstration case of DBO-based ROM of reacting transport equations exhibiting strongly transient combustion phenomena including flame propagation, end-gas auto-ignition and developing detonation is presented using a 39-species gasoline surrogate mechanism. A-posteriori comparisons against the data generated via full-rank direct numerical simulation (DNS) as well as the PCA reduction of the DNS data is carried out to highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of the DBO based ROM of compressible reacting flows.

One of the parameters that influences the predictions is the basal sliding coefficient. We consider the problem of inferring the basal sliding coefficient of an ice sheet from noisy surface velocity measurements. The dynamics of the ice are modeled by a nonlinear Stokes equation. Inference is further complicated by the fact that the rheological parameters are unknown and uncertain. The standard approach would be to jointly infer the basal sliding coefficient and rheological parameters. However, the rheological parameters are not of primary interest and are distributed throughout the domain, thus greatly increasing the computational costs and ill-posedness associated with the problem. To avoid carrying out joint inference, we employ the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach which allows for offline premarginization over the rheological parameters.     
We show numerical examples which demonstrate that incorrectly fixing the rheological parameters may result in unphysical artifacts in the reconstructed basal sliding coefficient, and posterior infeasibility (ie. true parameter is not supported by the posterior model) due to underestimation of uncertainty in the reconstructions.

In this contribution, we consider two ways of generating these projection functions data-based and physics-based approaches. In a data-based method called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to training data to obtain the projection function. In contrast, in the physics-based approach, named Linear manifold(LM), the dynamic eigenmodes of the system are extended using modal derivatives that can capture the effect of nonlinear kinematics. In this contribution, we intend to model quasi-statics of the same high-fidelity problem to observe the difference between these methods. To this extent, we propose a residual parameter in the reduced space for both these methods and an additional mode selection algorithm for the physics-based method(LM). As a start, we assess the performance of both these methods on problems involving geometric nonlinearity. The results showed that the displacement error for these methods for problems involving simple loading scenarios falls below 1 %, and an approx. time gain of 30 % with the original FE calculation. The difference in these methods has been visible in complex loading scenarios, where LM takes less number of modes in comparison to POD to reach an error below 1 %, but the time gain remained the same.

Similar to the existing adaptive low-rank method for elliptic problems, the method is based on a perturbed Richardson iteration, in the present case applied to a standard space-time variational formulation of the parabolic initial-boundary value problem. The analysis of the method requires a new approximation class for the temporal operator, taking into account the interaction between hierarchical tensor formats of different time indices. Since the parabolic operator is an isomorphism with respect to spaces not endowed with a cross norm, we devise a new low-rank preconditioning scheme based on exponential sum approximations that is adapted to the parabolic case. The method is shown to converge and satisfy similar complexity bounds as the existing adaptive low-rank methods for elliptic problems, establishing its suitability for parabolic problems on high-dimensional spatial domains and does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The construction also yields computable rigorous a posteriori error bounds for the total error depending on the activated basis functions and ranks in the approximation.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75372' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1513)' class='star'><span class='star1513'>&star;</span></a> Brett Bader  <span id='bitlink-1994'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1994)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1994' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1994)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data Science and Analysis with Earth Imaging Satellites</b><br />Brett Bader<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-333.html'>Career Opportunities in Computational Science and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Maxar Technologies operates a constellation of high-resolution earth imaging satellites with varying spectral capabilities.

These graphs may include social networks, computer networks, and genomes. In this talk, we present our novel graph package, Arachne, to make large-scale graph analytics more effortless and efficient based on the open-source Arkouda framework. Arkouda has been developed to allow users to perform massively parallel computations on distributed data with an interface similar to NumPy. In this package, we developed a fundamental sparse graph data structure and then built several useful graph algorithms around our data structure to form a basic algorithmic library. Benchmarks and tools were also developed to evaluate and demonstrate the use of our graph algorithms. The graph algorithms we have implemented thus far include breadth-first search (BFS), connected components (CC), k-Truss (KT), Jaccard coefficients (JC), triangle counting (TC), and triangle centrality (TCE). Their corresponding experimental results based on realworld and synthetic graphs are presented. Arachne is organized as an Arkouda extension package and is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75193' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(252)' class='star'><span class='star252'>&star;</span></a> Santiago Badia  <span id='bitlink-1996'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1996)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1996' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1996)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Synergies Between Neural Networks and Finite Elements</b><br />Santiago Badia<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-55.html'>Novel Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>The direct numerical approximation of PDEs using neural networks is gaining lots of attraction, but many problems still need to be solved. One is the numerical integration of the resulting terms (which involves integrating the neural network and its derivatives). Monte Carlo is the most common approach but suffers a low convergence rate. Another problem is the required regularity of the neural network to end up with a differentiable functional. E.g., ReLU activation functions are not regular enough, even for weak formulations. In this presentation, we will discuss how to design effective adaptive quadratures for smooth enough activation functions and compare the proposed approach with Monte Carlo methods.    
Alternatively, we explore using interpolated neural networks on finite element spaces to compute the PDE loss function instead of dealing with the neural network itself. Doing this, the integration is straightforward. However, this approach relies on a mesh. In this situation, we also discuss the ill-posedness of standard PDE losses and how to design well-posed preconditioned losses. We show how by combining standard finite element preconditioners and neural networks, we can substantially accelerate the training process, one of the most severe issues of neural network PDE approximations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75281' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1821)' class='star'><span class='star1821'>&star;</span></a> Tim Baer  <span id='bitlink-1997'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1997)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1997' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1997)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Sparse Matrix Kernels for Parallel Graph Algorithms</b><br />Tim Baer<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-401.html'>Emerging Techniques for Scalable Graph Processing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Sparse matrix algebra has emerged as an expressive and powerful framework for designing parallel algorithms for graph problems including all-pairs shortest paths, betweenness centrality, and connectivity. We employ this framework to design scalable routines for two key sparse kernels arising in parallel minimum spanning forest (MSF) and single-source shortest path (SSSP) algorithms. In particular, we target the hooking step of the Awerbuch-Shiloach MSF algorithm and the nearest neighbor search leveraged by the low hop emulator SSSP construction (Andoni, Stein, Zhong, STOC 20). We introduce a multilinear kernel that operates on an adjacency matrix and two vectors to eliminate a write bottleneck common to both steps. This kernel updates vertices by simultaneously using information from an edge and its two adjacent vertices. We implement these routines with Cyclops, a distributed-memory library for generalized sparse tensor algebra. We analyze the parallel scalability of our implementations on the Stampede2 supercomputer.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75881' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(526)' class='star'><span class='star526'>&star;</span></a> Shervin Bagheri  <span id='bitlink-1998'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1998)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1998' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1998)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards Learning to Rank and Decompose Rough Surfaces Based on Drag Penalty</b><br />Shervin Bagheri<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-115.html'>Reduced-Complexity Models for Fluid Flows - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Turbulent flows over irregular rough surfaces are ubiquitous in both nature and industry. Roughness increases the momentum transfer near the wall and the hydrodynamic drag on the wall. The increase of drag depends on various topographic features. Several studies have investigated the effects of statistical parameters of roughness topography on the increase of hydrodynamic drag. However, no generally applicable statistical model exists that can accurately predict drag on various rough surfaces (e.g., gaussian surfaces, positively and negatively skewed surfaces, etc.).  Moreover, many models struggle to properly " rank” the rough surfaces based on drag penalty. In practice, ranking the drag penalties from rough surfaces is generally more critical than estimating the absolute value of drag itself. This presentation will introduce attempts to “rank” rough surfaces using various machine learning techniques based on their drag penalties. In addition, we will discuss distinctive roughness structures suspected to increase drag significantly by decomposing modes of feature maps in convolutional neural networks.

Among other types of uncertainty they faced are knowledge uncertainties, natural uncertainties, and decisions to be made under uncertainties.  In an oil refinery, uncertainties in the supply and product demand cover all aspects of uncertainties. This talk will present how stochastic programming parameters be estimated to help oil refinery planners make decisions when the supply and demand in the industry are hit by the rapid fluctuations in oil prices. The fluctuations in oil prices and unstable product demands result in disruption at procurement, production, and inventory stages. The parameters and the types of uncertainties involved in this project were identified through literature and discussion with industry practitioners. Then, an accurate forecast is required to quantify the uncertainties in the oil prices dependent on the behaviour of its volatility.  In this talk, the successful implementation of the project will also be highlighted.

The equations account for both the diffusive interactions between chemical species and the bulk convection. Our aim is to develop computationally efficient high-order finite element schemes that discretize these nonlinear equations in two and three spatial dimensions. Because the SOSM equations relate many unknown variables (e.g. the bulk and species velocities, pressure, concentrations, chemical potentials, etc.), this is a difficult task. In particular, there are many choices of which variables should be explicitly solved for in the formulation, and it is not clear which discrete finite element function spaces should be employed. To tackle this challenge, we derive a novel weak formulation of the SOSM problem in which the species mass fluxes are treated as unknowns. We show that this new formulation naturally leads to a large class of high-order finite element discretizations that are straightforward to implement and have desirable linear-algebraic properties. Moreover, from a theoretical standpoint, we are able to prove that when applied to a linearized version of the SOSM problem, the proposed finite element schemes are convergent. Our findings are illustrated with numerical experiments.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75550' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1182)' class='star'><span class='star1182'>&star;</span></a> Joseph Bakarji  <span id='bitlink-2003'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2003)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2003' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2003)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Discovering Reduced Order Models from Partial Measurements with Deep Delay Autoencoders</b><br />Joseph Bakarji<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-260.html'>Reduced Order Modeling of Differential Equations Through Deep Learning Algorithms - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>A central challenge in data-driven model discovery is the presence of hidden, or latent, variables that are not directly measured but are dynamically important. We develop a deep latent-model autoencoder that simultaneously optimizes for a nonlinear transformation that projects the measurement data on an effective coordinate system and discovers a sparse differential equation governing the latent variable. Our approach is motivated by Takens' theorem which provides conditions for when it is possible to augment partial measurements with time delayed information, resulting in an attractor that is diffeomorphic to that of the original full-state system. We show that the proposed architecture can discover a coordinate transformation from the delay embedded space into a new space where it is possible to represent the dynamics in a sparse, closed form, differential equation.  Furthermore, we show how this architecture can be used for discovering reduced order models from given partial or full measurements of the system. We demonstrate this approach on the Lorenz, Rössler, and Lotka-Volterra systems, learning dynamics from a single measurement variable. As a challenging example, we learn a Lorenz analogue from a single scalar variable extracted from a video of a chaotic waterwheel experiment.

The shape graphs are represented by a set of nodes and a set of edges (planar articulated curves) connecting some of these nodes. The goals are to utilize shapes of edges and connectivities and locations of nodes to: (1) characterize full shapes, (2) quantify shape differences, and (3) model statistical variability. We develop a mathematical representation, elastic Riemannian shape metrics, and associated tools for such statistical analysis. Specifically, we derive tools for graph matching,  shape geodesics, shape summaries, and shape modeling.   One key challenge here is the registration of nodes across large   graphs and we develop a novel multi-scale representation of shape graphs to handle this challenge. We utilize the concepts of (1) "effective resistance" to cluster nodes and (2) elastic shape averaging of edge curves, to change graph details while maintaining overall structures. Registration is then performed by bringing graphs to similar scales before matching. We demonstrate these ideas on Retinal Blood Vessel (RBV) networks taken from the STARE and DRIVE databases.

Especially in a design context, where material properties, geometry and stacking sequence are varied, the computing time required by the finite element analyses becomes prohibitive. This has motivated the idea of data-driven composite failure prediction, where a data-based model learns from relatively few numerical simulations and it can later generalize to unseen input (e.g. loading) conditions.    
Even though most machine learning models are trained on classical computers, quantum computers can also learn from data. In fact, operations on quantum bits are continuous and can be tuned in a hybrid quantum-classical optimization loop. Since the model is a quantum circuit, it is evaluated on quantum hardware, while the parameters are updated classically.    
Thanks to the properties of quantum mechanics, quantum models proved able to learn functions that classical machine learning models cannot learn, especially in classification tasks. However, the datasets used were 'fabricated' such to be easily classified by the quantum circuit.    
As one of the first practical applications, this work explored the power of quantum machine learning models in the practical scenario of learning composite structures failure and compared it to that of classical data-driven models.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75547' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2054)' class='star'><span class='star2054'>&star;</span></a> Pierre Balty  <span id='bitlink-2006'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2006)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2006' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2006)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>FLUPS: A Versatile and Performant FFT-Based Library of Unbounded Poisson Solvers</b><br />Pierre Balty<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-143.html'>Next Generation FFT Algorithms in Theory and Practice: Parallel Implementations and Applications</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>Massively parallel Fourier transforms are widely used in computational sciences, and specifically  in computational fluid dynamics simulations of incompressible external flows which involves unbounded  Poisson problems. In this talk, we present a library of unbounded Poisson solvers (FLUPS)  for 2D and 3D distributed uniform grids, tailored for massively parallel architectures. The multidimensional  Fourier transform is performed as a succession of 1D FFTs using FFTW, while we  propose three different communication strategies for the reordering and parallel redistribution  of the data between each transform: one all-to-all implementation and two non-blocking implementations  using manual packing or MPI Datatype. The proposed software is validated against  analytical solutions for unbounded, semi-unbounded, and periodic domains. The performance  of the approaches is then compared against another distributed FFT implementation, using a  periodic problem.

As complete projective synchronization is impossible due to parameters’ mismatches projective coefficient and controller, a drive has been taken to achieve quasi-projective synchronization of distinct complex-valued CGNNs. The purpose of this study is to find a criterion for quasi-projective synchronization of two non-identical CGNNs  by constructing a suitable controller and by using direct method. The important contribution is to estimate the bound on the synchronization error. Some sufficient criteria for synchronization between master and response systems are also established.  The efficiency of the proposed method is justified through numerical simulation applied to a specific example.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75421' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1667)' class='star'><span class='star1667'>&star;</span></a> Hosseini Bamdad  <span id='bitlink-2008'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2008)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2008' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2008)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Error Analysis of Measure Transport Problems in Data Science</b><br />Hosseini Bamdad<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-369.html'>Variational Inference: From Theory to Practice - Part I of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Measure transport problems have become prevalent in data science and machine learning, from generative adversarial networks and normalizing flows to optimal transport.

This renders the computational costs associated with solving a non-linear forward problem to be exorbitant. Furthermore, while there exist intrusive and non-intrusive machine learning (ML) based hyper-reduction techniques, the corresponding offline and online training phase is inefficient. With state-of-the-art methods in mind, a numerical framework is needed that offers: (i) a significant improvement in the generalization accuracy for the unknown solution and the derived quantities when the full-order training data is limited, (ii) an efficient offline training phase in the sense that an improved sampling strategy is invoked to identify where to perform the full-order solve, and (iii) an offline- and online-efficient, physically consistent, non-intrusive affine decomposition and hyper-reduction technique. To this end, inspired from the reduced basis empirical quadrature procedure (RB-EQP) and scientific ML techniques, we develop a novel, non-intrusive numerical method, trained using pretraining and semi-supervised learning strategies, to efficiently and cheaply solve non-linear forward multiscale mechanics problems. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on a hyper elasticity and a coupled thermo-electro-mechanical problem in a multi-scale framework.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75596' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(519)' class='star'><span class='star519'>&star;</span></a> Brian Bantsoukissa  <span id='bitlink-2011'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2011)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2011' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2011)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards a Modified Nested Dissection Ordering to Enhance Low-Rank Compressibility in Sparse Direct Solvers</b><br />Brian Bantsoukissa<br />Wednesday, March 1 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-113.html'>Sparse Computations in Science and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>The advent of rank-structured compression techniques for the solution of large-scale sparse linear systems has been demonstrated to significantly reduce both the computational cost and the memory footprint of sparse direct solvers. The block low-rank (BLR) compression format exploits the blockwise low-rank property of sparse matrices that arise in many scientific applications. In this talk, we investigate the potential of new combinatorial algorithms that enhance BLR solvers through the computation of a smarter ordering of the unknowns prior to the factorization phase. Our purely algebraic approach aims to bridge the gap between traditional dense and sparse linear algebra methods, and improve compression rates at the cost of additional fill-in. Instead of building low-rank clusters on top of nested dissection, we adopt an alternative approach by clustering the unknowns before exhibiting a nested dissection on top of it. We demonstrate the efficiency of this new approach by means of experiments that have been conducted for the PaStiX solver.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75389' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(368)' class='star'><span class='star368'>&star;</span></a> Feng Bao  <span id='bitlink-2012'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2012)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2012' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2012)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stochastic Methods for Machine Learning</b><br />Feng Bao<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-82.html'>Optimization, Design, and Machine Learning in the FASTMath SciDAC-5 Institute - Part II of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>We develop a backward stochastic differential equation based probabilistic machine learning method, which formulates a class of stochastic neural networks as a stochastic optimal control problem.

Knowledge of this sparse edge structure is valuable for modeling multivariate distributions and for performing inference and prediction tasks. While several algorithms have been developed to learn the graph structure for Gaussian data, consistent methods for continuous and non-Gaussian distributions remain limited. In this presentation, we propose a structure learning algorithm based on a non-Gaussian characterization of conditional independence that uses Hessian information of the joint density. For a broad class of distributions, we show that the Hessian is related to conditional mutual information, a classical measure of conditional independence, while being more tractable for computation. To estimate the Hessian, our algorithm estimates the density using a deterministic coupling, known as a transport map, and exploits the sparse structure in the map to reveal the sparsity in the graph. We present results for learning the graph structure of non-Gaussian datasets drawn from chaotic dynamical systems, biology, and multi-disciplinary engineering systems where the graph structure arises from couplings between subdomain models.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75386' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(289)' class='star'><span class='star289'>&star;</span></a> Robert Baraldi  <span id='bitlink-2014'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2014)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2014' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2014)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Proximal Subproblem Solvers for An Inexact Nonsmooth Trust-Region Method</b><br />Robert Baraldi<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-63.html'>Algorithms for Nonsmooth, Nonconvex Optimization - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Minimizing the sum of a smooth and nonsmooth function has been the core  structure of many optimization applications in recent years.  These include  basis pursuit de-noise problems in data science, optimal control of partial  differential equations, and, more generally, where inverse problems desire  sparsity in the optimized parameters.  In previous work, we developed novel  trust-region methods that minimize the sum of a smooth, nonconvex and a nonsmooth yet convex function. A question left open by both such work is how to solve the subproblem, which is often a quadratic model of the smooth component added to either the nonsmooth regularizer or a model of the regularizer.  This work elaborates on potential trust-region subproblem solvers for various assumptions on the nonsmooth component. We extend our inexactness criteria to the nonsmooth regularizer and the evaluation of proximal operators, which form the core of the trust region routine. For convex nonsmooth regularizers, we describe variations of a spectral projected gradient algorithm, a nonlinear conjugate gradient routine, and a dogleg method. Finally, we illustrate performance on numerical examples in PDE-constrained optimization.

We formulate the inverse model problem as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, where the objective function measures the discrepancy between observations and predictions. We will discuss different strategies for learning the space varying elasticity coefficients, which include the use of neural networks.

We see clear differences between how different research communities approach developing, supporting and using software on large scale facilities from the analysis – for example, some communities have a small number of general-purpose software packages used by many researchers, other communities have a much broader range of software packages used by smaller numbers of researchers. We provide some initial thoughts as to why these differences exist and their potential implications from a researcher and service productivity perspective. The analysis tool has recently been extended to provide insight into differences in energy use by different communities and software packages and we present initial findings from this data and how it can potentially support the transition of large-scale HPC facilities to net zero emissions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75714' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1076)' class='star'><span class='star1076'>&star;</span></a> Joshua Barnett  <span id='bitlink-2018'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2018)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2018' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2018)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Piecewise Quadratic Approximation Manifold for Nonlinear Projection-Based Model Order Reduction</b><br />Joshua Barnett<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-236.html'>Recent Advances in Nonlinear Model Reduction for Computational Mechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>A piecewise quadratic approximation manifold is proposed for mitigating the Kolmogorov barrier to projection-based model order reduction (PMOR). After the computed solution snapshots are clustered, each local model is trained in two steps using an approach that builds on the data-driven procedure underlying the construction of traditional (affine) projection-based reduced order models (PROMs). The overall approach is application-independent and linearization-free. Consequently, it is more robust than alternative approaches for the solution of highly nonlinear problems. If for a convection-dominated turbulent flow problem a PMOR method equipped with the traditional piecewise-affine approximation delivers a certain level of accuracy using a local PROM of average  dimension $n$, the proposed PMOR approach produces a piecewise quadratic PROM that delivers a similar level of accuracy using however an average local dimension of roughly $\sqrt{2n}$. It is shown that when implemented within the least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) PMOR method and equipped with the energy conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) hyperreduction method, the proposed piecewise quadratic approximation manifold accelerates the solution of a benchmark turbulent flow problem by more than four orders of magnitude. It also accelerates the solution of such a problem using a traditional PROM by two orders of magnitude.

Hence, traditional global loop-based parallelism and notably the bulk-synchronous/BSP paradigm will become insufficient, and developers might have to go back to the drawing board and uncover alternatives to equip their code with higher concurrency. A candidate solution for this is task parallelism, which frames an algorithm in terms of tasks that can be executed concurrently by different processors. In this talk, I will introduce a newly developed, task-based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code integrated within the Peano/ExaHyPE framework. I will discuss the main features of the code such as the modelling of the compute steps and tasks in terms of the transversal of mesh hierarchies (dubbed spacetrees) as well as simulation results for standard SPH benchmarks. Furthermore, I will discuss the integration of a C++ extension with a memory-centric specification language into the SPH code which adds features that can improve the performance of large-scale simulations, such as reordering data temporarily from an array of structures (AoS) into a structure of arrays (SoA) and the compression of floats with arbitrary precision.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75778' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1682)' class='star'><span class='star1682'>&star;</span></a> Aaron Barrett  <span id='bitlink-2020'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2020)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2020' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2020)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards Models of Blood Clotting on Moving Surfaces</b><br />Aaron Barrett<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-372.html'>Immersed Boundary and Related Methods: Advances in Methodology and Biological Applications - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Blood clotting is a complex phenomenon which involves interplay between biochemistry and fluid-structure interactions. For example, subclinical leaflet thrombosis is a potentially serious complication of aortic valve replacement in which clots form on the replacement valve. Clots in the left atrial appendage can dislodge during atrial fibrillation, which leads to an increased risk of strokes. Models of thrombosis in these kinds of systems must take into account the motion of both the structure and thrombus as well as the biochemistry to accurately describe formation of the thrombus. Herein, we describe recent approaches to model the clotting process within the context of fluid-structure interaction. We focus on two key components of thrombus modeling: deposition of material onto surfaces, and the growth of the thrombus into the lumen. While the methods presented are applied to clotting problems, these methods can also be used to model deposition and absorption along other moving boundaries, such as drug absorption in the gut or particulate deposition in the lungs.

Currently this need is addressed by expensive, time consuming, and environmentally wasteful destructive testing of physical replica components. However, with more and more connected sensors being installed in AM machines, new possibilities are emerging for creating digital replicas, or digital twins, of the physical parts, inline. Such digital twins can be used as a basis for qualifying parts digitally, removing the need for excess physical parts.    
In this talk we will discuss approaches for creating digital twins from inline sensor data, focussing on the problem of extracting the geometry from volumetric images. To do this we transfer techniques developed in the medical imaging domain, to the setting of AM. A digital twin is never an exact representation of the physical object or process, as there are unknowns inherent in both the dynamics of the process and in the capture of the sensor data. We therefore also investigate the use of techniques such as Kalman filters and Markov random fields to capture these uncertainties in the digital twin.

This has led to a better understanding of the Earth's climate, and CMIP model experiments have routinely been the basis for future climate change assessments made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).    
Along with all other aspects of the workflow for the sixth phase, CMIP6, the Earth System Documentation (ES-DOC) project manages the creation, analysis and dissemination of documentation about the computing platform used to run the various ensembles of simulations and their representative performance for the given hardware and CMIP6 model and experiment, with a dedicated eco-system of tools. The computational performance evaluation is characterised by the CPMIP Metrics, a set of measures specifically designed to capture the actual performance of Earth System Models (ESMs).    
We present an overview of the results of all present submissions by modelling groups towards CMIP6 machine and performance documentation coordinated by ES-DOC, whilst describing the challenges of collecting and communicating such information. We briefly look to the past and future with regards to the realities and importance of this task, for example thinking ahead to CMIP7.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75468' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1140)' class='star'><span class='star1140'>&star;</span></a> Leo Basov  <span id='bitlink-2023'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2023)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2023' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2023)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Modeling of Chemical Reactions in Rarefied Gas Flows by the Fokker-Planck Method</b><br />Leo Basov<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-250.html'>Efficient Numerical Frameworks for Kinetic And Related Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Flows encountered in space applications, like atmospheric reentry or thruster plume expansion and interactions, can be described by the well-known Boltzmann equation.  A common approach to numerically solve it is the Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC).  The method is very efficient for high Knudsen numbers but becomes increasingly computationally intensive when approaching the continuum limit.  In this regime the Boltzmann equation can be numerically solved using the recently proposed kinetic Fokker-Planck method which, like DSMC, relies on simulated particles to transport mass, momentum and energy through the flow domain, but does not resolve individual collisions.    
While this approach has been extended to mixtures and diatonic gases, the modeling of chemical reactions remains a research topic.  Many problems arise from the fact that properties of the reactants need to be considered to evaluate a chemical reaction.  This contradicts the Fokker-Planck approach that achieves its linear scaling in terms of particle numbers by forgoing the creation of interaction pairs.    
In this paper we propose a novel approach to model chemical reactions in Fokker-Planck which aims to conserve mass, energy and momentum while retaining the performance advantages in areas of high density.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75576' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1467)' class='star'><span class='star1467'>&star;</span></a> Radovan Bast  <span id='bitlink-2024'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2024)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2024' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2024)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>CodeRefinery: What We Learned from Teaching Software Engineering Practices to Students and Researchers in Nordics and Beyond</b><br />Radovan Bast<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-323.html'>An Update on Software Engineering for Science</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>CodeRefinery is a project which supports students and researchers across all  academic disciplines by advancing the FAIRness of research software and  development practices so that they can collaboratively develop, review,  discuss, test, share, and reuse their codes.  This initiative teaches the  software engineering practices which are needed for modern collaborative  computational research but are often missed in a traditional university  curriculum.    
Thus far, over 2000 students and researchers have been trained.  The project  currently focuses on the Nordic/Baltic countries, but aims to expand beyond  this region. CodeRefinery aims to operate as a community project with support  from academic organizations.    
In this contribution we will share our experiences and lessons learned from  developing and evolving the lesson curriculum and course format, from  organizing over 50 events and from growing a community of instructors and  research software engineers with the goal of improving software engineering  practices and thus the quality of computational research and engineering. We  will summarize which development tools and practices we have found to be  essential and offer recommendations on where to start and how to progress.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75726' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1631)' class='star'><span class='star1631'>&star;</span></a> Dmitry Batenkov  <span id='bitlink-2025'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2025)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2025' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2025)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Unlimited Sampling Meets Super-Resolution</b><br />Dmitry Batenkov<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-360.html'>Superresolution in Exponential Analysis - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Almost all physical sensors are limited by their dynamic range. This fundamental bottleneck also limits the practical utility of the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem which is at the heart of “Digital Revolution.” This is because amplitudes exceeding the dynamic range of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) result in permanent loss of information due to clipping or saturation.    
To reconcile this gap between theory and practice, we introduce a computational sensing approach—the Unlimited Sensing framework (USF)—that is based on a co-design of hardware and algorithms. On the hardware front, our work is based on a radically different  design, which allows for the ADCs to produce modulo or folded samples. On the algorithms front, we develop new, mathematically guaranteed recovery strategies.      
We show that recovering signals from modulo folded measurements is related to the super-resolution and exponential fitting problems. Thereon, we also consider the reconstruction of sparse signals from modulo samples which leads to a new twist in that one ends up into a double super-resolution problem.    
We show that our approach is empirically robust to noise and allows for recovery of signals upto 25 times modulo threshold, when working with modulo ADC hardware.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75788' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1352)' class='star'><span class='star1352'>&star;</span></a> Pau Batlle  <span id='bitlink-2026'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2026)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2026' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2026)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Decision Theoretical Uncertainty Quantification after Seeing the Data: Worst-Case Bayesian Priors and the Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off</b><br />Pau Batlle<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-298.html'>Robust Uncertainty Quantification and Inference - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>The need for robust UQ has lead to the development of uncertainty quantification techniques that identify the worst case Bayesian prior by solving two player adversarial games.

The complexity of the design of WEC farms is mainly related to the large areas that multiple devices cover and the multi-scale character of the hydrodynamics involved.   Numerical simulations completely based on high-fidelity models, like the CFD, are accurate but prohibitive in terms of computational cost. To overcome this limitation, a Galerkin Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) Reduced Order Model (ROM) is presented for a bi-fluid application.  Furthermore, for a proper, yet computationally efficient, treatment of the different dynamical features present in a WEC farm, a methodology is proposed coupling the CFD for the fluid-structure interaction around the device, and a Galerkin-free POD ROM for the wave propagation in the far-field. The significant drop in the computational cost of the numerical simulation of wave energy converter farms permitted by this versatile coupling methodology facilitates the design process.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75409' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(393)' class='star'><span class='star393'>&star;</span></a> Lena Baumann  <span id='bitlink-2028'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2028)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2028' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2028)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On the Dynamical Low-Rank Numerical Method for Kinetic Equations</b><br />Lena Baumann<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-87.html'>Numerics of Inverse Problems for Kinetic Models and Their Corresponding Macroscopic PDEs - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Solving inverse problems for kinetic equations requires an efficient solution of the forward problem.

This means that fixed resolution schemes will either over-resolve less complex areas or under-resolve the more complex parts. In principle, adaptively adjusting resolution provides a remedy. However, it can be computationally expensive since it requires the estimation of local errors and often costly bookkeeping of the discretization data structure. We present here temporal adaptivity based on an embedded version of spectral deferred corrections (SDC), which estimates the local error similarly to embedded Runge-Kutta methods. We are able to estimate the local error without additional right-hand-side evaluations and provide dynamic temporal resolution within the pySDC software framework. In addition, we show how adaptivity enables other improvements like fault-tolerant time-stepping.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75653' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(22)' class='star'><span class='star22'>&star;</span></a> Niklas Baumgarten  <span id='bitlink-2030'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2030)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2030' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2030)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Fully Parallelized and Budgeted Multilevel Monte Carlo (BMLMC) Method Applied to Wave Equations</b><br />Niklas Baumgarten<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-5.html'>Advanced UQ with Challenging Models - Software and Methods - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Multilevel Monte Carlo methods (MLMC) have been successfully applied to many problems by numerous authors.

This non-smooth regularizer requires an advanced algorithm to be used in (inverse) shape optimization problems. A split Bregman/ADMM method is used for this purpose. There, the non-smooth objective is spitted into a smooth shape optimization problem and a simple non-smooth problem.    
The smooth shape problem is solved by a globalized Newton method. Due to the nature of the regularizer, the first and second-order shape ?derivatives can not be computed by algorithmic differentiation. Therefore, their analytic form is derived and some of their properties are discussed.

Our method adopts a hierarchy with its levels defined by a geometrically decreasing sequence of error tolerances; in contrast to standard multilevel methods, where a hierarchy is chosen based on mesh-element or time-stepping sizes. We use isoparametric d-linear quadrilateral finite element approximations. Consider a fixed error tolerance: for each realization of the random coefficient, we select an associated mesh from a sequence of deterministic, non-uniform auxiliary meshes determined by a goal-oriented adaptive algorithm based on a dual-weighted residual error representation.    
We demonstrate our approach for a random elliptic PDE problem with a geometric singularity similar to that at the tip of a slit modeling a crack.  The source of randomness is a lognormal coefficient field, based on a Fourier expansion with random coefficients. Our adaptive approach performs well for the lognormal case treated here, despite the lack of uniform coercivity that cause functional outputs to vary over orders of magnitude between outcomes.

The issue is that registering high-intensity projections that exceed the dynamic range of the detector cause sensor saturation. While existing methods typically rely on the fusion of multiple exposures, we propose a one-shot computational imaging solution based on the novel Modulo Radon Transform (MRT). The MRT generalizes the conventional Radon Transform and is obtained via computing modulo of the line integral of a two-dimensional function at a given angle. In this way, the MRT encodes folded Radon projections and avoids information loss arising from saturation or clipping effects.    
In this talk, we rigorously introduce the Modulo Radon Transform and propose a sequential reconstruction algorithm for finitely many Modulo Radon projections, which is backed by mathematical guarantees. Our recovery strategy makes use of a property we call compact $\lambda$-exceedance, which is motivated by practice; in applications the object to be recovered is of finite extent and the measured quantity has approximately compact support. Our theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, where we report the reconstruction of target functions with Radon projections 1000-times larger in amplitude than the assumed modulo threshold.

In numerical representations those processes acting below a resolvable spatial scale are often parameterized by averaging their effect over grid cells. However, such processes may exhibit spatial structures that alter the large scale behavior in a non-uniform manner such that averaging approaches are not suitable. Multiscale Finite Elements (MsFEM) address this shortcoming of traditional parameterization approaches and have been successful in stationary or quasi-stationary settings. We present a semi-Lagrangian reconstruction method to derive a MsFEM method for transient (transport-dominated) flow problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75568' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1976)' class='star'><span class='star1976'>&star;</span></a> J&#246;rn Behrens  <span id='bitlink-2041'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2041)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2041' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2041)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Mid-Career Scientist Panel: From Doing to Leading</b><br />J&#246;rn Behrens, Donna Calhoun, Anshu Dubey<br />Thursday, March 2 11:30 AM&ndash;1:00 PM<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77137' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1512)' class='star'><span class='star1512'>&star;</span></a> Costas Bekas  <span id='bitlink-2042'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2042)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2042' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2042)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Computational Science and Engineering in Capital Markets</b><br />Costas Bekas<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-333.html'>Career Opportunities in Computational Science and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>The rapid change of markets to electronic operation has been rapidly opening opportunities for massive data analytics and computation to play a key role.

In this work, we show that the idea of compressing information into geometric symbols is not only computationally feasible with artificial neural networks, but also that it allows for learning effective and interpretable neural representations. Kendall shape VAEs can learn shapes that are translation, rotation, and scale invariant in an unsupervised manner. We qualitatively inspect the learned symbols and observe that they consistently represent classes of images that are equivalent by group actions and semantic meaning. In a quantitative comparison to other types of VAEs, we show that Kendall shape VAEs are more efficient in learning compressed representations and that the learned representations convey more information for downstream tasks such as classification.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75724' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1578)' class='star'><span class='star1578'>&star;</span></a> James F.

The ExaAM challenge problem is based on the NIST AMBench experimental builds and further characterization. These experiments both guide the model development and provide validation for the simulations. The project includes an integration of all the computational components of the AM process, where each component itself is an exascale simulation. What has emerged is that Exascale Computing will enable AM process modeling at the fidelity of the microstructure. This means tight coupling of Process-Structure-Property calculations. Macroscopic continuum codes (OpenFOAM) are used to simulation the metal melt-refreeze, within which mesoscopic codes (ExaCA, PFM) are used to simulate the development of material microstructure. This microstructure is then used by crystal plasticity codes (ExaConstit) to calculate local material properties. We present our coupled exascale simulation environment for additive manufacturing and its application to AM builds.

A key feature of these problems is that the dynamics occurs on nanometer to micrometer scales.  At those scales, thermal fluctuations play an important role in the overall dynamics and are expected to have significant impact on overall behavior of the system, particularly for problems such as those discussed above that are far from equilibrium. Here, we introduce a model for multiphase, multicomponent mixtures based on an N-component form of the Flory-Huggins extension to regular solution theory.  The thermodynamics of the system is described by a free energy that includes entropy and enthalpy of mixing as well as non-local terms representing interfacial tension.  The multiphase model is incorporated into a fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) model for nonideal liquid mixtures.  The FHD model represents thermal fluctuations by adding stochastic flux terms to both the species transport and momentum equations based on a model originally proposed  Landau and Lifshitz.  The presentation will discuss the basic formulation of the model and sketch the derivation of the equations of motion.  Numerical results will be presented validating the model and illustrating the range of phenomena that it can represent. Finally, we will show how fluctuations shift the stability region Rayleigh-Plateau instability that describes the breakup of fluid threads.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75538' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(116)' class='star'><span class='star116'>&star;</span></a> Renato Bellotti  <span id='bitlink-2047'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2047)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2047' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2047)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Novel Flexible Treatment Planning Framework for Proton Radiotherapy Using Julia and Automatic Differentiation</b><br />Renato Bellotti<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-24.html'>Research Software Engineering with Julia - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>Radiotherapy aims to cure or improve the quality of life of cancer patients by depositing a precise amount of radiation dose within the tumour while depositing only a minimal dose to the surrounding healthy tissue. The dose distribution is shaped during treatment planning, which is currently a semi-automatic process requiring human planners with years of training and experience. State of the art planning systems provide tools to automate and optimise the treatment planning, but they are inflexible, which makes it hard to incorporate advances and insights from disciplines like machine learning.  We develop a novel treatment planning framework in the Julia programming language. All our computations are performed on graphics processing units, reducing the planning time even further. This allows researchers to write codes that execute quickly, facilitating the transition from research to the clinic. The new planning framework is designed to optimise many quantities simultaneously thanks to the state-of-the art automatic differentiation libraries available in the Julia ecosystem. We adopt a flexible loss-function approach that enables a precise formulation of the treatment goals. The loss function can trivially be extended to include new insights and requirements in a short time, rendering the framework versatile and future-proof.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75232' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1580)' class='star'><span class='star1580'>&star;</span></a> Matt Bement  <span id='bitlink-2048'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2048)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2048' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2048)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Parallel-in-Time Approach to Part-Scale Melt Pool Modeling of Metal Additive Manufacturing</b><br />Matt Bement<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-349.html'>Advances in Computational Modeling  for Additive Manufacturing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>One of the primary challenges in simulating an additive manufacturing process such as laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) for an entire component is the drastically varying length and time scales.  As a consequence, the number of time steps required for a high fidelity LPBF process simulation of an entire component can easily reach into the billions, which is impractical with typical simulation codes. We present a computationally scalable approach to simulating the LPBF process for an entire component. This scalability is achieved by parallelizing the time domain integration using an iterative technique.  The proposed technique offers a path to whole component simulation of the nonlinear heat transfer and phase change that occurs in the LPBF process.

The thermo-viscoplastic reaction occurring during the building process is dynamically intense and open to several issues. Many parameters come into play to control the quality of the designed material. Each one has its specific sensitivity to the final mechanical properties of the material and therefore needs to be adjusted. Using numerical simulation to analyze these models helps get a better understanding of the sensitivity of each parameter and its effect on the quality of the final material. However, the computational cost of these simulations is demanding in terms of time and resources. This work investigates the application of Model Order Reduction (MOR) to the thermal process of SLM. A hyper-reduction strategy, relying on the Energy Conserving Sampling and Weighting method, is presented before being implemented within an adaptative POD-Greedy algorithm to build a more general reduced order base composed of versatile thermal modes. To this end, an a posteriori error estimator is used alongside Ordinary Kriging to evaluate the degree of error committed during the parametrized-MOR process.

The talk will give an overview of a geometric framework for mapping fields between meshes, which preserves certain desirable mathematical properties as the fields are mapped. Only changes of resolution in the horizontal grid are considered, and the meshes are limited to cases in which the cells of the finer mesh are exactly nested within the cells of the coarser mesh.    
Key to the design of LFRic is the PSyclone code generation system.

This extension allows the use of summation-by-parts discretizations in curvilinear coordinates with non-polynomial geometry representations, including non-uniform rational basis splines, and general nodal distributions while still satisfying the discrete metric invariants. Furthermore, we provide a thorough comparison of this optimized approach to various standard approaches of calculating different geometric terms, including the grid metric terms, metric Jacobians, and boundary normals. In the context of diagonal-norm summation-by-parts discretizations, we demonstrate through both theoretical arguments and numerical examples involving the 3D Euler equations that the optimized approach can be beneficial in certain cases. In particular, when nodal distributions that do not include boundary nodes are used, only the optimized approach results in conservative discretizations that satisfy the metric invariants and superconvergent functionals in the presence of flow tangency boundary conditions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75459' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(925)' class='star'><span class='star925'>&star;</span></a> Luca Bergamaschi  <span id='bitlink-2053'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2053)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2053' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2053)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Parallel-In-Time Solver for the All-At-Once Runge-Kutta Discretization</b><br />Luca Bergamaschi<br />Monday, February 27 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-202.html'>Modern Solvers for the Helmholtz and Wave Equations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>Time-dependent PDEs arise quite often in many scientific areas, such as mechanics, biology, economics, or chemistry. Of late, researchers have devoted their effort in devising parallel-in-time methods for the numerical solution of such PDEs, adding a new dimension of parallelism and allowing to speed-up the solution process on modern supercomputers.    
In this talk, we present a fully parallelizable preconditioner for the all-at-once linear system arising when employing a Runge-Kutta (RK) method in time. The resulting system is solved iteratively for the numerical solution and for the stages. The proposed preconditioner results in a block-diagonal solve for the stages, accelerated by a novel block-preconditioner based on the SVD of the RK coefficient matrix, and a Schur complement obtained by  solving again systems for the stages.     
Preliminary parallel results on the heat equation show the robustness of the preconditioner with respect to the discretization parameters and to the number of stages, as well as very promising scalability and parallel efficiency indices.

The so-called boundary expressions for shape directional derivatives turn out to be exact for fictitious-domain methods. However, when mesh deformations are used, only the more cumbersome volume expressions turn out to be exact. Recent numerical experiences using CutFEM together with level-set geometry descriptions indicate less parameterization-induced artificial stiffness along boundaries compared to previously used methods. Rerunning previous optimization studies with the new method led to the discovery of unexpected but acoustically very beneficial subwavelength patterns when optimizing acoustic horns. In a 3D application, an analogous CutFEM approach was used to optimize the shape of the phase plug of a compression driver, the standard sound source of acoustic horns. The optimization used a base design that currently is assumed to be unpractical, due to the lack of simple design guidelines. However, after shape optimization, it turned out that this base design very well may be superior to the industry standard design.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75281' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(843)' class='star'><span class='star843'>&star;</span></a> Jules Berman  <span id='bitlink-2056'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2056)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2056' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2056)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Low-Dimensional Models with Nonlinear Parametrizations for Systems of Transport-Dominated Evolution Equations</b><br />Jules Berman<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-184.html'>Scientific Machine Learning to Enable Outer Loop Analysis - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Latent dynamics of transport-dominated evolution phenomena such as described by hyperbolic conservation laws typically exhibit nonlinear structures that make traditional linear dimensionality reduction methods in low-dimensional subspaces inefficient. In this presentation, we build on Dirac-Frenkel variational methods to propagate forward in time nonlinear parametrizations such as deep neural networks that efficiently describe the latent dynamics of transport-dominated problems. The key contribution is an extension of previous work to handle systems of equations. Each variable, e.g., pressure and velocity, is described by a separate nonlinear parameterization, which are subsequently coupled together. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach requires few degrees of freedom to accurately describe and predict transport-dominated dynamics.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75486' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1356)' class='star'><span class='star1356'>&star;</span></a> David E.

With roughly 1,000 participants involved in the ECP, it was immediately clear that the small IDEAS project team could not provide direct hands-on support for all of the software development efforts in the ECP.  A major portion of IDEAS effort, therefore, goes into outreach activities, aimed at (1) raising the level of awareness and discussion of software-related issues in the community, (2) providing seminars and training to help developers improve their skills, (3) an online portal for the exchange of information and resources  on scientific software development, and (4) a fellowship program to help bring new voices and new ideas to the scientific software community.

In general the ODE systems are mutually coupled, implying a characteristic depends on both the other characteristic and on the solution of the PDE.    We applied the MOC to the 2D hyperbolic Monge-Ampère equation using the x-coordinate as parametrization. The solution evolves along the characteristics and henceforth the number, type and location of the necessary boundary conditions (implicitly) depends on the characteristics over the entire domain. A criterion for the boundary conditions is formulated.  Based on the coupled systems of ODEs we formulate a numerical solution method. We employ explicit one-step methods (Euler, Runge-Kutta) to integrate the ODEs systems. Subsequently, we apply B-spline interpolation along vertical grid lines to approximate the solution in grid points. Using an adaptive integration step we bound the errors of the interpolation. Subsequently, the order of accuracy of the numerical scheme is known and stability of the scheme is obtained.   The scheme attains the theoretical order of convergence and converges to computer precision for multiple examples. Moreover, the numerical method is able to handle complicated cases with shocks  in- and varying numbers of boundary conditions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75440' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(801)' class='star'><span class='star801'>&star;</span></a> Fleurianne Bertrand  <span id='bitlink-2059'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2059)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2059' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2059)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Contact Problems in Porous Media</b><br />Fleurianne Bertrand<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-175.html'>Reliable and Efficient Methods for Coupled Problems in Porous Media - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we consider a Biot contact problem, i.e. Biot equations with Signorini contact conditions.

However, programming for the GPU remains a difficult task, and optimising for a specific vendor/model is harder still. Using Firedrake we can remove much of this difficulty by using automatic code generation and targeting the GPU directly, which allows users to utilise accelerators for their PDE simulations.    
For most projects a "rewrite for GPUs" or a "GPU version" can be created, this is not the case for Firedrake. We create a pathway for automatically generating GPU code for any PDE a user can input, as well as maintaining all existing CPU functionality. By not completely rewriting the codebase we demonstrate the power of the code generation approach.    
We present the early progress made in offloading Firedrake’s functionality on to accelerators. The main focus is on adding GPU assembly for one-forms to enable matrix free operator evaluation and enabling GPU based solvers. We will demonstrate the functionality within Firedrake to optimise for GPUs specifically and how to minimise host to device transfers. These changes utilise the GPU support within loo.py and PETSc to produce efficient and scalable simulations. Some early results are included that show some of the preliminary functionality for GPU platforms.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75322' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1678)' class='star'><span class='star1678'>&star;</span></a> Amneet P.S.

Most commonly, the VP method is used to solve FSI problems, although it has also been used to solve scalar advection-diffusion PDEs. The original VP technique was inspired by Brinkman's work and treats solids embedded in a fluid as porous media. The velocity boundary condition on the fluid-solid interface, which is of Dirichlet type, is imposed through a volumetric feedback force that is inversely proportional to the penalty parameter $\kappa$. Since both fluids and solids are represented on a single Eulerian grid, the VP method can be implemented in parallel codes much more easily than the dual grid (Lagrangian-Eulerian) IB method.       
VP method research has largely focused on understanding the accuracy of the penalized Dirichlet solution. There is a little research on (1) developing efficient solvers for the volume penalized fluid solvers, especially when the system becomes stiff as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$; and (2) imposing spatially varying Neumann and Robin boundary conditions on geometrically complex interfaces. In this talk we discuss recent advances in the VP method that address both of these issues.      </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75810' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1437)' class='star'><span class='star1437'>&star;</span></a> Pawan Bharadwaj  <span id='bitlink-2065'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2065)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2065' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2065)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Disentangling Nuisance Factors During Geophysical Inversion Using Symmetric Autoencoders</b><br />Pawan Bharadwaj<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-317.html'>Computational Methods for Inverse Problems with Nuisance Parameters</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>We present an autoencoder architecture that assumes scale separation to represent the measurements of a given physical system using two separate latent codes: one correlated with the information that varies on a slow scale and another one on a much faster scale. The key idea is that, as opposed to using the underlying physical model, the architecture uses symmetry and stochastic regularization to achieve a data-driven disentanglement. We show that this disentanglement is invaluable when analyzing geophysical systems. Here, the variations in the measurements occur across two separate scales attached to different physical phenomena, with one of the phenomena being task-irrelevant and therefore resulting in nuisance parameters. Some examples include passive time-lapse seismic monitoring using measurements corrupted with nuisance variations due to uncontrollable sources; learning earthquake signatures in the presence of nuisances attached to multiple scattering in the subsurface; leveraging symmetry under reordering the pixels to disentangle the influence of the nuisance atmosphere effects from hyperspectral imagery.

We extend two algorithms based on statistical leverage-score sampling to the distributed-memory setting, where processor-to-processor communication overhead is a major obstacle to achieving the speedup enjoyed in a shared-memory system. We investigate multiple strategies to combat this problem by adapting techniques from distributed sparse matrix algorithms and produce high-performance implementations of these algorithms.

No assumptions are made on the structure of the statistical model or the prior distribution while constructing the estimator. The estimator has the following notable advantages: first, no controlled experiment or data is required to conduct the practical identifiability analysis; second, different forms of uncertainties, such as model-form, parameter, or measurement can be taken into account; third, the identifiability analysis is global, rather than being restricted to a local region of the parameter space. If an individual parameter is unidentifiable, it can belong to an identifiable subset such that parameters within the subset have a functional relationship with one another and thus have a combined effect on the statistical model.  The practical identifiability framework is extended to highlight the dependencies between parameter pairs that emerge a posteriori, with the goal of finding identifiable parameter subsets.  The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a linear Gaussian model and a non-linear methane-air reduced kinetics model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75486' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(186)' class='star'><span class='star186'>&star;</span></a> Katharina Bieker  <span id='bitlink-2068'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2068)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2068' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2068)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Data-Driven Control Using Autonomous Surrogate Models</b><br />Katharina Bieker<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-41.html'>Advances in Optimal Control and Shape Optimization Concerning Applications in Physics and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of machine learning and data-based methods, including the modeling of dynamical systems with the help of data-based surrogate models. These methods have also found their way into the field of control engineering, especially in model predictive control. However, compared to the creation of surrogate models for autonomous models (without control input), the building of data-based models for controlled systems is typically much more difficult and data hungry. To address these issues, in this talk, we present a framework which is based on a discretization of the control inputs such that modeling techniques for autonomous systems can be used without adaptations. As a result, the modeling effort and also the amount of required data can be reduced. Relaxation and rounding techniques from the area of mixed-integer control are then used to solve the newly derived discrete control problem. We verify the presented approach with various examples where we use different techniques to build the data-based models.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75257' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(433)' class='star'><span class='star433'>&star;</span></a> Daniel R.

While the QR factorization with Column Pivoting (QRCP) offers a robust solution, it suffers from scaling issues due to its communication-bound nature. The Pivoting Avoiding QR factorization (PAQR) is an alternative that benefits from a scaling similar to that of the original QR factorization but at the expense of fewer theoretical guarantees compared to QRCP. We show how the application in different precisions aids in retaining the speed of a traditional QR factorization, while still selecting an appropriate column order. Within PAQR, there exists a tolerance parameter (used to detect any possible deficiency) that influences the algorithm's behavior, this parameter can be selected so as to fit the accuracy of FP32 or FP16 arithmetic. In this talk we investigate the use of lower-precisions and mixed precisions using PAQR in the context of deficient least-squares problems.

These offer a broad range of computational building blocks, optimized for different aspects such as computing platform, problem size, precision, and matrix properties. However, in spite of the quality of such libraries, we observe that end users are increasingly less likely to use them, at least directly. In fact, realistic workflows are significantly more complex than the functionality of the kernels offered in such libraries, and the intelligent decomposition of a workflow in terms of a set of available kernels is in itself a challenging task. We refer to this task as "Linear Algebra Mapping Problem" (LAMP). In practice, the problem is often circumvented by adopting high-level languages such as Matlab, Python, and R, or C++ (in combination with libraries such as Armadillo or Eigen), which offer a convenient high-level syntax for matrix computations, thus boosting user productivity; by contrast, these languages are still immature with respect to the solution of the LAMP, and in terms of performance they suffer from vastly suboptimal choices. In a nutshell: High-performance libraries are a necessary, but not sufficient component for high-performance matrix computations.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75564' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1587)' class='star'><span class='star1587'>&star;</span></a> Rutger Biezemans  <span id='bitlink-2071'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2071)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2071' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2071)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Non-Intrusive Implementation of Multiscale Finite Element Methods</b><br />Rutger Biezemans<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-351.html'>Computational Approaches for Multiscale Problems and Their Applications</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>The multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) is a finite element method (FEM) that allows to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with highly oscillatory coefficients on a coarse mesh, i.e. a mesh with elements of size much larger than the characteristic scale of the heterogeneities. To do so, MsFEMs use pre-computed basis functions, adapted to the differential operator, thereby taking into account the small scales of the problem.     
Standard FEM software is based on problem-independent (e.g. polynomial) basis functions, so that the resolution of the FEM can be automated for a large variety of problems. Such software cannot easily be adapted to deal with specific basis functions for each new problem; the MsFEM approach is intrusive. In this talk, we shall propose adaptations of the MsFEM that allow for a non-intrusive approximation strategy: our MsFEM leads to an effective PDE with slowly varying coefficients, hence can be solved by means of standard FEM software. We hope this will facilitate the implementation of the MsFEM outside academic environments.

These coils need to satisfy strict engineering tolerances, and if those are not met the project could be canceled as in the case of the National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) project. Therefore, our goal is to find coil configurations that increase construction tolerances without compromising the performance of the magnetic field. In this paper, we develop a gradient-based stochastic optimization model which seeks robust stellarator coil configurations in high dimensions. In particular, we design a two-step method: first, we perform an approximate global search by a sample efficient trust-region Bayesian optimization; second, we refine the minima found in step one with a stochastic local optimizer. To this end, we introduce two stochastic local optimizers: BFGS applied to the Sample Average Approximation and Adam, equipped with a control variate for variance reduction. Numerical experiments performed on a W7-X-like coil configuration demonstrate that our global optimization approach finds a variety of promising local solutions at less than 0.1% of the cost of previous work, which considered solely local stochastic optimization.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75229' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(732)' class='star'><span class='star732'>&star;</span></a> Mickael Binois  <span id='bitlink-2073'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2073)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2073' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2073)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Massively Parallel Bayesian Optimization</b><br />Mickael Binois<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-161.html'>Theory and Applications of Derivative-Free Optimization - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>One way to reduce the time of conducting optimization studies is to evaluate designs in parallel rather than just one-at-a-time.  For expensive-to-evaluate black-boxes, batch versions of Bayesian optimization have been proposed.   They work by building a surrogate model of the black-box that can be used to select the designs to evaluate efficiently via an infill criterion.  Still, with higher levels of parallelization becoming available, the strategies that work for a few tens of parallel evaluations become limiting, in particular due to the complexity of selecting more evaluations. It is even more crucial when the black-box is noisy, necessitating more evaluations as well as repeating experiments.  Here we propose a scalable strategy that can keep up with massive batching natively, focused on the exploration/exploitation trade-off and a portfolio allocation.   We compare the approach with related methods on noisy test functions. The results show similar or better performance than existing methods, while being orders of magnitude faster. Then we illustrate the potential on the optimization of a large-scale epidemiological simulator.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75456' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(551)' class='star'><span class='star551'>&star;</span></a> Philipp Birken  <span id='bitlink-2074'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2074)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2074' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2074)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Conservative Iterative Solvers for Systems of Conservation Laws</b><br />Philipp Birken<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-120.html'>Structure-Preserving Time-Stepping Methods for Differential Equations</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>We consider implicit discretizations for systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. A successful design principle for such discretizations has been to respect conservation. Iterative methods are typically not designed based on such ideas.     
The question thus arises if iterative methods are locally conservative. As it turns out, many commonly used methods preserve the local conservation of an underlying implicit scheme. This includes pseudo-time iterations, Newton's method and Krylov subspace methods. However, there are prominent exceptions, in particular the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterations.    
We present extensions of the Lax-Wendroff theorem for a fixed, finite number of iterations each time step. The iterative method defines a numerical flux that is inconsistent in general. We can describe the specific inconsistency as a form of slowed down time for pseudo-time iterations, Krylov methods, and thereby also Newton-Krylov methods. A simple technique based on the explicit Euler method can alleviate flux-inconsistency and can additionally be used to generate improved initial guesses for iterative methods. Numerical experiments illustrate the theory.

We present results in which GrainNN can be orders of magnitude faster than phase field simulations, while delivering 5%–15% pointwise error. This speedup includes the cost of the phase field simulations for generating training data.

In several contexts, they are solved numerically by the finite difference (FD) method. When modelling real-world phenomena, these methods are complex to derive, implement and computationally expensive. We present Devito, an open-source framework written in Python that addresses these issues.  Devito consists of a domain-specific language to express PDEs symbolically via FD and a compiler capable of lowering symbolic expressions into highly efficient kernels for a variety of architectures. Thanks to its multi-layer architecture, Devito promotes interdisciplinary research and development. Time-consuming, error-prone and handwritten code practices are mitigated: (i) problem modelling, (ii) implementation of stencils and their adjoints, boundary conditions, sparse operations, and other PDE operators, (iii) performance optimisations (e.g., tiling and FLOPs reduction) and (iv) support for vectorisation, shared- and distributed-memory parallelism, GPUs.  Devito has been used successfully in academia and industry for several years, especially in the context of wave modelling in anisotropic media for seismic inversion, delivering competitive performance while drastically reducing complexity.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75322' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(548)' class='star'><span class='star548'>&star;</span></a> Abhijit Biswas  <span id='bitlink-2077'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2077)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2077' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2077)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multiple Invariants-Preserving Relaxation Runge Kutta Methods for Conservative Dynamical Systems</b><br />Abhijit Biswas<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-120.html'>Structure-Preserving Time-Stepping Methods for Differential Equations</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>Relaxation Runge-Kutta methods, which are a slight modification of the RK methods, have been introduced to preserve invariants of initial-value problems.

It brings maternal and fetal blood close together, allowing nutrients to diffuse across thin separating barriers in the fetal villous tree structure. Structurally, the placenta is divided into placentones: compartments that are partially separated by septal walls.    
An approach to modelling maternal blood flow is to treat the fetal villous tree as a porous medium; several authors have utilised this on representative placentone geometries, mainly focusing on arterial supply. However, whilst these simulations are a useful indicator of organ-level behaviour, they fail to describe the effects of the blood flux between neighbouring placentones, as well as neglecting the importance of maternal venous return. In 2020, a new phenomenon was discovered called the placental contraction, which is yet to be mathematically modelled.     
I will present some in-silico organ-scale maternal blood flow simulations, using Navier-Stokes and Brinkman equations to model blood flow on representative placental geometries, coupled to a reaction-advection-diffusion equation to model nutrient transport. I will show notable blood flux passing between placentones, the importance of considering maternal venous return paths on the uniformity of oxygen exchange, and that the recently-observed placental contraction phenomenon could be vital in redistributing blood and encouraging venous return.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75845' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(397)' class='star'><span class='star397'>&star;</span></a> Alain Blaustein  <span id='bitlink-2079'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2079)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2079' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2079)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Discrete Framework for Hypocoercivity Methods in the Context of Kinetic Equations</b><br />Alain Blaustein<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-88.html'>Numerics of Inverse Problems for Kinetic Models and Their Corresponding Macroscopic PDEs - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>We propose a numerical method for a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck model with external applied force field and prove quantitative results ensuring that it is Asymptotic-Preserving for  both the macroscopic regime and the long time behavior simultaneously.

However, advection-dominated problems are difficult to tackle this way.   In their work Nonlinear model reduction on metric spaces, Ehrlacher et al. (2020) consider PDE solutions as elements of the $L^2$-Wasserstein space. Distributions are expressed as weighted means (in the sense of the Wasserstein distance) of a select few reference elements.   Using Linear Optimal Transportation (also known as Monge Embeddings), we extend this approach to more than one spatial dimension. In LOT, a distribution $\mu$ is mapped to the optimal transport map $T_{\sigma \rightarrow \mu}$ that takes a fixed reference distribution $\sigma$ to $\mu$. While the set of solutions $\{ \mu_i \}_{i=1,2,\dots}$ typically exhibits slow n-width decay, that of the set of maps $\{ T_{\sigma \rightarrow \mu_i} \}_{i=1,2,\dots}$ is much faster. This allows us to find a low-dimensional approximation of transport maps, which are elements of a linear space.   Since reconstruction of a solution via these reduced maps is not exact, we can improve the approximation by using a reduced basis in the reference domain. This leads to a method in the spirit of snapshot remapping that is illustrated with numerical examples.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75309' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1608)' class='star'><span class='star1608'>&star;</span></a> Maarten Blommaert  <span id='bitlink-2082'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2082)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2082' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2082)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Algorithmic Challenges in Topology Optimization of District Heating Networks</b><br />Maarten Blommaert<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-355.html'>New Developments in Shape, Topology and Tubular Optimization - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>District heating networks have the potential to decarbonize heat supply. By designing them for low supply temperatures, the potential of renewables and waste heat can be fully exploited. The high investment costs, however, hamper their wide implementation. Over the last decades, several attempts have been made to directly optimize the network topology for maximal return on investment. Most of these studies successfully apply mixed-integer linear or nonlinear programming methods to decide on the optimal piping connections in the network. However, while the linear methods are limited in applicability, the nonlinear methods suffer from an exponential computational cost scaling with the network size.     
In this contribution, we present how adjoint-based topology optimization methods can be adopted for the topology optimization of district heating networks. We describe the key steps to adapt density-based topology optimization methods to achieve discrete solutions for the diameters of the heating pipes. Using an augmented Lagrangian method, large amounts of engineering constraints are efficiently accounted for in the design. Moreover, a benchmark with a mixed-integer nonlinear programming method confirms the advantageous scaling of the presented topology optimization method. Thus, we are able to showcase first topology optimization results for large-scale district heating networks.

In the first part of the entry trajectory, the flow is highly rarefied, and convection and surface interaction dominate over particle collisions. Macroscopically, one observes a diffuse shock in front of the body and a very-low density shadow behind it. In both these regions, the gas is out of thermodynamic (translational) equilibrium, and the particle velocity distribution function deviates from the Maxwellian distribution. Traditional fluid methods such as the Euler and the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations are unable to reproduce these situations accurately.   In this work, we investigate the application of maximum-entropy moment methods to this problem, considering the 10 and 14-moment systems. These methods consist in a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations, that extend the validity of the NSF equations to strongly non-equilibrium conditions. We analyze the accuracy of the maximum-entropy solutions and the associated computational cost, that depends on the trajectory of the solution in moment space. A BGK collision model is employed for simplicity. Maximum-entropy results are compared to a particle-based solution of the kinetic equation.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75513' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1988)' class='star'><span class='star1988'>&star;</span></a> Alberto Bocchinfuso  <span id='bitlink-2085'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2085)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2085' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2085)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Particle Filtering Method for Estimating Cell Membrane Permeability from Surface PH Data</b><br />Alberto Bocchinfuso<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-410.html'>Models and Software for Multiscale Computational Chemistry</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>The transport of gases through cell membranes is one of the fundamental processes for oxygen-based life forms.

Accordingly, the first step of traditional ML techniques includes data preprocessing, information extraction, and dimension reduction. This can be done manually via feature engineering or automatically via representation learning. There is a trade-off between these two approaches, which is to say, utilizing domain knowledge and promoting handcrafted features results in suboptimal performance, whereas learning representations directly from the data increases the performance, but also reduces the interpretability of the ML algorithms.     
In this talk, we propose VPNet, a novel model-driven neural network architecture by combining variable projections (VPs) and neural networks (NNs). VP is a classical method for solving separable nonlinear least squares problems (SNLLSs) by which we extract features automatically in our learning framework. Note that many inverse problems can be viewed as SNLLS data fitting problems including a small set of adjustable nonlinear parameters with direct physical interpretations.  Thus, VPNet retains the powerful learning ability of ML methods, and the representation abilities of VPs in which both the trainable parameters and the extracted features are interpretable. As a case study, we show the potential of VPNet in road surface classification, which is an important environmental recognition problem in autonomous driving.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75427' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1899)' class='star'><span class='star1899'>&star;</span></a> Fabian B&#246;hm  <span id='bitlink-2088'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2088)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2088' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2088)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Co-Design of Discretizations and Matrix-Free Solvers for Large-Scale Stokes Problems with Extreme Viscosity Variations</b><br />Fabian B&#246;hm<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(808)' class='star'><span class='star808'>&star;</span></a> Diogo Bolster  <span id='bitlink-2089'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2089)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2089' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2089)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Simulation of Mixing and Reactions in a Full Size Porous Column Using a Hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian Approach</b><br />Diogo Bolster<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-176.html'>Reliable and Efficient Methods for Coupled Problems in Porous Media - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>We perform the largest and most highly resolved simulation to date of solute transport through a laboratory scale porous medium column.

IN particular we are able to study the influence of boundary effects, which are typically neglected in current interpretations and develop rigorous theories that enable a more accurate interpretation of what is actually happening with the end goal of developing improved upscaled models that account for the full range of complexities that any real experiment will have. Additionally we have developed novel approaches for interface tracking through the porous column that provide an unprecedented view of mixing processes that are key to understanding and ultimately predicting mixing-driven reactions where current predictions either overestimate the amount of reaction or artificially and unphysical adjust reaction parameters to match observations, but at the cost of loss of generalization to other settings.

Developers of simulation codes and numerical methods are confronted not just with a tremendous amount of parallelism but also with a high degree of heterogeneity, hierarchies in networking and memory and challenging programming models. To face these problems we focus on algebraic multigrid methods for structured matrices. In these we use the level hierarchy naturally present in the system matrices while using advanced results from numerical linear algebra to design optimal components for these matrices. The presence of structure not only allows us to obtain the hierarchy straightforwardly, it also eases the efficient implementation on modern computer architectures, including accelerators like GPUs. Nevertheless, even with efficient implementations, the methods' performance is still memory bound. Certain approaches like higher order discretization, but also techniques from linear algebra like block smoothers or polynomial smoothers, can increase the arithmetic intensity and thus reduce the effect of this memory boundedness.

They issue growth factors that are felt in nearby blood vessels and stimulate the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) that carry the needed oxygen and nutrients to the tumor. Epithelial cells in move collectively to close a wound or collectively push an epithelial monolayer of a different tissue. Aspects of these multiscale processes in biomedicine can be studied by mathematical and computational models. We discuss angiogenesis at supracellular scales by stochastic differential equations and birth-death processes, derive continuum descriptions of the density of moving blood vessels and analyse a soliton-like attractor. Numerical simulations of a cellular Potts model including Notch signaling between cells describe the growth of blood vessels at cellular and subcellular levels.    
Collective cellular motion of epithelial cells can be described using simpler active vertex models, in which cells are polygons forming a Voronoi tessellation of the tissue. The dual Delaunay triangulation comprises cells centers that evolve according to dynamics including collective inertia and active forces. Numerical simulations qualitatively agree with experiments on wound healing assays, formation of fingers, and antagonistic migration assays of a precancerous cellular aggregate invading the space of a healthy tissue and displacing its cells.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75749' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(655)' class='star'><span class='star655'>&star;</span></a> Guillaume Bonnet  <span id='bitlink-2094'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2094)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2094' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2094)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Discretization of the Second Boundary Value Problem for the Monge-Ampere Equation Using Voronoi's First Reduction</b><br />Guillaume Bonnet<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-144.html'>Monge-Ampere Equations: Numerical Methods and Applications - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>The Monge-Ampère equation belongs to the class of fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations.

In this work, we address the evaluation of the $H^{-r}(D)$ norm of a function $c\in L^2(D)$, with $r\in]1/2,1]$. To this end, the Riesz representative $u[c]\in H^r_0(D)$ of $c$ is sought, and we then have $\Vert c\Vert _{H^{-r}(D)}=(u[c],c)_{L^2(D)}$. Computing $u[c]$ by domain discretization methods (e.g. FEM) for fractional $r$ would entail either the costly accurate evaluation of sufficiently many Dirichlet Laplace eigenfunctions of $D$ or multiple elliptic problem solves. By contrast, the computational treatment proposed here rests on one volume integral operator (VIO) evaluation with density $c$ followed by solving one single-layer integral equation (SLIE) on $\partial D$ (ensuring $\gamma u[c]=0$). The kernel used in both the VIO and the SLIE depends in closed form on $r$ and the physical coordinates (and has a singularity of order $2r-d$); in fact, the VIO is directly connected with the $H^{-r}(R^d)$ Fourier-Bessel norm. We prove that the SLIE in weak form is coercive on $H^{1/2-r}(\partial D)$ for any $r\in]1/2,1]$, making it well-posed. Our procedure thus naturally extends to fractional $r$ the method solving in $H^1_0(D)$ the Poisson problem with given density $c$. We demonstrate the proposed approach on computational examples with available reference solutions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75859' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1185)' class='star'><span class='star1185'>&star;</span></a> Christophe Bonneville  <span id='bitlink-2096'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2096)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2096' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2096)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>GPLaSDI: Identifying Autoencoders Latent Space Dynamics with Gaussian Processes for Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Models</b><br />Christophe Bonneville<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-260.html'>Reduced Order Modeling of Differential Equations Through Deep Learning Algorithms - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Solving PDE numerically is challenging and computationally costly, which motivates the development of faster reduced order models (ROMs). In recent years, the advance in machine learning allows the development of novel non-linear projection methods, such as Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) [Fries W., He X., Choi Y., LaSDI: Parametric Latent Space Dynamics Identification, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering (2022)]. LaSDI maps full-order PDE solutions into a latent space using auto-encoders and learns the system of ODEs governing the latent space dynamics. Interpolating and solving the system of ODEs allows for fast ROM predictions by feeding the predicted latent dynamics into the decoder. In this talk, we present Gaussian-process-LaSDI (GPLaSDI). GPLaSDI improves LaSDI in two ways: First, it uses Gaussian processes to interpolate the coefficients of the learnt latent dynamics, which allows for quantifying the uncertainty over the ROM predictions. Second, it uses the uncertainty to pick next parameter point where additional ROM data is collected to improve accuracy. This allows us to apply GPLaSDI to problems without any known underlying governing equations, e.g., noisy experimental data. Our method can achieve up to a few thousand time speed up with minimal reliance on the full order solver, provides meaningful confidence intervals over its prediction, and does not require to know the governing PDE or have access to its residual.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75596' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1541)' class='star'><span class='star1541'>&star;</span></a> Wietse M.

Boon<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-339.html'>High Performance Computing Tools for Mixed Dimensional Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Constructing fast solution schemes often involves deciding which errors are acceptable and which approximations can be made for the sake of computational efficiency. Herein, we consider a mixed formulation of Darcy flow and take the perspective that the physical law of mass conservation is significantly more important than the constitutive relationship, i.e. Darcy's law. Within this point of view, we propose a three-step solution technique that guarantees local mass conservation.    
In the first step, an initial flux field is obtained by using a locally conservative method such as the TPFA Finite Volume Method. Although this scheme is computationally efficient, it lacks consistency and therefore requires a suitable correction. Since this correction is divergence-free, the Helmholtz decomposition ensures that it is given by the curl of a potential field. The second step therefore employs an H(curl)-conforming discretization to compute the correction potential and update the flux field. The pressure field is computed in the final step by using the same TPFA system from the first step.    
The procedure guarantees local mass conservation regardless of the quality of the computed correction. Thus, we relax this computation using tools from reduced order modeling. We introduce a reduced basis method that is capable of rapidly producing a potential field for given permeability fields. By applying the curl to this field, we ensure that the correction is divergence-free and mass conservation is not impacted.    
Finally, we extend the method to solving Darcy flow in fractured porous media. We rewrite the equations in terms of mixed-dimensional differential operators and identify the problem as a mixed-dimensional Darcy flow system. In turn, the proposed three-step solution procedure directly applies using the mixed-dimensional curl to ensure local mass conservation.

The imaging function is based on the principle of time reversal in non-attenuating media and uses a data driven estimate of the internal wave originating from the vicinity of the imaging point and propagating to the sensors through the unknown medium. We explain how this estimate can be obtained using a reduced order model (ROM) for the wave propagation. We analyze the imaging function, connect it to the time reversal process and describe how its resolution depends on the aperture of the array, the bandwidth of the probing pulse and the medium through which the waves propagate.

For a penetrable object with known sound speed, this can be accomplished by treating the boundary alone as an unkown curve. Alternatively, one can treat the entire object as unknown and use a more general volumetric representation, without making use of the known sound speed. Both lead to strongly nonlinear and nonconvex optimzation problems for which recursive linearization provides a useful framework for numerical analysis. After extending our shape optimzation approach developed earlier for impenetrable bodies, we carry out a systematic study of both methods and compare their performance on a variety of examples. Our findings indicate that the volumetric approach is more robust, even though the number of degrees of freedom is significantly larger. We conclude with a discussion of this phenomenon and potential directions for furhter research.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75579' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1801)' class='star'><span class='star1801'>&star;</span></a> Robin Bornoff  <span id='bitlink-2100'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2100)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2100' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2100)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Software Implications from Obfuscated Thermo-Mechanical Reduced Order Models of Packaged Semiconductor Devices</b><br />Robin Bornoff<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-396.html'>Model Order Reduction of Multiphysical Finite Element Models in Microelectronics</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75874' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1684)' class='star'><span class='star1684'>&star;</span></a> Anne M.

In this contribution, we present a new phase-field model for adhesion and discuss its underlying foundations in terms of thermomechanical consistency. The interaction between adhesive interfaces is modelled by the introduction of a coupling term in the classical free energy. The resulting phase-field model is a stiff, higher-order, non-linear partial differential equation, in which adhesive interaction is regularized onto the moving interfaces.    
We characterize the singular limit of the adhesion problem. Under the assumption of the existence of a smooth limiting interface, we identify the limiting sharp-interface energy of our adhesion problem and demonstrate that its minimisers are geometric surfaces with a non-trivial adhered part.    
Lastly, we provide numerical examples of adhesion and show how unconditionally energy-stable results can be obtained by using the scalar auxiliary variable approach as time-discretization scheme. Furthermore, we discuss application of the presented model to problems in cell biology, which is vital in understanding numerous biological processes, including cell migration, structural integrity and signal transduction. We show how the model can be extended to account for the protein dynamics at a cell’s membrane, which govern the binding and unbinding of a cell to its extracellular environment.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75811' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1217)' class='star'><span class='star1217'>&star;</span></a> George Bosilca  <span id='bitlink-2102'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2102)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2102' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2102)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Runtime System Considerations for Approximate Computing at Scale</b><br />George Bosilca<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-267.html'>Approximate Computing for Scientific Applications - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75607' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1271)' class='star'><span class='star1271'>&star;</span></a> Ignace Bossuyt  <span id='bitlink-2103'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2103)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2103' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2103)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Numerical Study of a Micro-Macro Model-Reduced 3-Level Parareal Method for Scale-Separated SDEs</b><br />Ignace Bossuyt<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-279.html'>Advances in Time-Parallel Methods for Challenging Problems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>Time-parallel methods can reduce the wall clock time required for the accurate numerical solution of a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) by parallelizing across the time-dimension.

One of the common challenges arising in these applications is the lack of available transmission probabilities between these geographical units. Several methods have been proposed recently for solving this task. One of them is the Generalized Inverse Infection Model (GIIM) [A. Bóta, L. M. Gardner: A generalized framework for the estimation of edge infection probabilities. arXiv:1706.07532]. GIIM offers a large amount of modelling flexibility and allows transmission probabilities to be defined as a function of known attributes, or risk factors in an epidemic context. In this presentation we will see how GIIM works in two specific real-life outbreaks. The first one considers the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in the Americas [L. M. Gardner, A. Bóta, N. D. Grubaugh, K. Gangavarapu, M. U. G. Kramer: Inferring the risk factors behind the geographical spread and transmission of Zika in the Americas. PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases 12 (1), e0006194 (2018)], while he second application models the 2009 H1N1 outbreak between the municipalities of Sweden [A. Bóta, M. Holmberg, L. M. Gardner, M. Rosvall: Socio-economic and environmental patterns behind H1N1 spreading in Sweden. Scientific Reports 11 (1), 1-14, 2021.]

The framework is composed of an encoder that compresses high-dimensional measurements into low-dimensional state variables, and a latent dynamical model for the state variables that predicts the system evolution over time. The training of the proposed model is carried out in an unsupervised manner, i.e., not relying on labeled data.  Our learning method is evaluated on the motion of a pendulum -- a well studied baseline for nonlinear model identification and control with continuous states and control inputs -- measured via high-dimensional noisy RGB images. Results show that the method can effectively denoise measurements, learn compact state representations and latent dynamical models, as well as identify and quantify modeling uncertainties.

Solving Newton-like linear systems in the coarse-grid correction (CGC) step inhibits good parallel scaling, however: the non-preconditioned iterative solver requires more iterations when increasing time-parallelism. Inspired by developments for the Parareal PinT algorithm for initial-value problems, we propose using diagonalisation-based preconditioners to speed up CGC and improve scaling.     These preconditioners build upon those used in the ParaDiag class of algorithms [2], extended to support both tracking and terminal-cost objectives and having undergone improvements and convergence analyses. We formulate preconditioned ParaOpt for linear problems and demonstrate good weak scaling in numerical tests, supported theoretically by linking to our novel ParaDiag results. In addition, we lay out a clear pathway towards non-linear preconditioned ParaOpt, based on non-linear extensions of ParaDiag.      [1]: M. J. Gander, F. Kwok, and J. Salomon.

Challenges arise both in considering the appropriate model assumptions and from the viewpoint of data availability, verification, and validation. Recently, data-driven modeling approaches have been proposed that aim to establish stress-evolution laws that avoid user-chosen functional forms by relying on machine learning algorithms. However, these approaches not only require a significant amount of data but also need data that probes the full stress space and also probes a variety of complex loading paths. In this work, we discuss a hybrid framework that can work on a variable amount of data by relying on the modularity of the elastoplasticity formulation where each component of the model can be chosen to be either a classical phenomenological or a data-driven model depending on the amount of available information. The method is tested on synthetic uniaxial data coming from simulations as well as cyclic experimental data for structural materials. The discovered material models are found to not only interpolate well but also for accurate extrapolation in a thermodynamically consistent manner far outside the domain of the training data.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75276' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2)' class='star'><span class='star2'>&star;</span></a> Nicolas Boulle  <span id='bitlink-2109'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2109)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2109' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2109)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Learning Green's Functions with Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra</b><br />Nicolas Boulle<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-0.html'>Randomized Linear Algebra in Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>Can one learn a differential operator from pairs of solutions and righthand sides?

The idea is to reduce the amount of sampling by demoting the randomization to lower precision. For a tall and skinny mxn matrix,  o(n) samples produce a randomized preconditioner that is highly ill-conditioned in double precision, but much better conditioned after demotion to single precision. From a deterministic perturbation perspective, we present lower bounds for the smallest singular values that explain the singular value increase in lower precision. These are genuine lower bounds, in contrast to existing expressions which hold only to first and second order. From a probabilistic perspective, we model perturbations as independent, bounded random variables, and present expressions for the expectation of the small singular values. Numerical experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the preconditioners.

This problem is expensive to evaluate through full order finite-element (FE) models, as each chip can easily contain more than one million degrees-of-freedom. Even classical model order reduction methods struggle in this setting as reducing the full system model directly might be overly expensive. A solution to this would be to apply substructuring methods, where each chip and solder connection is reduced separately and then coupled together. However, in this case the large interfaces between the chips and solder, which leads to relatively large reduced order models.   We propose the use of an inexact substructuring approach where the interfaces are described through a penalty formulation. This inexact interface enables additional flexibility on two fronts: on the one hand we are not bound by a consistent FE discretization on matching surfaces, and on the other hand we do not need to have conforming deformation modes on the interfaces.   We exploit this framework to analyze transient thermal loads on a structural response of a PCB with multiple chips attached. We demonstrate the low computational cost of this approach obtained by the independence of the ROM size on the interface discretization, and the flexibility with which design changes can be evaluated due to the possibility of inconsistent discretizations on the interfaces.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75874' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1366)' class='star'><span class='star1366'>&star;</span></a> Cesare Bracco  <span id='bitlink-2114'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2114)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2114' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2114)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>$C^1$ Hierarchical Splines Spaces on Surface Multipatch Domains</b><br />Cesare Bracco<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-301.html'>Advances in Isogeometric Analysis on Complex Geometries - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>Adaptive isogeometric methods for the solution of PDEs have been largely investigated in recent years (see [Bracco, Buffa, Giannelli, Vàzquez, Discret. Contin. Dyn. S., 2019] for an overview). The combination of isogeometric analysis and local refinement makes them computationally attractive, and therefore it is relevant to study the extension of this approach to high-order problems on complex domains. In this work, we propose an adaptive isogeometric method for the numerical approximation of high-order PDEs based on $C^1$ hierarchical spline spaces defined on multipatch surfaces. We achieve this goal by combining the construction of $C^1$ multipatch spaces [Farahat, J\"uttler, Kapl, Takacs, Isogeometric analysis with $C^1$-smooth functions over multi-patch surfaces, Comput.

Existing approaches assume that the computational budget is sufficient to estimate the active subspace, either via gradient-based methods or using a large number of simulator evaluations. Here we tackle the more challenging (and practically relevant) case where we do not have sufficient computational budget to satisfactorily estimate the active subspace. We develop a high-dimensional Bayesian optimization approach to solve the Randomized Maximum Likelihood (RML) problem. RML is an approximate posterior sampling methodology based on multi-objective optimization, first developed for petroleum engineering applications. By sharing data between the different objective functions, we are able to implement RML at a greatly reduced computational cost compared to existing methods, allowing us to efficiently sample from the posterior distribution of the inverse problem. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in comparison to alternative optimization methods on a variety of synthetic and real-world problems, including medical and fluid dynamics applications. Furthermore, we show that the samples produced by our method cover well the high-posterior density regions in all of the experiments.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75797' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(778)' class='star'><span class='star778'>&star;</span></a> Ivona Brandic  <span id='bitlink-2116'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2116)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2116' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2116)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Edge Computing as a Missing Link in the Post Moore Era</b><br />Ivona Brandic<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-170.html'>A Roadmap to Robust Science for High-throughput Applications: Use Cases and Lessons Learned</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>In the first part of this talk we discuss the concept of extreme performance HPC where the applications often include latencies below 100 ms or even below 10 ms. To facilitate low latency computation has to be placed in the vicinity of the end users by utilizing the concept of Edge Computing. We present the novel failure resilience mechanisms applied to Edge systems considering timeliness, hyper-heterogeneity and resource scarcity. We discuss our machine learning based mechanism that evaluates the failure resilience of a service deployed redundantly on the Edge infrastructures. Our approach learns the spatiotemporal dependencies between Edge server failures and combines them with the topological information to incorporate link failures by utilizing the concept of the Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs).     
In the second part we discuss the potential impact of Edge Computing in the current rise of highly specialized architectures ranging from neuromorphic to quantum computing. As we experience the paradigm shift from generalized architectures of the Von Neumann era to highly specialized architectures in the Post-Moore’s law era we expect the coexistence of multiple types of architectures specialized for different types of computation. We define the two of the architectures that attracted the most interest in the research community, where we witness not only theoretical developments but also first implementations and practical use cases.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75469' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1351)' class='star'><span class='star1351'>&star;</span></a> Axel Brando  <span id='bitlink-2117'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2117)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2117' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2117)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Designing Reliable AI-Based Critical Systems</b><br />Axel Brando<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-298.html'>Robust Uncertainty Quantification and Inference - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Increasingly, modern domains like automotive, railway or aerospace depend on more and more number of critical functionalities in Embedded Critical Systems which rely on Deep Learning (DL) models, such as ground and onboard operations in avionics and decision-making functions in autonomous automotive systems.

Due to the computationally expensive nature of their standard solution methods, neural PDE surrogates have become an active research topic to accelerate these simulations.  However, the practical utility of training such surrogates is contingent on their ability to model complex multi-scale spatio-temporal phenomena.  In this talk, we address two challenges of neural network PDE surrogates:  (i)  How to take into account the relationship between different fields and their internal components, which are often correlated?  We therefore view the time evolution of correlated fields through the lens of multivector fields allows which allows us to introduce new operations that are grounded on the algebraic properties of Clifford algebras.  (ii) How to model multi-scale phenomena and generalize across timescales and equations? We therefore analyze design considerations of Fourier and U-Net based PDE surrogate models, showing promising results on generalization to different PDE parameters and time-scales with a single surrogate model.  We conclude by given an outlook how the proposed methods directly help to tackle imminent challenges in neural PDE surrogate modeling.

The change from tensor-product-splines to any of these adaptive-spline-space requires adapting the assemblying, preconditioning and solving strategies in order to mantain efficiency.

We refer in particular to Lagrangian data, which provide information on the trajectories followed by vehicles, and Eulerian data, which measure the transit of cars from fixed positions. We show how this combination of a second-order macroscopic model with microscopic information makes it possible to reproduce significant variations in speed and acceleration that strongly influence traffic emissions. Accurate approximations are obtained even with few trajectory data. The proposed approach is therefore a computationally efficient and accurate tool for calculating macroscopic traffic quantities and estimating emissions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75520' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(367)' class='star'><span class='star367'>&star;</span></a> Christopher Brissette  <span id='bitlink-2123'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2123)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2123' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2123)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Spectrum Aware Coarsening for Graph Partitioning</b><br />Christopher Brissette<br />Thursday, March 2 5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-81.html'>Optimization, Design, and Machine Learning in the FASTMath SciDAC-5 Institute - Part I of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Graph partitioning is a problem with applications in data mining, parallel computing, and scientific computing. For parallel computations, obtaining a balanced partition is desirable when distributing workloads. Unfortunately well studied methods such as spectral partitioning are too slow to be effective for this step at scale . For this reason, multilevel methods such as METIS coarsen the graph before performing spectral partitioning at the coarsest level and subsequently refining the partition. The quality of the partitions yielded from these multilevel methods tend to rely heavily on the quality of the coarsening. This quality is measured by how well the spectral cuts of the coarsened graph represent the true spectral cuts on the finest graph. We investigate the spectral approximation properties of different coarsening methods and implement these methods in parallel on GPU. We show that the spectral approximation properties of different coarsening algorithms vary significantly as do the quality of their output partitions.

Popular spatial models are predominantly reaction-diffusion equations of Fisher-KPP type. However, Brownian motion that leads to a constant diffusion coefficient is a rough first approximation to fish behaviour. For two species of reef snapper, around 5% of the population (rangers) travel much further than the majority (home-stayers). This is not explainable by linear diffusion. Possibilities of improved mobility models include density-dependent mobility, Gaussian mixture models and non-Brownian Levi processes with long-tailed distributions. The resulting densities satisfy nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations of fractional or integer order. Exact solutions can be obtained for the interior of a no-take area (NTA) with lethal boundary conditions that represent over-fishing in the exterior. This gives exact expressions for the critical domain size for survival in the NTA.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75348' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(863)' class='star'><span class='star863'>&star;</span></a> Anna Broms  <span id='bitlink-2125'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2125)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2125' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2125)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Closely Interacting Rigid Particles in Stokes Flow with Contact Handling and Local Corrections</b><br />Anna Broms<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-189.html'>Numerical Methods for Particle Suspensions and Fluid-Structure Interactions at Small Scales - Part II of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>The multiblob method is an inexpensive and approximate technique for simulations of particles in Stokes flow. We improve on its accuracy for rigid axisymmetric particles in 3D free space by reducing two different error contributions: self-interaction and pair-interaction errors, dominant in the far-field and near-field respectively. The later reduction is done by local pair-corrections as inspired by Stokesian dynamics. As we study the particles dynamically, more challenges are introduced -- despite the more accurate description -- something that holds true for any choice of Stokes solver. Rigid particles in a Stokesian fluid can physically not overlap, as a thin layer of fluid always separates a particle pair, exerting increasingly strong repulsive forces on the bodies for decreasing separations. Numerically, resolving these lubrication forces comes at an intractably large cost and particle collisions and overlaps do occur. In this talk, non-overlap constraints, in terms of the Euclidean distance between boundary points on the particles, are represented via a barrier energy. We solve for the minimum magnitudes of repelling contact forces between any particle pair in contact to correct for overlaps, by enforcing the barrier energy to be zero at the next time step. The method is tested on suspensions of spheres, rods and boomerang shaped particles where collision free configurations can be obtained at all  instances in time.

In this work we present multigrid solvers for high-order finite element discretizations of these Riesz maps with optimal complexity in polynomial degree, i.e.~with the same time and space complexity as sum-factorized operator application. The key idea of our approach is to build new finite elements for each space in the de Rham complex with orthogonality properties in both the $L^2$ and $H(\mathrm{d})$ inner products ($\mathrm{d} \in \{\mathrm{grad}, \mathrm{curl}, \mathrm{div}\})$ on the reference hexahedron. The resulting sparsity enables the fast solution of the patch problems arising in the generalised Arnold--Falk--Winther and Hiptmair space decompositions, in the separable case. In the non-separable case, the method can be applied to a spectrally-equivalent auxiliary operator. With exact Cholesky factorizations of the sparse patch problems, the application complexity is optimal but the setup costs and storage are not. We overcome this with the use of incomplete Cholesky factorizations with carefully specified sparsity patterns arising from static condensation. This yields multigrid relaxations with computational complexity and storage that are both optimal in the polynomial degree.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75449' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(657)' class='star'><span class='star657'>&star;</span></a> Jake Brusca  <span id='bitlink-2128'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2128)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2128' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2128)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Monotone Discretization of the Monge-Amp&#232;re Equation Through Quadrature</b><br />Jake Brusca<br />Wednesday, March 1 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-144.html'>Monge-Ampere Equations: Numerical Methods and Applications - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>The Monge-Ampère equation is a fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic PDE used in a large number of applications including mesh generation, optical design, and medical image processing. The development of convergent numerical methods for this PDE has been guided by the Barles and Souganidis framework, which requires the use of monotone schemes. However, existing monotone schemes are built using wide stencils, which are low accuracy and expensive to construct - in 3D just evaluating these schemes can be prohibitively expensive. In this talk, I will introduce an integral representation of the Monge-Ampère equation, which leads to a new monotone discretization through the use of numerical quadrature. By using higher order quadrature, we are able to improve on both the formal truncation error and the computational cost of evaluating the scheme, while preserving the monotonicity of the scheme. The result is a provably convergent scheme that allows for narrower stencils and better accuracy than existing methods. Computational results confirm the expected accuracy and efficiency.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75439' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1319)' class='star'><span class='star1319'>&star;</span></a> Kobe Bruyninckx  <span id='bitlink-2129'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2129)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2129' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2129)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Aaa-Eigs: Solving Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems in Julia</b><br />Kobe Bruyninckx<br />Wednesday, March 1 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-290.html'>Recent Advances in Numerical Linear Algebra Programming and Libraries - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>The nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP) is a variant of the standard eigenvalue problem $Ax=\lambda x$ where the matrix can depend nonlinearly on the eigenvalue:  $$A(\lambda)x = 0$$  These NEPs arise in many engineering and physics applications such as acoustics and quantum mechanics. In Julia, a software package called NEP-PACK, has been developed by researchers at KTH university Stockholm to deal with and solve such NEPs. It contains an extensive library of state-of-the-art algorithms. One algorithm for solving NEPs that it does not yet provide, is AAA-EIGS. Its main application is to find eigenvalues in some specified subregion of the complex plane for large, sparse NEPs. AAA-EIGS uses AAA for setting up rational approximants of the nonlinearities in the NEP. Afterwards it linearizes the resulting rational eigenvalue problem and solves it using a compact version of the rational Krylov method (CORK). The eigenpairs computed by CORK are related to eigenpairs of the original NEP. When implementing AAA-EIGS in Julia, we numerically compare its performance to that of a similar method in NEP-PACK, named NLEIGS. They mainly differ in the way the rational approximation is constructed. Experiments show that the new AAA-EIGS implementation does significantly better than NLEIGS for most problems, which can be attributed to the use of AAA and a better implementation of CORK. Future work can be done to extend the AAA-EIGS implementation with more features to improve its performance.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75649' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1582)' class='star'><span class='star1582'>&star;</span></a> Spencer H.

It applies sparse reconstruction to expose local features in the differential operator and reconstructs the coarse one in only a few matrix-vector products. For non-local operators, we prepend this approach by peeling long-range effects with dense matrix-vector products to expose a more local operator. We demonstrate the algorithm's performance on scalar transport and channel flow problems.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75264' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1695)' class='star'><span class='star1695'>&star;</span></a> Ron Buckmire  <span id='bitlink-2131'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2131)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2131' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2131)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Quantitative Justice Primer: The \#MetaMath Project and Other Examples</b><br />Ron Buckmire<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-375.html'>Presentations by LGBTQ Mathematicians</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>The application of techniques, tools and topics from various quantitative sciences (e.g., applied mathematics, data science, computer science, etc.) in subject domains that are derived from the social sciences (e.g., political science, law, economics, history, etc.) with the goal of promoting social justice has been dubbed &#8220;quantitative justice." This talk shall provide a primer on quantitative justice (QJ) for attendees of CSE23 and include several examples of work that can be described under the QJ moniker.     
The {\bf \#MetaMath} project is one of several initiatives to emerge from the ICERM Data Science and Social Justice program held in \href{https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/ep-22-dssj/}{Summer 2022} and continuing in \href{https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/ep-22-dssj/}{Summer 2023}. The primary idea animating \#MetaMath is the application of quantitative justice techniques to the mathematics community itself. Some things that fall under the \#metaMath tag include meditations on the many definitions of the term &#8220;mathematician" and their implications and significance, suggestions for how to address the paucity of robust demographic data on important aspects of the mathematics community, and outlines for future projects that could fit under the aegis of \#MetaMath.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75821' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1538)' class='star'><span class='star1538'>&star;</span></a> Ana Budisa  <span id='bitlink-2132'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2132)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2132' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2132)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multilevel Methods for Nearly-Singular Problems in Mixed Dimensions</b><br />Ana Budisa<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-339.html'>High Performance Computing Tools for Mixed Dimensional Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>We consider parameter-robust algebraic multigrid methods for a class of operators that appear in preconditioning of monolithic multiphysics systems on domains of mixed dimensions.

Climate change and ever increasing competition have produced serious challenges for potato breeding, cultivation and processing industries. Of course, this holds for other areas of horticulture and for agriculture, in general, as well. Although agriculture was among the earliest applications of statistics and experimental design, these new challenges often require novel mathematical approaches. For example, large throughput phenotyping is a well-known application for modern image processing meth-ods.  In this talk we discuss mathematical and computational problems that arose during our participation in a series of potato-industry-driven projects and share our solutions. We focus on the problems of spatial and temporal effect removal in field trials and on over-parameterized machine learning of predictive models for cultivation and breeding. In both cases one needs to recover a piecewise smooth function of either several or extremely many variables from poorly structured and sparse data.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75779' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1977)' class='star'><span class='star1977'>&star;</span></a> Annalisa Buffa  <span id='bitlink-2134'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2134)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2134' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2134)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Forward Looking Panel</b><br />Annalisa Buffa, Magnus Fontes, Thomas Kropf, Satoshi Matsuoka, John Shalf<br />Thursday, March 2 1:00 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77139' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1194)' class='star'><span class='star1194'>&star;</span></a> Martin Buhmann  <span id='bitlink-2135'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2135)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2135' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2135)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Positive Definite Kernels on General Regular Domains</b><br />Martin Buhmann<br />Wednesday, March 1 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-262.html'>Advances in Radial Basis Functions for Numerical Simulation - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>Positive definite functions and kernels are an important tool for interpolation and approximation of functions in several dimensions.

The method scans the object of interest in a series of overlapping positions, thereby generating a set of multiple Fourier magnitude measurements that are potentially corrupted by noise. From these measurements, a high-quality image of the object can be reconstructed depending on how the related inverse problem is formulated and solved. In this paper, we propose a class of variational models that incorporate the weighted anisotropic-isotropic total variation (AITV), an effective regularizer for image recovery. This class of models is applicable to measurements corrupted with either Gaussian or Poisson noise. In order to have the models applicable for large number of ptychographic scans, we design an efficient stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and establish its convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that from a large set of  highly corrupted Fourier measurements, the proposed stochastic algorithm with AITV regularization can reconstruct complex-valued images with satisfactory quality, especially for the phase components.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75569' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(589)' class='star'><span class='star589'>&star;</span></a> Tan Bui-Thanh  <span id='bitlink-2137'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2137)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2137' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2137)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>TNet: A Tikhonov Neural Network Approach to Deterministic and Bayesian Inverse Problems</b><br />Tan Bui-Thanh<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-129.html'>Goal-Oriented and Context-Aware Scientific Machine Learning - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>Deep Learning (DL) by design is purely data-driven and in general does not require physics. This is the strength of DL but also one of its key limitations. DL methods in their original forms are not capable of respecting the underlying mathematical models or achieving desired accuracy even in big-data regimes. On the other hand, many data-driven science and engineering problems, such as inverse problems, typically have limited experimental or observational data, and DL would overfit the data in this case. Leveraging information encoded in the underlying mathematical models not only compensates missing information in low data regimes but also provides opportunities to equip DL methods with the underlying physics and hence obtaining higher accuracy. This talk introduces a Tikhonov Network (TNet) that is capable of learning Tikhonov regularized inverse problems. We rigorously show that our TNet approach can learn information encoded in the underlying mathematical models, and thus can produce consistent or equivalent inverse solutions, while naive purely data-based counterparts cannot. Furthermore, we theoretically study the error estimate between TNet and Tikhhonov inverse solutions and under which conditions they are the same. Extension to statistical inverse problems will also be presented.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75416' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(5)' class='star'><span class='star5'>&star;</span></a> Zvonimir Bujanovic  <span id='bitlink-2138'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2138)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2138' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2138)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Norm and Trace Estimation Using Rank-One Random Vectors</b><br />Zvonimir Bujanovic<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-1.html'>Randomized Linear Algebra in Scientific Computing - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>A few matrix-vector multiplications with random vectors are often sufficient to obtain reasonably good estimates for the norm of a general matrix or the trace of a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix. Several such probabilistic estimators have been proposed and analyzed for standard Gaussian and Rademacher random vectors. In this talk, we discuss the use of rank-one random vectors, that is, Kronecker products of (smaller) Gaussian or Rademacher vectors. It is not only cheaper to sample such vectors but it can sometimes also be much cheaper to multiply a matrix with a rank-one vector instead of a general vector. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence that the use of rank-one instead of unstructured random vectors still leads to good estimates. In particular, we show that our rank-one estimators multiplied with a modest constant constitute, with high probability, both upper and lower bounds of the quantity of interest. We illustrate the application of our techniques to condition number estimation for matrix functions.

One of the primary remaining challenges to building fully automatic fast spectral solvers is handling arbitrary boundary conditions. For domains with a single bounded dimension (e.g. an annulus or spherical shell), this can be reliably achieved with spectral integration and the classical tau method. For domains with multiple bounded dimensions (e.g. closed squares and cubes), consistency conditions at the corners and shared edges pose a challenge, particularly for mixed boundary conditions. Here we will discuss a generalized tau scheme where analytic perturbations are added to the PDEs and boundary conditions that result in consistent and exactly solvable discrete systems. In particular, we will examine the Poisson equation with generic mixed boundary conditions on the square and cube. This tau-perturbed system can be easily modified to use different test and trial spaces and is entirely isotropic, making it particularly favorable for incorporation into spectral element schemes.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75528' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(447)' class='star'><span class='star447'>&star;</span></a> Azka Muji Burohman  <span id='bitlink-2143'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2143)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2143' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2143)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Dissipativity-Preserving Reduced-Order Modeling from Data</b><br />Azka Muji Burohman<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-99.html'>Optimization-Based and Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling of Structured Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>Reduced-order modeling from data with dissipativity preservation is discussed in this talk. Employing the data informativity framework, the dissipativity of all systems consistent with noisy data can be characterized by a data-based linear matrix inequality (LMI). Furthermore, semi-definite programming duality helps us to prove the existence of minimal and maximal solutions to the LMI. As in the classical bounded-real and positive-real balanced truncation, these extremal solutions play a role in the computation of well-approximating reduced-order models carrying the dissipativity property. As an additional advantage of using this balancing-type method, a priori error bounds of the reduced-order models are available.

Disinformation campaigns with the presence of a committed minority are of particular concern because a minority with as low as 10% of the population can overtake the majority’s opinion. This phenomenon is characterized by a strong tipping point (phase transition) separating two distinct outcomes. Previous studies employed the binary agreement model on Erd&#337;s-R&eacute;nyi random, scale-free, and complete networks. Here, we examine the binary agreement model on hundreds of random graphs of several types (e.g., barbell, small world, etc.) to connect the tipping point to graph metrics (e.g., assortativity, betweenness, etc.). We also explore the dynamics on Facebook networks. The binary agreement model is run to steady state on all networks utilizing hundreds of core hours. Using the data generated in these simulations, we calculate correlation functions of individual’s opinions and calculate scaling exponents of the phase transitions.

This is achieved through a two-step process, where the shallow-water system is first solved in Lagrangian coordinates, called the Lagrangian step, and then the results are projected into Eulerian coordinates, called the Projection step. The Lagrangian step can be done implicitly, while the Projection step is always done explicitly. This approach separates the acoustic and the transport phenomena, allowing for larger time steps with restrictions based on slower transport waves instead of acoustic ones. Furthermore, we are currently working on developing implicit fully well-balanced schemes that preserve all the steady states. In this sense, we will also be providing an idea of how to develop explicit fully well-balanced schemes, which will help us accomplish our goal.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75510' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(659)' class='star'><span class='star659'>&star;</span></a> Alexandre Caboussat  <span id='bitlink-2148'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2148)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2148' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2148)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Methods for the Numerical Solution of Some Fully Nonlinear Equations</b><br />Alexandre Caboussat<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-145.html'>Monge-Ampere Equations: Numerical Methods and Applications - Part II of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>We focus on adaptive mesh refinement methods for first- or second order fully nonlinear equations in two space dimensions. As prototypical examples, the canonical Monge-Ampère equation (second order) and the nonlinear maps problem (first order) are addressed.     
Splitting methods are developed via variational and least-squares approaches. They allow to solve a sequence of linear variational problems and of algebraic eigenvalue problems. Mixed, low order, finite element approximations are used for the discretization. The linear variational problems are solved with a conjugate gradient algorithm, while the algebraic eigenvalue problems are solved locally with dedicated mathematical programming techniques.    
The goal is to extend the methodology by coupling the splitting methods with mesh adaptation. Low order, piecewise linear, finite elements are used for space discretization. Residual-based, a posteriori error estimates are derived based on the linear variational problems only. A mesh refinement strategy is implemented within the iterative loop. When dealing with line singularities, anisotropic adaptive techniques allow to obtain refined triangulations near these edges. When dealing with point singularities, isotropic adaptive techniques are used instead.      
Numerical experiments show that the method exhibits appropriate convergence orders and a robust behavior. Adaptive mesh refinement proves to be efficient and accurate to tackle test cases with singularities.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75440' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(313)' class='star'><span class='star313'>&star;</span></a> Xiao-Chuan Cai  <span id='bitlink-2149'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2149)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2149' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2149)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A PCA Based Nonlinear Preconditioner and Applications</b><br />Xiao-Chuan Cai<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-69.html'>Data-Driven Methods in Computational Biomechanics - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>We discuss a novel nonlinearly preconditioned inexact Newton method for solving nonlinear system of algebraic equations from the discretization of highly nonlinear PDEs.

In this talk, we propose an iterative method for solving composite collocation problems parallel-in-time, across multiple steps, by firstly forming the all-at-once system. These problems are typically the basis for the multi-level PFASST algorithm. In contrast to PFASST’s multi-level approach, we use single-level preconditioned Richardson iterations with an $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner which can be diagonalized using fast Fourier transformations (FFT) in time, making this method a class of ParaDiag algorithms. Using FFT in time on the preconditioner, the communication becomes very efficient and there is no need to worry about coarsening strategies, which may be a source of error when solving hyperbolic problems. As a consequence, we obtain time-interval decoupled problems in each iteration which we propose to solve directly in parallel, across the collocation nodes, using a diagonalization of the slightly modified quadrature matrix. This brings us to a doubly parallel-in-time method that solves linear problems very efficiently, from where an extension to nonlinear problems is made. We present theoretical and practical convergence and performance results as well as the strengths and weaknesses of this method.

OED formulates the choice of experiment as an optimization problem that maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) about quantities of interest given prior knowledge and models of expected observation data.     
We use Bayesian OED to find optimal sensor configurations for detecting seismic events as part of a seismic monitoring network. We configure sensor networks by choosing sensor locations, types, and fidelity in order to improve our ability to identify and locate seismic sources.  In this work, we develop the framework necessary to use Bayesian OED to optimize a sensor network's ability to locate seismic events from arrival time data of detected seismic phases. As part of this framework we introduce methods for performing importance sampling on difficult prior distributions and methods for placing unusual constraints on our optimization domain to account for real world limits on sensor location.     
Once we have developed this framework, we can explore many relevant questions to monitoring such as how to trade off sensor fidelity and earth model uncertainty, how choice of prior distribution and domain restrictions affect sensor placement, and how sensor types, number, and locations influence uncertainty.

In this talk we propose to use hierarchical Bayesian models for sparse dictionary learning that can capture features of the underlying signals, e.g., sparse representation and nonnegativity. The same framework can be employed to reduce the dimensionality of an annotated  dictionary through feature extraction, thus reducing the computational complexity of the learning task.

Nevertheless, being a gapless conductor in its pristine form, it cannot be used for modeling Field Effect Transistors (FET), consequently other solutions have to be investigated to overcome the problem. A solution is the use of graphene nano-ribbons  which exhibit a band gap inversely proportional to the width of the strip, another solution is offered by the use of bilayer graphene where a tunable band gap can be induced by applying an electric field.    Here we propose a preliminary study for a FET, with graphene bilayer in the active area, by using a Monte Carlo simulation.

Firstly, the concept of data reduction is introduced. In par- ticular, we show that the set of reduced-order models obtained by applying a Petrov-Galerkin projection to all systems explaining the data characterized in a large-dimensional quadratic matrix inequality (QMI) can again be character- ized in a lower-dimensional QMI. Next, we develop a data-driven generalized balanced truncation method that relies on two steps. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions such that systems explaining the data have common generalized Gramians. Second, these common generalized Gramians are used to construct projection matrices that allow to characterize a class of reduced-order models via generalized balanced truncation in terms of a lower-dimensional QMI by applying the data reduction concept. Additionally, we present alternative procedures to compute a priori and a posteriori upper bounds with respect to the true system generating the data. Finally, the proposed techniques are il- lustrated by means of application to an example of a system of a cart with a double-pendulum.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75472' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1242)' class='star'><span class='star1242'>&star;</span></a> Bego&#241;a Cano  <span id='bitlink-2161'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2161)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2161' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2161)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Avoiding Order Reduction with Explicit Runge-Kutta Exponential Methods in Nonlinear Initial Boundary Value Problems</b><br />Bego&#241;a Cano<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-273.html'>Innovations in Time Integration of Stiff Systems of Differential Equations - Part II of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>A technique will be shown to recover the classical order of the method when explicit exponential Runge-Kutta methods integrate reaction-diffusion problems.

This involves a hierarchy of libraries that: i) represent polynomial expansions in a standardised element, ii) a map from a standard to a local element and iii) a library which contained geometric properties for integration and differentiation in the local element.  To construct a piecewise expansion over a domain of multiple local elements we then built a library of multiple local expansions which contains  connectivity information for a CG or DG scalar field. We also chose to hold the local expansion coefficients and operators such as differentiation and integration over the whole computational domain in this last library.    
We are currently revisiting this library structure since it is not appropriate on modern streaming architectures such as GPUs. A necessary step of our re-design is to remove the underlying operators and scalar field storage from the top level library level. Our new design is essentially inverting the current top level concept so that the operators hold the necessary expansion information about connectivity and is passed a storage field that contains multiple scalar fields in different layouts depending on the target architecture. In this presentation we discuss our strategy to take our legacy code, maintain backwards compatibility for our current users whilst evolving this new structure for efficient use of GPUs and vectorised CPUs.

It involves a procedure consisting of model calibration, selection, and validation of phase field models centered around Bayes’ rule and image data produced by microscopy or X-ray scattering characterizations. The aleatoric uncertainties of Di-BCP self-assembly represented by metastability and defectivity require introducing randomness into model predictions. These uncertainties, however, lead to integrated likelihoods that are generally intractable to evaluate. To tackle this challenge that hampers the execution of the predictive modeling procedure, likelihood-free inference approaches via pseudo-marginal methods and measure transport are considered in this study. To improve the efficiency of these inference methodologies, they are used in adjunct with carefully designed summary statistics that extract features of characterization images. Several Fourier- and energy-based summary statistics are proposed for top-down microscopy characterizations of Di-BCP thin films. Expected information gains are used to quantify the utilities of summary statistics choices, and we show that they can be computed via measure transport with no significant additional computational cost.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75774' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1251)' class='star'><span class='star1251'>&star;</span></a> Yanzhao Cao  <span id='bitlink-2165'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2165)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2165' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2165)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stochastic Gradient Descent Alternating Least Square Method for High-Order Tensor Decomposition</b><br />Yanzhao Cao<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-275.html'>Machine Learning for Large-Scale Scientific Data Analysis and Model Simulations - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>High-order tensors have applications in many areas (biology, finance, engineering, etc.). One of the key issues in high-order tensor research is the optimal rank one decomposition of a tensor, which is comparable to the singular value decompositions (SVD) for matrices. Unlike SVD, the rank one decomposition problem for high-order tensors is NP-hard.   The Stochastic Gradient Descent Alternating Least Squares (SALS) method is a generalization of the well-known Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method that approximates the canonical decomposition of averages of sampled random tensors. Its simplicity and efficient memory usage make the SALS   algorithm an ideal tool for decomposing tensors in an online setting. This talk will discuss the convergence of the SALS as well as its application to scientific data analysis.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75623' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1229)' class='star'><span class='star1229'>&star;</span></a> Franck Cappello  <span id='bitlink-2166'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2166)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2166' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2166)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>How Much Can We Really Compress Scientific Data?</b><br />Franck Cappello<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-270.html'>Recent Advances in Lossy Compression and Data Reduction Methods for Scientific Data - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>Lossy compression of scientific data sees a growing interest from different domain sciences. During the past 5-6 years, we have witnessed a significant diversification of use cases ranging from classic visualization to more advanced lossy compression of data in communications or memory. We are also observing a blooming of lossy compression algorithms and, more importantly, continuous progress in compression quality, speed, and ratio. The lossy compression methodology has also progressed drastically with the SDRBench benchmark, the Libpressio unified API, and the Zchecker error analysis tool. However, a fundamental part is missing: the estimation of bounds of lossy compressibility. We have the Shannon entropy to compute the maximum compressibility of a data set from entropy coding. But there is no such result about the lossy compressibility of scientific data. We  can formulate the research question as: “Can we come up with the equivalent of a roof line of lossy compressibility?” Answering this question is fundamental for the research on algorithms for lossy compression of scientific data. This talk will review recent progress in lossy compression for scientific data and in lossy compressibility bound estimation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75612' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1835)' class='star'><span class='star1835'>&star;</span></a> Juan M.

Cardenas<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:50 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-404.html'>Learning Deep Neural Networks and Sparse Approximations from Limited Data for High-Dimensional Problems in Computational Science and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Many problems in computational science and engineering require the approximation of a high-dimensional function from data. In many such applications, data is costly to generate: for example, it each sample may require a costly PDE solve. Therefore, it is imperative to develop highly sample efficient algorithms. Recently, deep neural networks and deep learning have shown great promise to provide breakthrough performance in challenging function approximation tasks. In this work, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy, CAS4DL (Christoffel Adaptive Sampling for Deep Learning) to increase the sample efficiency of DL. Our novel approach is based on interpreting the second to last layer of a DNN as a dictionary of functions defined by the nodes on that layer. With this viewpoint, we then define an adaptive sampling strategy motivated by adaptive sampling schemes recently proposed for linear approximation schemes, wherein samples are drawn randomly with respect to the Christoffel function of the subspace spanned by this dictionary. We present numerical experiments comparing CAS4DL with standard Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. Our results demonstrate that CAS4DL often yields substantial savings in the number of samples required to achieve a given accuracy, particularly in the case of smooth activation functions. These results, therefore, are a promising step toward fully adapting DL to scientific computing applications.

These developments put a high demand on the system software and programming environment. This talk will discuss the approaches of three related research projects in Europe: DEEP-SEA, IO-SEA and RED-SEA. The projects address Software for Exascale Architectures, driven by application use cases, from the perspectives of heterogeneity and the modular supercomputer architecture, I/O and storage, and the interconnect.    
This talk will outline the main software research directions. Performance portability and productivity are key challenges, requiring compiler and runtime intelligence, and a separation of the source code from its optimizations. Heterogeneous memory systems are targeted through APIs and automated data placement. All layers, including resource management middleware, are being updated to support malleability, i.e. to allow jobs to dynamically adjust their resource usage. Data management and hierarchical storage are being updated to span NVMe and NVRAM down to the least active data on tape.

First, in a so-called “non-intrusive” ML, we will show the  use of supervised learning to estimate the local Lyapunov exponents (LLEs) based  exclusively on the system’s state. In this approach, ML is used as a supplementary tool,  added to the given physical model. Our results prove ML is successful in retrieving the  correct LLEs, although the skill is itself dependent on the degree of local homogeneity of  the LLEs on the system’s attractor.  In the second and third approach, ML is used to substitute fully or partly a physical  model with a surrogate one reconstructed from data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75425' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(563)' class='star'><span class='star563'>&star;</span></a> Francesco Carravetta  <span id='bitlink-2174'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2174)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2174' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2174)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quadratization of Differential Equations: the Connection with Analogic and Digital Computability of Their Solutions</b><br />Francesco Carravetta<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-124.html'>Exact Polynomialization and Quadratization of Nonlinear Dynamics - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>In this talk a recent method, said 'exact quadratization', of manifold immersion where the image vector field is always quadratic in the local, whatever chosen, coordinates is described, and the relevance of such kind of immersion is illustrated in problems of applied mathematics.

The problem of classify quadratizable nonlinear functions is also sketched. It will be shown that this problem is closely related with computability, and in particular that the class of quadratizable functions consists of all the functions that can be generated though analog computer, which in turn consists (for ODEs) of all differentially algebraic functions.

It is of paramount importance in healthy processes such as organ growth and repair and wound healing, and also in pathologies such as cancer or retinopathies. It is triggered by the emission of vessel growth substances from a region of tissue lacking oxygen. On mesoscopic scales large compared to cell size but small compared to organ size, it can be modeled using stochastic differential equations and birth/death processes for branching of blood vessels and for their merging (anastomosis). From the stochastic process, we have derived a transport equation for the density of active tips of blood vessels, which is parabolic and contains source terms for branching and anastomosis that include a memory term. It is coupled to a reaction-diffusion equation for the growth factor concentration. Numerical simulation of the transport equation and the underlying stochastic process show that the density evolves towards a moving soliton-like wave whose velocity and shape change slowly according to some ordinary differential equations for collective coordinates. We have also developed a theory of fluctuations about the density by adding multiplicative noises to the transport equation. The moments of the density turn out to be given by powers of the soliton solution with appropriate exponents.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75502' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1871)' class='star'><span class='star1871'>&star;</span></a> Allison Carson  <span id='bitlink-2177'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2177)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2177' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2177)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Upwind Finite-Difference Schemes For Wave Equations On Overset Grids</b><br />Allison Carson<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(426)' class='star'><span class='star426'>&star;</span></a> Erin C.

To illustrate the effect of particle's narrowness (that can be related to parity properties) and the need for adapted methods (in the context of boundary integral methods), we consider the scattering by a penetrable, high aspect ratio ellipse. This problem highlights the main challenge and provides valuable insights to tackle general high aspect ratio particles. We find that boundary integral operators are nearly singular due to the collapsing geometry to a line segment. We show that these nearly singular behaviours lead to qualitatively different asymptotic behaviours for solutions with different parities. Without explicitly taking this into account, computed solutions incur large errors. We introduce the Quadrature by Parity Asymptotic eXpansions (QPAX) that effectively and efficiently addresses these issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QPAX through several numerical examples (potentially including high-order QPAX results).

In order to make many-query predictive simulation of such systems tractable, as required for e.g. design optimization and uncertainty quantification efforts, accurate surrogate models are typically required. In this work we employ neural operator surrogates using the deep operator network (DeepONet) architecture to construct surrogates for the full temporal solution of chemical dynamical systems models arising in plasma and reacting flow applications.  In particular we explore the opportunity for constructing such surrogates on reduced dimensional representations of the chemical species state, propose network augmentations to overcome expense associated with temporal symmetries arising in the training data, and investigate user-defined temporal modes for accelerating network training. Results are presented for surrogates applied to spatially homogeneous chemistry models relevant to CFD solvers for reacting flows and low-temperature fluid plasmas.

This comes with an increase in importance for a sustainable and efficient development and development workflows and RSE practices to be applied for research software projects. An important cornerstone for the efficient and sustainable development of these are continuous integration and testing or similar techniques.    
Commonly available solutions rely on shared, public infrastructures and services. While these offer good accessibility and usability for many projects, they are not well suited for all demands of software targeting usage on HPC clusters. Such projects need to be developed, tested and verified with the targeted cluster, architecture and potential usage of accelerators in mind. In addition, infrastructure offering a stable and reliable environment, especially in terms of performance, are an essential component for deriving and comparing benchmark results in a continuous manner.    
For supporting research software projects targeting HPC clusters, an environment for a sustainable development, which offers a similar usage-experience as the previously mentioned services, needs to be adopted, integrated and offered on HPC clusters.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75705' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(804)' class='star'><span class='star804'>&star;</span></a> Nicola Castelletto  <span id='bitlink-2183'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2183)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2183' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2183)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>HPC Multiphysics Simulation of CO$_2$ Geological Storage</b><br />Nicola Castelletto<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-176.html'>Reliable and Efficient Methods for Coupled Problems in Porous Media - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Safe and efficient operation of CO$_2$ geological storage projects requires numerical simulation of a multi-physics problem in which compositional multiphase flow and transport are tightly coupled with the porous medium deformation. To simulate these processes, one needs to solve a set of coupled, nonlinear, time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the conservation of mass of each component and linear momentum of the solid-fluid mixture. We present a scalable fully-implicit framework based on a displacement/pressure/component density formulation. The discrete displacement field is approximated using nodal interpolation. Pressure and component densities are assumed cell-wise constant, with interface pressure also present if a hybridization strategy is chosen. A Newton-Krylov approach is used to advance the solution in time, with a finely-tuned multigrid reduction (MGR) preconditioner introduced to accelerate convergence. The solver is implemented in an open-source, exascale-compatible, research-oriented simulator for modeling fully coupled flow, transport and geomechanics in geological formations. Numerical results are presented to illustrate performance and robustness of the proposed solver on a variety of challenging test problems, including realistic field cases.

Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for UQ, yet ML models like Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) challenge many traditional inference algorithms. This has motivated the use of approximate Bayesian inference methods like Variational Inference (VI) within ML. While VI has significant computational advantages over traditional algorithms like Markov Chain Monte Carlo, many challenges remain with VI for Bayesian UQ in ML such as the robustness of UQ to often ad hoc assumptions of variational family and prior distribution.       
We seek to mitigate some of these deficiencies by taking a goal-oriented approach. Our approach, Posterior Predictive Variational Inference (PPVI) seeks to optimize VI to make specific predictions. This means that uncertainty is optimally represented to answer specific questions at hand. This makes UQ more accurate for these specified quantities of interest and makes it easier to understand the robustness of these methods to assumptions. We will present theory, algorithms, and illustrative examples for PPVI to describe its utility to CSE.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75808' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(276)' class='star'><span class='star276'>&star;</span></a> Francesca Cavallini  <span id='bitlink-2185'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2185)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2185' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2185)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stochastic Collocation for Neural Field Equations with Random Data</b><br />Francesca Cavallini<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-61.html'>Exploring Complexity in Life Sciences with Modeling and Simulations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Neural fields equations model the activity of the brain cortex subject to an external stimulus. These spatially-extended dynamical systems are specified by modelling brain characteristics such as the synaptic kernel and firing rate of neurons, which are generally only partially available in experiments. Tools from uncertainty quantification are key to understanding neuronal behaviour and making predictions of how the brain responds to external stimuli, crucial problem in healthcare and biological applications.    
Motivated by these considerations, we build a numerical scheme for neural fields with random data (input, synaptic kernel, firing rate, or initial conditions) producing a pointwise approximation of the expectation and variance of neural activity at any space-time coordinate. Our approach consists in casting the system into a set of ODEs on a Banach space, and using a two steps scheme to approximate the solution’s mean and variance. The implemented algorithm performs a spatial projection followed by a stochastic projection. In this talk, we explain and motivate possible choices for the projectors (interpolator and orthogonal) and the corresponding quadrature rules to approximate the integrals. In particular, we demonstrate optimal convergence of stochastic collocation analytically and present numerical results.

Simulation of the convection-dominated case, even with high-fidelity techniques, is particularly challenging due to sharp boundary layers and shocks causing jumps and discontinuities in the solution, and numerical issues such as loss of the maximum principle in the discretization. These complications cause instabilities, admitting large oscillations in the numerical solutions when using traditional methods. Drawing connections to the simplex-averaged finite element method (S. Wu and J. Xu, 2020), we develop a mimetic finite-difference (MFD) discretization using exponentially averaged coefficients to guarantee monotonicity of the scheme and stability of the solution as the diffusion coefficient approaches zero. The finite-element framework allows for transparent analysis of the MFD, such as proving well-posedness and deriving error estimates from the finite-element setting. Numerical tests are presented confirming the stability of the method and verifying the error estimates.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75651' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1640)' class='star'><span class='star1640'>&star;</span></a> Paul Cazeaux  <span id='bitlink-2187'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2187)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2187' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2187)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Randomized Algorithms for Rounding in the Tensor-Train Format</b><br />Paul Cazeaux<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-362.html'>Randomized Solvers in Large-Scale Scientific Computing - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>The Tensor-Train (TT) format is a highly compact low-rank representation for high-dimensional tensors. The fundamental operation used to maintain feasible memory and computational time is called rounding, which truncates the internal ranks of a tensor already in TT format. We propose several randomized algorithms for this task that are generalizations of randomized low-rank matrix approximation algorithms and provide significant reduction in computation compared to deterministic TT-rounding algorithms. Randomization is particularly effective in the case of rounding a sum of TT-tensors (where we observe $20\times$ speedup), which is the bottleneck computation in the adaptation of GMRES to vectors in TT format. We present the randomized algorithms and compare their empirical accuracy and computational time with deterministic alternatives.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75796' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(709)' class='star'><span class='star709'>&star;</span></a> Rafael Ceja Ayala  <span id='bitlink-2188'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2188)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2188' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2188)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Analysis of the Transmission Eigenvalue Problem with Two Conductivity Parameters</b><br />Rafael Ceja Ayala<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-156.html'>Novel Methods for Inverse Scattering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we show the existence and discreetness of the transmission eigenvalue problem with two conductivity parameters.

In this setting, time-dependent model order reduction and low-rank approximation techniques are of interest. In the present contribution, dynamical low-rank approximation for matrices together with recent developments on the topic of rank-adaptivity is briefly recapitulated. Then, appropriate notations and definitions for hierarchical tensors in Tucker format - also known as Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs) - are presented, and a robust rank-adaptive numerical integrator for the dynamical low-rank approximation of TTNs is introduced. The proposed algorithm recursively moves from the leaves to the root, updating the bases and the connection tensors via a Galerkin projection in an augmented subspace followed by a rank truncation up to a given error tolerance. It is shown that the memory requirements are linear in the order of the tensor and linear in the maximal mode dimension. Furthermore, the integrator inherits from the matrix setting property of interests such as robustness to small singular values of matricizations of the connection tensors. Up to the rank truncation error, the proposed integrator preserves norm and energy for Schroedinger equations, and it dissipates the energy in gradient systems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75372' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(214)' class='star'><span class='star214'>&star;</span></a> Luis Chacon  <span id='bitlink-2190'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2190)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2190' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2190)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Implicit, Conservative, Asymptotic-Preserving Electrostatic Particle-in-Cell Algorithm for Arbitrarily Magnetized Plasmas</b><br />Luis Chacon<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-47.html'>Taming the Curse of Dimensionality in Non-Equilibrium Transport Systems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>We discuss a new full-orbit electrostatic particle-in-cell algorithm able to use large timesteps compared to particle gyro-period in arbitrary magnetic fields [Chen et al. JCP, submitted (2022)]. The algorithm extends earlier electrostatic fully implicit PIC implementations [Chen et al., JCP 230 (2011)] with a new asymptotic-preserving (AP) particle-push scheme [Ricketson et al., JCP 418 (2020)] (recently endowed with a very fast Picard nonlinear solver [Koshkarov et al., JCP 459 (2022)]) that allows timesteps much larger than particle gyroperiods. The AP integrator preserves all the averaged particle drifts in the large-timestep limit, while recovering resolved particle orbits with small timesteps. The scheme allows for a seamless, efficient treatment of particles in coexisting magnetized and unmagnetized regions, conserves energy and charge exactly, and does not spoil implicit solver performance. We demonstrate by numerical experiment with several strongly magnetized problems (diocotron instability, modified two-stream instability, and drift-wave instability) that two orders of magnitude wall-clock-time speedups are possible vs. the standard fully implicit electrostatic PIC algorithm without sacrificing solution quality and while preserving strict charge and energy conservation.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75269' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(266)' class='star'><span class='star266'>&star;</span></a> Neil Chada  <span id='bitlink-2191'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2191)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2191' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2191)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On a Dynamic Variant of the Iteratively Regularized Gauss-Newton Method with Sequential Data</b><br />Neil Chada<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-59.html'>Computational Methods for Statistical Inverse Problems</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>In this talk we will present a variant of the iterative regularized Gauss-Newton method, which is a well-known methodology for solving inverse problems.

Due to the unbounded nature of the ocean and the complex mechanical behavior of the submarine we want to take into account, it is natural to consider a Boundary Element Method/Finite Element Method  (BEM/FEM) coupling.

The coupling between Ca2+ signalling and mechanics plays a crucial role in fertilisation, embryogenesis, wound healing, and cancer. One of the most important stages of embryogenesis is neural tube closure (NTC), which is responsible for the formation of the neural tube, the structure that later develops into the central nervous system. NTC is driven, in part, by the complex interplay of Ca2+ signalling and mechanics through Apical Constriction (AC) and malformations like anencephaly and Spina Bifida can result when this coupling is disrupted. However, this mechanochemical coupling is poorly understood and few models are available. We have developed a novel cell-based mechanochemical model that integrates Ca2+ signalling into the vertex modelling framework. Using the vertex-based model (developed in Python), we investigate how the spatial and temporal patterning of Ca2+ can trigger changes in cell shape by regulating their mechanical properties, resulting in tissue deformation, and how this deformation in turn impacts the Ca2+ patterning.  Crucially, the model reproduces key aspects of the NTC process – asynchronous, cell-autonomous Ca2+ flashes precede pulsed contractions at the cell level and a monotonic reduction of the tissue area.

However, the EIG may not always be a suitable criterion for experimenters as it is often hard to interpret and may be an indirect way of understanding the experiment. This calls for goal oriented experimental designs that directly addresses the goal of the experimenter. An added advantage of the goal oriented formulation lies in eliminating the need to work on high dimensional parameter spaces. In this paper, we consider the EIG as a function of the goal directly and thus aim to choose a design that maximises the reduction of the entropy from the marginalised prior of the goal function to the posterior of the goal function over all possible experimental outcomes. To address the computationally challenging task of efficiently computing the EIG across all design points, we propose an approach using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) that utilises simulations from the model in place of likelihood evaluations. We demonstrate the improved performance of our method over traditional Nested Monte Carlo approaches in several examples.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75414' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1068)' class='star'><span class='star1068'>&star;</span></a> Subrata Chakraborty  <span id='bitlink-2195'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2195)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2195' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2195)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Surrogate Modelling in Tunnel Realibility Analysis</b><br />Subrata Chakraborty<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-234.html'>Machine Learning and Data-Driven Methods in Probabilistic Mechanics - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75557' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(748)' class='star'><span class='star748'>&star;</span></a> Jesse Chan  <span id='bitlink-2196'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2196)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2196' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2196)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Positivity Preserving Strategy for Entropy Stable Discontinuous Galerkin Discretizations of the Compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes Equations</b><br />Jesse Chan<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-163.html'>Constructing and Exploiting Discretizations with the Summation-by-Parts Property - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>High-order entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin methods for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations require the positivity of thermodynamic quantities in order to guarantee their well-posedness. In this work, we introduce a positivity limiting strategy for entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin discretizations based on high order DG (discontinuous Galerkin) positivity-preserving limiter. The key ingredient in the limiting procedure is a low order positivity-preserving discretization based on graph viscosity terms. The proposed limiting strategy is both positivity preserving and discretely entropy-stable for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. We illustrate the behavior of the method using both analytical solutions and model problems such as the Sedov blast wave and Daru-Tenaud shock tube.

Numerical methods for the filtering recursion based on Kalman filter variants make the Gaussian assumption, and particle filters are computationally prohibitive in high dimensions. Transport map-based methods are computationally tractable and applicable to non-Gaussian problems but do not make use of the underlying dynamics present in the filtering setting. Our goal is to construct a dynamics-aware computationally tractable algorithm to sample from filtering distributions in uniformly hyperbolic systems (idealized chaotic systems). To this end, we express the filtering recursion by involving the scores (gradients of logarithms) of the filtering distribution sequence and show that these scores can be estimated efficiently by exploiting uniform hyperbolicity. We propose an ansatz for the filtering map: composition of forecast and analysis steps on the phase space. While the filtering map is not, in general, unique, our ansatz allows an interpretation of the filtering map as a conjugacy between two dynamical systems and imposes uniqueness. Such an interpretation along with the score equation constraint gives rise to a novel algorithm to perform filtering via measure transport. This algorithm is derived and demonstrated on low-dimensional hyperbolic dynamics.          </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75371' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1803)' class='star'><span class='star1803'>&star;</span></a> Sunita Chandrasekaran  <span id='bitlink-2198'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2198)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2198' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2198)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Leveraging Exascale Computing Resources for Particle-In-Cell on GPU (PIConGPU)</b><br />Sunita Chandrasekaran<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-397.html'>Performance Portable Implementations of Particle-in-Cell Methods</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small>This talk will discuss challenges and success stories while migrating the plasma application, PIConGPU to ORNL Frontier exascale system.

These models have complex interactions between physical phenomena evolving at different scales. Reliability of such multi-physics models remains a grand challenge. When physical phenomena interact, the predictions from such models get polluted and the inherent uncertainties are compounded, thus reducing their reliability. To tackle this problem, we look at a novel approach for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in coupled systems by learning the mathematical operators, called the Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators, that describe the propagation of uncertainties in such models. While scale bridging of multi-scale physics has received considerable attention, UQ of multi-physics remain a challenge. Existing methods for UQ don't quantify the stochastic nature of interaction in multi-physics models. The key scientific contributions of our work is the development of a novel UQ method that 1) quantifies the stochastic nature of coupling, 2) is non-intrusive and, 3) provides both forward and backward UQ in coupled systems. We achieve this by leveraging the Perron-Frobenius and Koopman Operators that act on functions of the model state and describe the evolution of probability densities and observables forward and backward in time respectively.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75476' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1350)' class='star'><span class='star1350'>&star;</span></a> Th&#233;ophile Chaumont-Frelet  <span id='bitlink-2202'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2202)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2202' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2202)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Finite Element Discretizations of Three-Dimensional Time-Harmonic Maxwell's Equations with Two Sign-Changing Coefficients</b><br />Th&#233;ophile Chaumont-Frelet<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-297.html'>Mesh Constraints: From Specific to General Meshes</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>I will consider time-harmonic Maxwell's equations in three-dimensional domains containing metamaterials.

Residual-based a posteriori error estimators for pROMs are usually derived based on a given and known time discretization scheme for the spatially discretized full-order model. However, for many cases (such as stiff systems), the time integration is often performed using black-box solvers (such as ode45 in MATLAB, lsode in Octave, etc.) that use automatic order and step-size control. Such systems pose a challenge for residual-based error estimation of their pROMs since the exact form of the time integration is unknown. To address this, we use machine learning to learn the mismatch between the true value of the residual and the one obtained by imposing a chosen time discretization scheme. Our approach aims at deriving a sharp a posteriori output error estimator for such cases. Using examples from process engineering (batch chromatography) and fluid dynamics (Burgers' equation), we show that our proposed approach is able to more accurately characterize the true output errors of pROMs for systems solved by black-box time integration solvers.	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75309' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1697)' class='star'><span class='star1697'>&star;</span></a> Anthony Chen  <span id='bitlink-2204'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2204)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2204' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2204)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fast Summation on a Sphere</b><br />Anthony Chen<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-375.html'>Presentations by LGBTQ Mathematicians</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>Fast summation techniques have proven to be of great importance in a variety of fields.

In this effort, the initial-value problem (IVP) is converted into a boundary-value problem (BVP) by eliminating time and transforming the system into self-similar coordinates. The self-similar solution to the BVP is then solved using an iterative method embedded in an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework based on the p4est methodology. P4est is a parallel cell-based AMR mesh generation and management software with a 2:1 balancing on computational domains composed of multiple connected two-dimensional quadtrees or three-dimensional octrees. Existing Riemann solvers (e.g., Roe, HLLD, etc.) can be modified in a relatively straightforward manner and used on the present problem. P4est effectively refines the mesh around discontinuities and improves computational efficiency. Extensive numerical tests illustrate that the obtained self-similar solution to the BVP exhibits sharper discontinuities than the corresponding IVP solution. In problems where vortex sheets occur, the self-similar approach results in a well-posed system, when compared with the IVP which experiences convergence loss with mesh refinement.

The Helmholtz problem, widely studied in seismic exploration, is hard to solve both in terms of accuracy and convergence, due to the scalability issues of the numerical solvers. For large-scale applications, high-performance parallel scalable methods are also indispensable. In our method, we use the preconditioned Krylov subspace methods to solve the linear system obtained from finite-difference discretization. The CSLP preconditioner is approximately inverted by one parallel geometric multigrid V-cycle. Motivated by the observation that the eigenvalues of the CSLP-preconditioned system shift towards zero for large wavenumbers, deflation with multigrid vectors and further high-order vectors were incorporated to obtain wave-number-independent convergence. We also compare Galerkin coarsening method and high-order re-discretization on the coarse grid. The matrix-vector products and the inter-grid operations are implemented based on the finite-difference grids without constructing the coefficient matrix. These adjustments lead to direct improvements in terms of memory consumption. Numerical experiments show that wavenumber independence has been obtained for medium wavenumbers. The matrix-free parallel framework shows satisfactory parallel performance and weak scalability.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75511' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(97)' class='star'><span class='star97'>&star;</span></a> Peng Chen  <span id='bitlink-2207'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2207)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2207' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2207)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fast and Scalable Algorithms for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design</b><br />Peng Chen<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-21.html'>Optimal Experimental Design and Robust Optimization for Large-Scale Inverse Problems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) is a principled framework for maximizing information gained from limited data in Bayesian inverse problems.

Recent dimension reduction methods commonly focus on the parameter space, yet many geophysical applications equally necessitate dimension reduction in the data space, which is done in practice through an independent upstream procedure. A recent work [1] con- siders dimension reduction for both data and parameters albeit treating the two spaces separately. However, choosing a low-dimensional informed parameter subspace influences which data subspace is informative and vice versa. We thus propose a coupled dimension reduction method based on the gradient of the generalised forward operator that maps between the parameter and data spaces. Our method computes in an offline phase a projector for a ridge approximation of the likelihood function to accelerate online multi-query pos- terior evaluations. We also show how our method can aid experimental design by localising effective sensor placements. Numerical experiments on a 2D shallow water model illustrate the benefits of our proposed method.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75832' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2074)' class='star'><span class='star2074'>&star;</span></a> Yen-Chen Chen  <span id='bitlink-2209'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2209)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2209' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2209)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Batched Tridiagonal and Banded Solvers on GPUs</b><br />Yen-Chen Chen<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-345.html'>Recent Developments on GPU-Based Solvers in High-Performance Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>GPUs play an essential role in modern numerical computation.

In this work the focus is on developing a digital twin for an electrical machine. Based on the functions of the digital twin, we present the requirements on the simulations that needs to be developed and the main challenges facing the construction of these models. These challenges include real-time simulations, multiphysics coupling, data assimilation and adaptive modeling.    
We present an initial investigation of those challenges by proposing solutions using hierarchical and port-Hamiltonian modeling.  Port-Hamiltonian systems provide a framework that works across different physical domains and different scales and that can help in the development of the digital twin for electrical machines, in particular on the industrial scale. An outlook at potential solutions of the challenges and topics that are still open is also discussed.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75443' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(177)' class='star'><span class='star177'>&star;</span></a> Ashish Cherukuri  <span id='bitlink-2212'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2212)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2212' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2212)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Evolution of Wardrop Equilibria and Braess's Paradox As Demand Varies</b><br />Ashish Cherukuri<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-39.html'>Recent Advances in Stochastic Optimization and Computational Game Theory - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>In this talk we consider routing games with affine cost functions and analyze the evolution of Wardrop equilibria (WE) and the Braess's paradox as the demand increases. Regarding Wardrop equilibria, we show that the computation of such an evolution essentially boils down to solving a finite number of variational inequalities. Such a computation also provides insights on how the travel cost under WE changes as demand increases. In particular, we derive the direction in which this cost will change as the demand increases unboundedly, and leverage this result to find a set of roads which will carry no flow once the demand has increased beyond a certain threshold. Regarding evolution of the Breass's paradox, a phenomenon which occurs when removal of a path from the network counterintuitively decreases the travel cost under equilibrium, we show that if a path displays Braess’s paradox at a particular demand, then it is necessarily beneficial for the network at a lower demand. We also establish that the paradox happens only on a finite interval of demand.

We target a wide combinatory space of elements of the periodic table, which makes a direct study with density-functional theory (DFT) computationally prohibitive. Therefore, we produce a database of DFT-calculated energies on a limited number of SAAs and we apply physics-inspired ML techniques for the extrapolation to a wide range of materials. We use a graph-based Gaussian Process Regression ML model (i.e., WWL-GPR) to calculate adsorption energies [W Xu, et al., Nat Comput Sci 2, 443-450, 2022], and simpler models (e.g., multivariate regressions) to estimate the activation energies of the new materials. We employ microkinetic modeling to simulate the reaction kinetics; then, we apply Sensitivity Analysis and Uncertainty Quantification to identify the parameters that can improve the model predictions, and we refine them with additional DFT calculations. The application of the framework to CO2 hydrogenation allows us to rationalize how reaction mechanisms and catalytic activity change with the catalyst composition, paving the way toward the design and nano-engineering of SAA catalysts.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75497' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(641)' class='star'><span class='star641'>&star;</span></a> Siu Wun Cheung  <span id='bitlink-2214'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2214)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2214' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2214)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Accelerating Hydrodynamics Simulations with Reduced Order Models</b><br />Siu Wun Cheung<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-141.html'>Reduced Order Methods for Geophysical Problems - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Although many model reduction schemes have been developed to reduce the computational cost of simulations while minimizing the error introduced in the reduction process, there are challenges especially in nonlinear advection-dominated problems such as sharp gradients, moving shock fronts, and turbulence, which hinder those model reduction schemes from being practical. In this talk, we consider the time-dependent Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics in a moving Lagrangian frame, and demonstrate some novel techniques to address the challenges imposed by the advection-dominated solutions. Lagrangian hydrodynamics is formulated as a nonlinear problem, which requires a proper hyper-reduction technique to reduce the complexity due to the nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced order models. We will present various hyper-reduction techniques, including over-sampling DEIM and S-OPT. For reducing the Kolmogorov n-width of the solution manifold, we employ a manifold decomposition approach to build local reduced order models in submanifolds. We also present both a posteriori and a priori error bounds associated with the projection-based reduced order model, and the performance comparison of the reduced order modeling approaches in terms of accuracy and speed-up with respect to the corresponding full order model for several numerical examples, namely Sedov blast, Gresho vortices, Taylor-Green vortices, triple-point problem and Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75435' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1358)' class='star'><span class='star1358'>&star;</span></a> Cedric Chevalier  <span id='bitlink-2215'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2215)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2215' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2215)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Continuous Deployment on HPC Clusters Using Spack</b><br />Cedric Chevalier<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-299.html'>Bridging the Gap from HPC Software Engineering to Academic Research - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Installing highly optimized software stacks on specific HPC  architectures is a tenuous task.

Direct solvers, like the Hierarchical Poincaré-Steklov (HPS) method, work by forming a factorization of the system matrix that can be applied to as many right-hand sides or time steps as needed. However, when the mesh changes, the factorization must be completely reformed. The HPS method attempts to solve this by forming a set of solution operators that are built on an adaptive, quadtree structure. The HPS method can achieve linear O(N) factorization performance in 2D and is matrix-free as it does not need to form the system matrix. It also allows for a dynamic update to the solution operators when the mesh changes, solving the so-called “near-by” problem. We present our implementation of the HPS method on quadtree meshes with the p4est software library. We will show results solving Poisson’s equation for eventual coupling with a hyperbolic solver through the ForestClaw software library. In addition, we will present our progress on a parallel implementation on distributed memory architectures.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75740' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(854)' class='star'><span class='star854'>&star;</span></a> Hyeji Choi  <span id='bitlink-2218'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2218)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2218' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2218)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Applications of a Tiled Monte Carlo Algorithm to the Computation of Matrix Functions</b><br />Hyeji Choi<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-186.html'>Matrix-Free Solvers for Large-Scale Applications</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>We extend our prior work on Monte Carlo algorithms for the solution of large linear equations to compute other matrix functions such as exponential and logarithm. One of the only available tools for huge matrices is the Monte Carlo algorithm, which also has the advantage of being able to compute matrix-free, i.e., computing matrix elements as needed, which is essential for truly huge problems for which it is not even possible to store a full vector. To facilitate this latter scenario, we compute the projection of the various matrix functions onto the vector we are interested in with the assumption that we can compute the vector elements also on demand. However, it has been shown that this one-element-at-a-time approach cannot guarantee convergence of the statistical error.  On the other hand, our recent algorithm that computes with matrix tiles can guarantee convergence for sufficiently large tiles. We compute matrix functions by summing a polynomial approximation (e.g., Taylor, Chebyshev, etc.).  We first investigate the convergence conditions for each matrix and provide an expression for the statistical error. Then, we optimize the algorithm in terms of operation time and accuracy by adjusting the parameters such as the tile size and the number of samples for given target error. We also apply variance reduction techniques to reduce the statistical error with the same computational cost. Finally, we show numerical examples from quantum chemistry.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75488' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(52)' class='star'><span class='star52'>&star;</span></a> Sanjay Choudhry  <span id='bitlink-2219'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2219)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2219' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2219)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Nvidia Modulus: A Physics-Ml Framework for Industry Scale Science and Engineering Problems</b><br />Sanjay Choudhry<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-12.html'>Neural Network Solvers for Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>High fidelity simulations are quintessential in the science and engineering domain.

Also, the information gain admits a closed-form expression in the case of linear Gaussian inverse problems. The derivatives of the information gain are extremely challenging to compute. To address this challenge, we present accurate and efficient methods that combine eigenvalue sensitivities and hyper-differential sensitivity analysis that take advantage of adjoint based gradient and Hessian computation. This results in a computational approach whose cost, in number of PDE solves, does not grow upon mesh refinement.

The CHaRMNET team is focused on developing a family of hierarchical approaches for problems in plasmas, related to fusion energy, that leverage novel reduced representations.  CHaRMNET brings together traditional hierarchical models in plasma science, structure preserving algorithms (including structure preserving ML), ML methods for model discovery, blended algorithms that merge ML with traditional scientific computing, ML low rank approximations, sparse-grid approximations, and new algorithms for non-traditional computing platforms. This multi-fidelity multi-model holistic approach to algorithm development is designed to enable new discoveries and is an essential aspect of CHaRMNET’s vision.

Christov<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-266.html'>Computational and Theoretical Advances for Multiphase Flows</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>Suspension flows are notoriously difficult to model due to the variety of fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions that can occur. We propose a new approach based on a two-fluid model (TFM). The TFM can be conveniently implemented in an OpenFOAM® solver to allow industrial-scale simulations, including in curvilinear coordinates. Good agreement is found between TFM simulations and previous experiments on shear-induced particle migration. Heat transfer in dense suspension remains a frontier topic. We propose a closure relation for the inter-phase heat transfer coefficient in the TFM, based on calibration against experimental data. This closure allows us to use the OpenFOAM® solver developed to simulate non-isothermal dense suspension flow in an annular Couette cell. In this context, we identify a novel &#8220;thermo-rheological' migration force, which can oppose (or aid) the well-known shear-induced migration.

The Active Flux method is a finite volume method for hyperbolic conservation laws, previously introduced by Eymann, Roe and coauthors, which uses a continuous, piecewise quadratic reconstruction and Simpson's rule to compute numerical fluxes. While classical finite volume methods only use cell average values of the conserved quantities as degrees of freedom, the Active Flux method uses also point values at grid cell interfaces at the current time as well as at later time levels. These point values together with the cell average value are also used to compute the reconstruction. The resulting method is third order accurate, has a compact stencil in space and time and good stability properties.  We implemented the adaptive Active Flux method as a new solver in ForestClaw, a software for parallel adaptive mesh refinement based on a quadtree approach.

Software metrics are the degree to which a software system possesses some relevant property. Many software metrics are defined as quantitative measurements based on the analysis of source code. Others, such as those being developed by the CHAOSS initiative, focus on measuring the ability of a project to deliver software that meets various criteria, such as community health or development efficiency.    
A key question is how useful software metrics are in improving software quality when applied to development in computational science and engineering, which can differ from software engineering in other areas because of evolving or unclear requirements, deployment to large-scale systems and architectures, and focus on performance.     
I will consider which types of software metric might benefit researcher-developers and research software engineers working in computational science and engineering. Can useful metrics be identified by considering the differences in the way that software is developed these fields?  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75726' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(817)' class='star'><span class='star817'>&star;</span></a> Julianne Chung  <span id='bitlink-2231'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2231)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2231' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2231)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Learning Hyperparameters via Deep Neural Networks for Large-Scale Atmospheric Inverse Modeling</b><br />Julianne Chung<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-179.html'>Uncertainty Quantification for Data-Intensive Inverse Problems and Learning - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Inverse problems arise in a wide variety of applications including biomedicine, environmental sciences, astronomy, and more, but computing reliable solutions to these problems requires the inclusion of prior knowledge, in a process that is often referred to as regularization.  Most regularization techniques require suitable choices of regularization parameters, and in this work, we describe new approaches that use deep neural networks (DNN) to obtain regularization parameters. We consider a supervised learning approach, where multiple networks are trained to approximate mappings from observation data to individual regularization parameters.  Once the networks are trained, regularization parameters for newly obtained data can be computed by efficient forward propagation of the DNNs. The network-obtained regularization parameters can be computed more efficiently and may even lead to more accurate solutions compared to existing regularization parameter selection methods. Numerical results for atmospheric inverse modeling demonstrate the potential of using DNNs to learn regularization parameters.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75478' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(571)' class='star'><span class='star571'>&star;</span></a> Matthias Chung  <span id='bitlink-2232'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2232)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2232' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2232)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Art to Repeatedly Project Your Problems &#8212; The Variable Projected Augmented Lagrangian Method</b><br />Matthias Chung<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-126.html'>Model-Based Optimal Experimental Design - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Inference by means of mathematical modeling from a collection of observations remains a crucial tool for scientific discovery and is ubiquitous in application areas such as signal compression, imaging restoration, and supervised machine learning. With ever-increasing model complexities and growing data size, new specially designed methods are urgently needed to recover meaningful quantities of interest. We consider the broad spectrum of linear inverse problems where the aim is to reconstruct quantities with a sparse representation on some vector space; often solved using the (generalized) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso).  The associated optimization problems have received significant attention, in particular in the early 2000s, because of their connection to compressed sensing and the reconstruction of solutions with favorable sparsity properties using augmented Lagrangians, alternating directions and splitting methods. We provide a new perspective on the underlying l1 regularized inverse problem by exploring the generalized lasso problem through variable projection methods. We arrive at our proposed variable projected augmented Lagrangian (vpal) method. We provide numerical examples demonstrating the computational efficiency for various imaging problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75413' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(111)' class='star'><span class='star111'>&star;</span></a> Valentin Churavy  <span id='bitlink-2233'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2233)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2233' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2233)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tackling Application Portability in Julia</b><br />Valentin Churavy<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-24.html'>Research Software Engineering with Julia - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>In research software engineering we face a plethora of hardware (new and old) that are being used to solve scientific problems at many scales. From the researches new laptop, over institutional resources, to national supercomputers. Scientific applications need to be portable across these architectures, but also exploit specific capabilities of the hardware to reach maximum performance.    
The Julia programming language is a high-level programming language used for technical programming (science, engineering, ...) and many scales. It provides capabilities to program a range of accelerators from different vendors, as well as supporting hardware based reduced precision and vectorization.    
In this talk we will explore the interplay between writing general programs that are specialized by the compiler, using examples from computational fluid dynamics. The two focus topics are (1) the challenge of supporting reduced precision and (2) targeting multiple GPU vendors from a single-source program.

That is, we can observe solution data generated from many physical systems, but the actual physics, e.g. an ordinary or partial differential equation model, are unknown. In this case, developing a deep neural network based model that replicates the system’s behavior is desirable. Hence in this talk, we’ll explore how to learn the time evolution of unknown ODE and PDE systems from their solution data using deep neural networks. The specific neural network architectures used are grounded in numerical methods for solving ODEs and PDEs. We also consider the case of partially observing the solution vector, where a time history of the observed variables are required.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75624' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(605)' class='star'><span class='star605'>&star;</span></a> Simone Ciarella  <span id='bitlink-2235'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2235)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2235' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2235)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Solving the Integro-Differential Equation of Supercooled Liquid Dynamics Using Machine Learning</b><br />Simone Ciarella<br />Monday, February 27 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-132.html'>Recent Advances in Modeling, Simulation, and Sampling via Artificial Intelligence for Physical Sciences and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>We introduce a machine-learning approach to predict the complex non-Markovian dynamics of supercooled liquids from their static averaged quantities. Our method is based on a theoretical framework that uses as input and output system-averaged quantities and descibe the dynamics as an integro-differential equation. Compared to a particle resolved approach, our methd is easier to apply in an experimental context where particle specific information is not available. First, using a deep neural network we predict the self intermediate scattering function of the binary mixtures we investigate. While its performances are excellent when training data across all the temperature range are available, we also show that the model retains some transferability being able to make decent predictions at temperatures lower than the one it was trained for, or when we use it for similar systems. Then, we develop an evolutionary strategy that is able to predict the elusive memory function underlying the integro-differential equation describing the observed dynamics. This method, which is much easier than any Laplace inversion of the memory equation, lets us conclude that the memory function of supercooled liquids can be effectively parameterized as the sum of two stretched exponentials, which physically corresponds to two dominant relaxation modes.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75420' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1450)' class='star'><span class='star1450'>&star;</span></a> Uros Cibej  <span id='bitlink-2236'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2236)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2236' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2236)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structural Analysis of Unsatisfiable Cores for a Combinatorial Problem</b><br />Uros Cibej<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-319.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>Our work deals with the problem of searching for small subsets in the set $[n]=\{1\ldots n\}$ that do not contain any arithmetic triplets (i.e. elements $a,b,c$ (sorted) such that $b-a=c-b$). Furthermore, the set has to be saturated in the sense that if any other number from $[n]$ is added to the subset, it forms an arithmetic triplet with (at least) two other numbers. We are interested in empirically computing the smallest such subset and finding interesting properties in the process. Instead of crafting our solver for this particular problem, we opted to construct an encoding to the SAT problem and use state-of-the-art solvers to solve it. We further explore Minimal Unsatisfiable cores (MUS) to see what interesting properties could be extracted from them. We generated all the MUSes for small $n$ and observe vast differences in the number of MUSes both for different sizes as well as different encodings. These expressions were then transformed into graphs and we explore their structural properties. We emphasize the main differences and connect them with the semantics of the original problem. The main goal was to compute a set of graph properties and see how they behave, and how they change in various contexts. By using common data-exploration techniques we identified interesting patterns and we connect these patterns through the increasing size of the problem. We present the results of this exploration and show the potential of such analysis for other similar problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75715' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1375)' class='star'><span class='star1375'>&star;</span></a> Florina M.

It is codesigned by computational (astrophysicists and cosmologists) and computer scientists (high-performance computing) to achieve scientific advances in astrophysics, cosmology, and high-performance computing, for highly scalable simulations using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. SPH-EXA includes highly optimized and parallelized off-the-shelf hydrodynamics and gravity solvers. It supports new particle types and particle data fields that can be combined with custom-made simulation-derived observable properties and in-situ data analysis.   It requires minimal software dependencies, provides scalable parallelization and communication support, and portability with optimizations for recent CPUs and GPUs.  This design relieves potential users from architectural specifics and performance concerns for scaling up simulations with SPH-EXA.  This talk will describe the SPH-EXA framework, its approach to domain decomposition, parallelization, gravity and hydrodynamics solvers, and their flexible use as pluggable components. A scalable initial conditions generator, test cases and simulations will also be presented.   SPH-EXA is extendable with additional physical effects through the use of propagators, whereby the pluggable framework components are easily customized or implemented from scratch using the provided building blocks in an abstract, efficient and scalable way.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75678' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(59)' class='star'><span class='star59'>&star;</span></a> Jonathan Citrin  <span id='bitlink-2238'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2238)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2238' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2238)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fusion Plasma Turbulence Simulation with Neural Network Surrogate Models</b><br />Jonathan Citrin<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-13.html'>Neural Network Solvers for Differential Equations - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>Accurate predictive modelling of tokamak turbulence is a key component of multiphysics simulation of fusion reactors. Many-query applications such as scenario optimization, experimental design, and controller design, demands both fast and accurate modelling, infeasible with direct numerical simulation. Surrogate models generated with machine learning methods circumvent the conflicting constraints of accuracy and tractability. A key enabling step is the development of reduced-order models, validated by direct numerical simulation. Reduced-order model calculation time is then sufficient for constructing extensive databases of model input-output mappings using HPC resources. These are used as training sets for neural network regression. A key aspect is the physics-informed customization of regression variables and optimization cost functions, to capture known features of the system. The resultant surrogate models accurately reproduce the original reduced-order turbulence model with significant speedup, providing near-realtime capability, 1 trillion times faster than the anchoring direct numerical simulations. We summarize the state-of-the-art in tokamak turbulent transport neural network surrogate development, ranging from practical considerations on label generation, model training, and demonstration applications for scenario optimization at the JET tokamak and extrapolations to the next-generation ITER performance.

We will present in this talk two recent works proposing high accuracy methods to compute the solution based on optimal computational boundary conditions. First, we consider the case of highly oscillatory coefficient fields, putting the problem in the homogenization regime. We will describe a method for computing the homogenised matrix based on representative volume elements with periodic boundary conditions. We will compare two different approches: periodising the realisations versus periodising the law of the coefficients, and explain how the second approach leads to a higher accuracy. This is a joint work with Marc Josien, Felix Otto and Qiang Xu. Second, we will consider the problem of computing the electrical field generated by a charge distribution localized on scale $\ell$ in a situation where the medium is only known in a box of diameter $L>\ell$ around the support of the charge. We study the artificial Dirichlet boundary condition proposed in [Wang, Otto, Ju,Optimal artificial boundary conditions based on second-order correctors for three dimensional random elliptic media] in the case where the medium is a sample from a stationary ensemble with slowly decaying correlations.This is a joint work with Lihan Wang and Quinn Winters.

Our numerical strategy relies on a successive use of two series expansion: a high order Fourier series for the periodic solution finding and a high order Taylor series for the continuation process (the so-called Asymptotic-numerical Method). In order to be able to easily and automatically derive the reduced equations (by collecting term with the same power), the ODE system is augmented with auxiliary variables and equations, so that each equation becomes either a quadratic one or involves only a single transcendental  function (ex: y=exp(x)).  The differentiated form of the transcendental function is also written quadratically (dy= x*dx) for use in the series computation.  The size of the augmented system may be much higher than the one of the original ODE system, but since we use a systematic condensation of the auxiliary variables each time we solve a linear system, this is not a drawback. The last implementation of this strategy makes an intensive use of sparse tensors of order one, two and three, and its computational performances allows to treat moderate size systems obtained by a finite element discretization of a continuous problem.  Various examples ranging from solid vibrations, nonlinear acoustics and fluid-structure interactions will be presented.

In this talk, we will showcase the Cx practices of the Ginkgo sparse  linear algebra framework, which was designed with unit testing, good  software design techniques as well as Cx practices as centerpieces.

Unlike its matrix counterpart, the spectral measure of a self-adjoint operator may have an absolutely continuous component and an associated density function, e.g., in applications posed on unbounded domains. However, there has been no method able to compute spectral measures of general infinite-dimensional self-adjoint operators, with previous efforts focused on classes of operators that carry a lot of structure. The SpecSolve package [Colbrook, Horning, Townsend, SIAM Rev., 63(3) (2021), pp. 489–524] computes spectral measures by combining state-of-the-art adaptive spectral methods with an efficient resolvent-based strategy. By dealing with operators directly, as opposed to previous "discretise-then-solve" techniques, we construct methods with arbitrarily large rates of convergence that recover the spectral measures of general self-adjoint ODEs, PDEs, integral operators and discrete operators. These algorithms are embarrassingly parallelisable. Numerical examples will be given, demonstrating efficiency, and tackling difficult problems taken from mathematics and other fields such as chemistry and physics. A highlight is the computation of hundreds of eigenvalues of Dirac operators to machine precision and without spectral pollution.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75527' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1310)' class='star'><span class='star1310'>&star;</span></a> Gerald Collom  <span id='bitlink-2244'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2244)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2244' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2244)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimizing Hypre Communication with Node Aware Parallelism</b><br />Gerald Collom<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-289.html'>Krylov and Algebraic Multigrid Solvers at ExaScale</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>Hypre is an industry-leading, high-performance solver for sparse system of  equations.

The use of deep learning based surrogate models can accelerate the design phase with close to real-time simulations. In this talk we will focus on deep learning surrogate models for its use in the design of offshore wind turbine support structures with perforations. Here, the development of surrogate model faces three main challenges: first, we have incompressible turbulent flows with transient inflow conditions; second, the geometries resulting from arbitrary number/shape of perforations are complex and mesh generation might be time-consuming; and third, we need surrogate models that are able to deal with non-parametric geometries, e.g. geometries that cannot be parametrized by the same parametric variables used in the training phase. Here we propose surrogate models based on Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for flow over objects with arbitrary geometry together with the use of unfitted Finite Element method, the Shifted Boundary Method, that addresses the three challenges.

By means of 3D fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that turbulence in low-beta plasmas (beta is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) accelerates ions and electrons into a nonthermal energy distribution with a power-law energy range. The ion spectrum is harder than the electron one, and both distributions get steeper for higher beta. We show that the energization of electrons is accompanied by a significant energy-dependent pitch-angle anisotropy, with most electrons moving parallel to the local magnetic field, while ions stay roughly isotropic. We demonstrate that particle injection from the thermal pool occurs in regions of high current density. Parallel electric fields associated with magnetic reconnection are responsible for the initial energy gain of electrons, whereas perpendicular electric fields control the overall energization of ions. Our findings have important implications for the origin of nonthermal particles in space and astrophysical plasmas.

DESC is a newly developed code that computes 3D Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performs PDE constrained optimization of these solutions. DESC solves for equilibria by solving the force balance equation $J \times B = \nabla p$ using a pseudo-spectral method. In tests, it has been shown to be significantly more accurate than legacy codes such as VMEC, particularly near the coordinate singularity at the magnetic axis. DESC is also the first 3D MHD equilibrium code built with automatic differentiation, which allows accurate calculation of the Jacobian matrices at negligible additional cost. These derivatives can then be used for optimizing the solutions to obtain desirable physics and engineering properties. This reduces the computation time by three orders of magnitude in tests compared to the legacy code STELLOPT, and enables exploration over a higher-dimensional parameter space. Examples such as quasisymmetry, metrics for particle confinement, stability, and turbulent fluxes will be shown. DESC also allows novel boundary conditions, which yields understanding on the existence of non-axisymmetric equilibria with nested flux surfaces and reveals their connection to axisymmetric solutions. Examples of these computational advances are demonstrated along with a discussion of the new physics insights they provide.

The coupling takes the form of boundary conditions imposed on the interface relating the solution variables for both models. The multirate aspect arises when numerical time integration is performed with different time step sizes for the components.  We describe a unified approach to develop multirate algorithms for these problems. This effort is pursued though the use of  discontinuous-Galerkin time stepping methods, acting as a general unified framework, with different time step sizes.  The two models are coupled across user-defined intervals of time, called  coupling windows, using polynomials that are continuous on the window.  The coupling method is shown to reproduce the correct interfacial energy dissipation, discrete conservation of fluxes, and asymptotic accuracy.  Also, the method could provide a limit for the total communication needed between components, independent of the number of time steps on a coupling window.  In principle, methods of arbitrary order are possible.  As a preliminary step, we focus on the presentation and analysis of monolithic methods for advection-diffusion models coupled via generalized Robin-type conditions. The monolithic methods could be computed using a Schur-complement approach.  We also discuss some recent progress for partitioned algorithms and different types of coupling conditions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75568' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(370)' class='star'><span class='star370'>&star;</span></a> Emil M.

Solving systems with fine temporal and spatial grid scales is computationally challenging, and closure models are generally difficult to tune. We propose a machine-learning strategy to represent the coarse- to fine-grid map, which can be viewed as subgrid-scale parameterization. Our approach is based on NODEs and partial knowledge of the coarse system; therefore, we learn the source dynamics operator. Our method inherits the advantages of NODEs and can be used to parameterize subgrid scales, approximate coupling operators, and improve the efficiency of low-order solvers. Numerical results are used to illustrate this approach using the two-scale Lorenz 96 equation, the convection-diffusion equation, and the Navier--Stokes equations.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75340' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(614)' class='star'><span class='star614'>&star;</span></a> Paolo Conti  <span id='bitlink-2251'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2251)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2251' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2251)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multi-Fidelity Regression Using Artificial Neural Networks: Efficient Approximation of Parameter-Dependent Output Quantities</b><br />Paolo Conti<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-134.html'>Perspectives on Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>When evaluating quantities of interest that depend on the solutions to differential equations, we inevitably face the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Especially for parametrized, time-dependent problems in engineering computations, it is often the case that acceptable computational budgets limit the availability of high-fidelity, accurate simulation data. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling has emerged as an effective strategy to overcome this difficulty. Its key idea is to leverage many low-fidelity simulation data, less accurate but much faster to compute, to improve the approximations with limited high-fidelity data.    
In this work, we show how to use artificial neural networks (e.g., feedforward neural networks) to tackle multi-fidelity regression problems. A first case deals with a parameter-dependent, stationary Helmholtz problem, where finite element and reduced basis methods are adopted as the high- and low-fidelity models, respectively. We then introduce a novel data-driven framework of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling for parametrized, time-dependent problems using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to enhance output predictions both for unseen parameter values and forward in time simultaneously. Numerical performances are assessed on a variety of engineering problems with high- and low-fidelity data generated through fine versus coarse meshes, small versus large time steps, or finite element full-order versus deep learning reduced-order models.

As such, it is often important to find experimental design conditions that maximize the value of these experiments. Model-based Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) provides a rigorous framework for identifying the ideal design by leveraging a mathematical model that simulates the experimental outcomes. We achieve this by quantifying the value of an experiment using the expected information gain (EIG). This quantity is typically evaluated numerically using a double-nested Monte Carlo (DNMC) estimator. However, DNMC can be prohibitively expensive when using a complex and computationally intensive model. We propose a multi-fidelity approach to accelerate the OED process, in which an ensemble of EIG estimators of varying accuracy and cost (e.g. from lower-fidelity models that use simplified physics, coarsened meshes, or partial convergence) are combined into a single estimator via the approximate control variate method. By leveraging the accuracy-cost tradeoffs of the available models, the multi-fidelity estimator achieves lower variance in estimating the EIG criterion. This approach is demonstrated on a nonlinear benchmark and in designing  turbulent flow experiments for inferring the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence closure model parameters.

In the case of electrostatics, they give rise to a system of partial differential equations where the Poisson and Poisson-Boltzmann equations are coupled on a molecular surface, which interfaces the solute and solvent regions. A boundary-integral approach is a natural choice to simulate such system, as the interface and Dirac delta-like charge distributions are accurately represented. There are a number of Poisson-Boltzmann solvers available that are widely used, however, they fall short in terms of usability in a larger computational workflow, and extensibility to incorporate modifications to the model. In this talk, we will introduce the Poisson-Boltzmann & Jupyter (PB&J) code, a boundary integral solver based on Bempp-cl, designed to be easy to use and extend without sacrificing accuracy or speed. We will review the main design principles and present application examples showing its efficiency in terms of user and computer time. Moreover, this Python-based approach is aligned with current developments in computational chemistry and biophysics, making it possible to integrate into existing computational workflows for multiscale modeling or analysis software, straight from a Jupyter notebook.

For a general (non symmetric) matrix $A$, this can be done by computing the projection of $A$ onto a suitable Krylov subspace. Such projection is usually computed by forming an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace using the Arnoldi method. In this talk, we propose to use non-orthonormal bases of the Krylov subspace, which are faster to construct. Then we use a fast randomized algorithm for least squares problems to compute the projection of $A$ onto the Krylov subspace. We present some numerical examples which show that our proposed algorithms can be faster than the standard Arnoldi method while achieving comparable accuracy.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75153' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(73)' class='star'><span class='star73'>&star;</span></a> Jack Coughlin  <span id='bitlink-2257'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2257)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2257' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2257)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards Efficient Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation of Collisional Kinetic Equations</b><br />Jack Coughlin<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-16.html'>Low-Rank Approximation for Dynamical Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Kinetic equations are of great importance to application areas such as plasma physics and rarefied gas dynamics. In regimes where collisions are very strong, efficient model reductions to hydrodynamic systems can be derived from asymptotic arguments such as the Chapman-Enskog expansion, reducing the dimensionality from 6 to 3. At the same time, dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) algorithms are particularly promising for kinetic equations because of their high dimensionality and the &#8220;tensor-friendly' nature of their terms. However, it is not obvious how to combine the hydrodynamic model reduction approach with dynamical low-rank approximation algorithms, because the zeroth-order solution---the Maxwellian---is not a low-rank function of its arguments. We present a DLRA strategy based on an alternative low-rank decomposition, focusing on a model plasma kinetic equation, which can capture the Maxwellian limit with a very small numerical rank. Our approach yields multiple orders of magnitude speedups on a 2D2V problem, while preserving the system's dynamics across a range of regimes.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75211' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(639)' class='star'><span class='star639'>&star;</span></a> Alvaro Coutinho  <span id='bitlink-2258'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2258)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2258' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2258)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Advanced Training Algorithms for Pinn-Reconstruction of Gravity Currents</b><br />Alvaro Coutinho<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-140.html'>Reduced Order Methods for Geophysical Problems - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Inverse problems in geophysical flows are often ill-posed, thus, it is challenging or sometimes even impossible to solve them using traditional methods. Moreover, the generation of simulated data for ill-posed inverse problems can become very costly where simulation needs to be performed multiple times to either discover missing physics in the model or calibrate the free parameters in the model. One possible alternative for solving these problems is through the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks - PINNs, in which we approximate the problem’s solution using Neural Networks, while incorporating the known data and physical laws during the training phase Here we show a PINN-based framework for reconstructing gravity currents velocity, concentration, and pressure fields  in which the available data can be given in two different ways: a set of scattered measurements for the concentration field, or a set of velocity and concentration measurements that follows the configurations often used in real-life experiments. We discuss PINNs advanced training algorithms aided by optimal sensor placement and dimensionality reduction.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75434' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(379)' class='star'><span class='star379'>&star;</span></a> Steven Crisostomo  <span id='bitlink-2259'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2259)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2259' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2259)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Can the Hartree-Fock Kinetic Energy Exceed the Exact Kinetic Energy?</b><br />Steven Crisostomo<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-84.html'>Recent Advances in Numerical Methods for Electronic Structure Calculations -  Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>The Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation has been an important tool for quantum-chemical calculations since its earliest appearance in the late 1920s, and remains the starting point of most single-reference methods in use today. Intuition suggests that the HF kinetic energy should not exceed the exact kinetic energy, but no proof of this conjecture exists, despite a near century of development. Beginning from a generalized virial theorem derived from scaling considerations, we derive a general expression for the kinetic energy difference that applies to all systems. For any atom or ion this trivially reduces to the well-known result that the total energy is the negative of the kinetic energy and since correlation energies are never positive, proves the conjecture in this case.   Similar considerations apply to molecules at their equilibrium bond lengths. We use highly precise calculations on Hooke's atom (two electrons in a parabolic well) to test the conjecture in a non-trivial case, and to parameterize the difference between density-functional and HF quantities, but find no violations of the conjecture.

In recent years, machine learning came into play in order to analyze traffic data, trying to discover patterns and substitute, when possible, traditional models. Hybrid approaches like the one based on physics-informed neural networks were also proposed.  In this talk we focus on a road segment where traffic flux is continuously counted by means of some fixed sensors. The idea is to couple machine learning and differential models, putting the former at the service of the latter. More precisely, we use a neural network to predict sensor data at the inflow boundary of the road, where the model expects information about the next-to-come traffic flow. Moreover, we use a neural network to detect congestion formations near the sensors. This information is used to recover the car density by inverting the (noninjective) fundamental diagram.  Some examples motivated by real scenarios will be discussed.

I will discuss work on two related approaches to tackle this. One is to embed local, convection-resolving high-resolution models in model columns of a global model, with two-way coupling between them. This is the approach of superparameterization, originally proposed by Grabowski and co-workers. We developed a set-up to apply superparameterization regionally (in selected model columns) rather than globally, thereby making it computationally feasible to use fully 3-d LES for the local models.  In an alternative approach we replaced the local high-res model by a computationally cheap stochastic surrogate model trained on data from the LES or from observations. A discrete Markov chain model was used to this end. We developed a method employing machine-learning assisted resampling to construct a stochastic surrogate, and tested it on the L96 model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75182' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2045)' class='star'><span class='star2045'>&star;</span></a> Rebecca Crossley  <span id='bitlink-2262'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2262)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2262' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2262)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Travelling Waves in a Volume-Filling Model of Cell Invasion into Extracellular Matrix</b><br />Rebecca Crossley<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1427)' class='star'><span class='star1427'>&star;</span></a> Manuel B.

We consider the more recent Kowalski--Piecuch (KP) homotopy from a mathematical point of view and use it  as a theoretical tool to prove the existence of a truncated CC solution. This follows from a more general result guaranteeing the existence of   a whole solution curve of the KP homotopy.

We employ a metriplectic description coined as GENERIC [Oettinger & Grmela, 1997] that ensure conservation of energy in closed systems and non-negative entropy production. In combination with a Graph Neural Network approach, these networks can even impose by construction translational invariance and other symmetries of the studied systems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75421' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(974)' class='star'><span class='star974'>&star;</span></a> Linda Cummings  <span id='bitlink-2266'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2266)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2266' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2266)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Asymptotic Models for Evolving Nematic Liquid Crystal Films</b><br />Linda Cummings<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-213.html'>Recent Advances in Computations and Modeling of Thin Fluid Films - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Asymptotic methods are used to derive a 4th-order nonlinear partial differential equation governing the evolution of a free surface thin film of nematic liquid crystal (NLC) spreading and/or dewetting on a solid substrate. Within a certain temperature range, NLCs behave as anisotropic liquids, with anisotropy imparted by the tendency of the long, rod-like, molecules to align locally. We consider the evolution of "nanoscale" films, of thickness around 100nm, for which van der Waals-type intermolecular interactions between the film and the substrate are important. By implementing an ADI-type numerical method within a GPU computing environment [Lam et al., Computing dynamics of thin films via large scale GPU-based simulations, J. Comp. Phys. X 2, 100001, 2019], we are able to simulate our model efficiently to describe 3D flows on large computational domains (physically, hundreds of microns across) for long times. Comparison of our results with available experimental data shows very good qualitative agreement. We also use our model to investigate the influence of the so-called "anchoring" conditions at the substrate (the preferred orientation of the NLC molecules), and show that it can affect the instability development quite strongly under certain conditions.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2073)' class='star'><span class='star2073'>&star;</span></a> Eleanor Cutcliff  <span id='bitlink-2267'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2267)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2267' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2267)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>6:05-6:20 TBA</b><br />Eleanor Cutcliff<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-425.html'>Student Days: Student Chapter Presentations - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>We are understanding the dynamics of supra-molecular protein coats that promote cargo sorting and transport carrier formation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi complex and trans-Golgi network (TGN).

Optimal experimental design techniques are devised to guide the data acquisition in a way that maximizes the information content in the data about the parameter which is the object of the inversion. In the presence of model error, data additionally must be informative of the model error in order to be able to correct the model and improve model’s predictive power.    
In this talk we present different approaches for treating the model error which exist in the literature on Bayesian inference and optimal experimental design. By applying Lipschitz stability results for Bayesian inverse problems we compare the posterior distributions of the presented approaches with the posterior obtained when the model error is ignored. In this way we are able to quantify the effect of including the model error. Furthermore, we are able to characterize the properties of the observation operator that increase the information content in the data about the model error, thereby increasing the model’s predictive power.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75461' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1474)' class='star'><span class='star1474'>&star;</span></a> Eric C.

The later point implies that there is an upper bound on the strong scaling of these methods. However, recent advances have pursued multilevel approaches that tackle each of these issues independently. Convergence has been accelerated using algorithms based on the Multigrid Optimization (MGOpt) framework. These approaches in combination with a trust-region based search direction can reduce the number of epochs required to train. On the other hand, a Layer-Parallel scheme that applies multigrid-in-time (MGRIT) approaches for both forward and back propagation has shown order of magnitude level parallel speedups for various neural network architectures. The proposed MGOpt algorithm and the MGRIT strategy both use an identical coarsening in time algorithm. This talk will consider leveraging this similarity to improve the parallel performance of the MGOpt approach using a Layer-Parallel decomposition. To demonstrate the performance of this methodology we will apply our approach to standard problems from the deep learning literature.

The core of our approach is that the DA model acts as coarse predictor operator solving the local PDE model, by providing the background values as initial conditions of the local PDE models. To enforce the matching of local solutions on overlapping regions, local problems are modified by adding a correction term keeping track of contributions of adjacent subdomains to overlapping regions. Such a correction term balances localization errors along overlapping regions, acting as a regularization constraint on local solutions. Moreover, in our approach both the coarse and the fine solvers run concurrently from the beginning. Consequently, the resulting algorithm requires only the exchange of boundary conditions between adjacent subdomains. Algorithm scalability is measured in terms of strong scaling  and of weak scaling. A mechanism for dynamically balancing the loads has been included in the parallel framework for solving large-scale DA models. In particular, we refer to the introduction of a dynamic redefining of initial DD in order to deal with problems where the observations are non uniformly distributed and general sparse, a quite common issue in DA.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75574' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1222)' class='star'><span class='star1222'>&star;</span></a> Adel Dabah  <span id='bitlink-2271'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2271)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2271' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2271)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Leveraging Half-Precision in Wireless Communication</b><br />Adel Dabah<br />Thursday, March 2 5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-268.html'>Approximate Computing for Scientific Applications - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output is a crucial technology for Next-Generation networks(Next-G).

In this presentation, we introduce a new GPU-based detection algorithm that demonstrates the positive impact of low-precision arithmetic (FP16, INT16, INT8) and multiple GPUs to achieve next-G latency/scalability/accuracy requirements. Our approach iteratively extends a solution with several symbols representing the best combination out of the aggregated levels. The computation spanning iterations is formulated as a general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) operation to leverage GPU architectures. Preliminary results using A100 GPU show around 2$\times$ time  complexity improvement by exploiting low-precision GEMM arithmetic over the reference FP32 implementation. Our GEMM-based approach turns out to be oblivious to precision loss by reporting similar accuracy using FP32, FP16, and even INT16/INT8 operations.

Dynamic graphs, i.e. graphs that change over time, capture graph structures in dynamical systems. These structures can provide insight into a given problem, whether from a theoretic perspective or for a practical application. Recently, dynamic graphs—in conjunction with machine learning and statistical models—have been used to analyze a wide range of natural data, e.g. human behavior, embryos, animal cohorts, and organism connectomes. In this talk, we will uncover a few basic and important concepts in dynamic graphs and how they can be used for understanding the world around us.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75725' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1240)' class='star'><span class='star1240'>&star;</span></a> Valentin Dallerit  <span id='bitlink-2273'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2273)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2273' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2273)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A New Framework for Easy Derivation of Stiffness-Resilient Exponential Methods</b><br />Valentin Dallerit<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-272.html'>Innovations in Time Integration of Stiff Systems of Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we introduce a new theoretical framework for deriving exponential methods.

In this talk we present a simple kernel-based solution that decomposes the problem as follows:  1) Express the increments of the SDE as a computational graph.  2) Recover the unknown functions through a Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (MAP) estimator with Gaussian Process (GP) priors.  3) Optimize the kernels of the GPs using randomized cross validation.  We illustrate the efficacy, robustness, and scope of our method through numerical examples.

One such application is the use of super-resolution (SR) algorithms to reconstruct small-scale structures from their large-scale counterparts for turbulent flows. To date, all SR algorithms are either supervised, or require unpaired reference data at high-resolution for training. This renders the model inapplicable to practical fluid flow scenarios, where the generation of high-resolution ground truth by resolving all scales down to the Kolmogorov scales becomes prohibitive. Hence, it is imperative to develop physics-guided models exploiting the multi-scale nature of turbulence. Casting SR as an inverse problem, we present a self-supervised workflow based on generative adversarial networks to reconstruct small-scale structures relevant to homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In addition to visual similarity, we assess the quality of the obtained reconstruction using spectra, structure functions, and probability density functions of velocity components and a passive scalar. From the analysis, we infer that the outputs of the workflow are in statistical agreement with the ground truth, which is excluded from the training. Additionally, we observe that the trained network generalizes well across Reynolds numbers. The results from this work lay the foundation to reconstruct small-scale structures from large-eddy simulation data.

Such PDEs naturally arise in a wide range of fields including geology, bio-medicine, and fracture mechanics. Mixed-dimensional models are also used to impose non-standard conditions through Lagrange multipliers. Finite element discretizations of such PDEs involve nested meshes of possibly heterogeneous topological dimension. The assembly of such systems is non-standard and non-trivial, and requires the design of both generic high level software abstractions and lower level algorithms.  The FEniCS project aims at automating the numerical solution of PDE-based models using finite element methods. A core feature is a high-level domain-specific language for finite element spaces and variational forms, close to mathematical syntax. Lately, FEniCS gave way to its successor FEniCSx, including major improvements over the legacy library. An automated framework was developed in core FEniCS legacy libraries to address the challenges characterizing mixed-dimensional problems. These concepts were recently ported to FEniCSx, taking advantage of the underlying upgrades in the library features and design. This talk gives an overview of the abstractions and algorithms involved, and their implementation in the FEniCS project core libraries. The introduced features are illustrated by concrete applications in engineering and biomedicine.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75563' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(520)' class='star'><span class='star520'>&star;</span></a> Scott Dawson  <span id='bitlink-2281'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2281)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2281' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2281)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Time-Localized Resolvent Analysis of Fluid Flows: Numerical Methods and Analytic Approximations</b><br />Scott Dawson<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-114.html'>Reduced-Complexity Models for Fluid Flows - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>This talk will discuss extensions of resolvent analysis that allow for the identification of time-localized forcing and response structures corresponding to high energy amplification. We discuss two methods for enabling such analysis. In the first, the resolvent analysis optimization problem is formulated in a space-time setting, and is then modified to include an L1-norm term to promote temporal sparsity. The resulting optimization problem can be formulated as a nonlinear eigenproblem, which in turn can be solved numerically using a generalized inverse power method. In the second approach, forcing or response modes are assumed to take the form of Gabor wavelets in time, allowing for resolvent gains to be computed as a function of wavelet parameters. We relate the two approaches by demonstrating that temporal wavepackets with this structure (corresponding to Fourier modes modulated by Gaussian envelopes) naturally emerge when applying the sparsity-promoting methodology. We additionally demonstrate that this assumed temporal structure can be analyzed analytically in certain situations. Results from both approaches will be compared for statistically-stationary turbulent channel flow, and for a turbulent Stokes boundary layer, where the mean velocity profile varies with time.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75390' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1520)' class='star'><span class='star1520'>&star;</span></a> Marc Day  <span id='bitlink-2282'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2282)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2282' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2282)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Insights into Compressible Reacting Flows in Complex Geometry Using Adaptive Mesh Refinement Simulations</b><br />Marc Day<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-335.html'>Adaptive Mesh Refinement: Algorithms and Applications - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>With the increased availability of exascale computing hardware, detailed simulations of realistic devices can be performed at practically relevant time and length scales. Insights into the multiscale driving mechanisms in compressible reacting flow systems with complex geometry, such as combustors, can be used for design optimization and technology improvements. However, to effectively perform these simulations, advanced numerical algorithms must be used to maintain solution accuracy without incurring undue computational costs. PeleC, part of  the Pele suite of codes, leverages block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) through the AMReX library to capture fine-scale flow features in compressible reacting flows. In this talk, we discuss recent improvements to the numerical algorithms, particularly in regard to describing flows at complex boundary structures, and PeleC’s performance on exascale computing hardware.

Introduction of a projection-based reduced order model (ROM) for one or more of the sub-models can significantly decrease the on-line computational cost of the system. In this talk, a heterogeneous sub-model case will be considered, having two non-overlapping subdomains. We present a partitioned method that provides for the coupling of a ROM on one subdomain with either a ROM or a full-order model on the other. At the crux of this method is a dual Schur complement system which implicitly expresses a Lagrange multiplier (LM), representing the interfacial flux, in terms of the state variables. In order to ensure the non-singularity of this system, we develop the ROM by creating separate reduced bases for the interior and interfacial degrees of freedom as well as providing a reduction for the LM space. The solution of the Schur complement system and the application of an explicit time-stepping scheme allow for the two subdomain equations to be decoupled and independently solved at each time step. We show numerical results demonstrating the capability of the method to represent each type of coupling.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75410' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(889)' class='star'><span class='star889'>&star;</span></a> Carlo De Falco  <span id='bitlink-2284'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2284)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2284' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2284)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Modelling the Effect of Deep and Shallow Trap States on Polarization and Depolarization of High Voltage Polymeric Insulation</b><br />Carlo De Falco<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-195.html'>Mathematical Problems and Simulations in the Applications of Transport Theory - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>We proposes a model to describe polarization and depolarization currents observed in thin samples of polymeric materials under the application of an electric field of magnitude comparable to the working conditions of HVDC power transmition cables.

The polarization curves are empirically modeled by a power law to account for transport assisted by shallow traps. A simplified model for deep traps with Gaussian distribution of the density of states is proposed to describe the depolarization curves.

We discuss the design of verificarlo  (\url{https://github.com/verificarlo/verificarlo}), an open-source framework to  verify and optimize numerical accuracy in complex programs.  Verificarlo is a  compiler tool built upon the LLVM infrastructure.  It includes  different floating-point backends simulating the effect of numerical errors and  the impact of using lower precision.    
Before lowering precision, one must ensure that the simulation is numerically  correct. In Verificarlo, we rely on alternative floating-point models, such as  Stochastic Rounding, to pinpoint numerical bugs in simulation codes. A  probabilistic definition of the number of significant digits allows us to  estimate the accuracy of a computation.    
Verificarlo can then explore the compromise between precision and performance  through its variable precision backend that simulates lower precisions on  software. It can identify the parts of the code that benefit from smaller  floating-point formats.    
Verificarlo has been applied in HPC codes such as neuroimaging pipelines,  DFT quantum mechanical modeling, or structure  simulations. In particular, we show how Verificarlo was used to optimize  the speed and energy consumption of a deflated conjugate-gradient solver.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75549' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(38)' class='star'><span class='star38'>&star;</span></a> Hans De Sterck  <span id='bitlink-2289'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2289)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2289' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2289)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Speeding Up Nonlinear Iterative Methods with Anderson Acceleration: Asymptotic Convergence Properties</b><br />Hans De Sterck<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-9.html'>Anderson Acceleration and Its Recent Developments</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>We consider Anderson acceleration (AA) with a moving window of size m, and investigate the linear asymptotic convergence behaviour of AA(m) applied to linear and nonlinear fixed-point methods. Anderson acceleration has been shown empirically to be very effective for accelerating nonlinear iterative methods such as alternating algorithms for tensor decomposition or the ADMM optimization method for machine learning, but there is no theory to explain and quantify the asymptotic convergence improvement that is observed in practice.    
We first observe numerically that the root-linear convergence factor of sequences generated by AA(m) strongly depends on the initial condition, and that the acceleration coefficients oscillate while the approximation converges to the fixed point. To shed light on this behaviour, we write AA(m) itself as an augmented fixed-point method and investigate the continuity and differentiability of the fixed-point iteration function and the acceleration coefficients.    
To further investigate AA(m) convergence, we consider the case of accelerating linear fixed-point methods and write AA(m) as a Krylov space method. We obtain polynomial residual update formulas for AA(m) and derive an (m+2)-term recurrence relation for the AA(m) polynomials. This allows us to demonstrate several properties of AA(m). The main question to quantify the asymptotic convergence acceleration provided by AA(m) remains, however, an open problem.

A low-order continuous linear differential system is learned from snapshot solutions of a high-fidelity (HF) solver. The reduced-order model uses different ingredients, such as proper orthogonal decomposition, dynamic mode decomposition and Tikhonov-based robust identification techniques. An interpolation method is used to predict the capsule dynamics for any values of the governing non-dimensional parameters that are not in the training database. Then a dynamical system is built from the predicted solution. Numerical evidence shows the ability of the reduced model to predict the time evolution of the capsule deformation from its initial state, whatever the parameter values. Accuracy and stability properties of the resulting low-order dynamical system are analysed numerically.  The numerical experiments show very good agreement, measured in terms of modified Hausdorff distance between capsule solutions of the full-order and low-order models, in the case of both confined and unconfined flows. This work is a first milestone to move towards real-time simulation of fluid–structure problems, which can be extended to nonlinear low-order systems to account for strong material and flow nonlinearities. We believe that is a valuable innovative approach for deriving an efficient digital twin in this particular context.

The open standard offers portable heterogenenous parallel programming in modern C++. For scientific and engineering simulation and analysis codes, SYCL therefore offers the potential for applications to be performance portable, i.e., for the codes to attain high levels of performance across a range of CPU and GPU devices from different vendors, in a productive way.    
This talk will briefly introduce the key concepts in the SYCL programming model itself, so this minisymposium will be accessible to tall no matter their prior experience of SYCL. Heterogeneous programming models needs to be able to describe the underlying hardware, and enable programmers to write programs which control the location of their data, and the location of computation on that data. I will discuss how these abstractions in the SYCL programming model enable portability and create the potential for performance, and hence strive for performance portabilily. I will finish this talk with a survey of how the current SYCL ecosystem stands with respect to this goal. This will set the stage for this minisymposium, where SYCL will be explored in a wide range of different application areas.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75641' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1534)' class='star'><span class='star1534'>&star;</span></a> Joseph P.

Examples include hybrid discontinuous Galerkin methods, where function spaces defined only over the facets of the mesh are introduced, and problems with boundary or interface conditions enforced by Lagrange multipliers. Solving such problems for real-world applications typically requires large scale simulations to provide sufficient accuracy.    
We present recent developments in the FEniCSx core libraries, inspired by earlier work in FEniCS [C. Daversin-Catty et al., Abstractions and Automated Algorithms for Mixed Domain Finite Element Methods, ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 47, 4, 31], that allows mixed dimensional problems to be solved in an efficient manner. Subdomains, of possibly differing topological dimensions, can be created by specifying a subset of mesh entities, yielding a submesh. Forms can then be assembled involving functions defined over different meshes. The relationships between the meshes can be nested, and high-order geometry is supported. Parallelism and scalability are at the heart of the design philosophy, and code prototyped on a laptop can be deployed on an HPC system without modification.    
We present scaling results for several applications, including hybridised discontinuous Galerkin methods and Lagrange multiplier problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75747' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(514)' class='star'><span class='star514'>&star;</span></a> Charlotte Debus  <span id='bitlink-2294'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2294)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2294' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2294)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Predicting ILU(0) Effectiveness for Sparse Matrix Systems via Explainable Machine Learning</b><br />Charlotte Debus<br />Wednesday, March 1 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-112.html'>Sparse Computations in Science and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Incomplete LU factorization of sparse matrices, which preserves the sparsity pattern of the original system, plays an important role in preconditioning iterative solvers. ILU(0) is a simple yet powerful preconditioner technique for many problems. However, generation of the ILU(0) preconditioner is costly, and it is thus useful to know whether it would be useful for a given problem beforehand. In this work we investigate the feasibility of machine learning techniques to aid in determining whether ILU(0) comprises a suitable preconditioner for a given matrix system. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We train a deep artificial neural network on examples from the SuiteSparse matrix collection to predict the effectiveness of ILU(0) based on meta-features describing the sparsity pattern. 2) Since deep learning approaches require huge amounts of training data, which cannot be provided by real-world matrix systems of appropriate sizes, we further evaluate the possibility of using partial matrices as a synthetic dataset for pretraining the model. 3) Additional insight into which characteristics are crucial for the successful ILU(0) is revealed through explainable machine learning via feature importance evaluation in tree-ensemble approaches. Our results show that ILU(0) effectiveness can be predicted with sufficient accuracy based on a few representative matrix characteristics, and that accuracy for very large matrices improves through learning on partial matrices.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75388' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1053)' class='star'><span class='star1053'>&star;</span></a> Bert J.

Moreover, systems have been increasing in complexity over the past two decades. Accelerators, SoCs, and other configurations are exponentially increasing the diversity of hardware resources. In this talk we will discuss how all these system architecture features should be leveraged to facilitate robust science by moving in new research directions. Specifically, we will outline how system architecture is not an isolated area but must be considered in conjunction with system software; hardware and system software configurations can be voluminous and very detailed in terms of organization; and documenting hardware and system software configurations can also exhibit inconsistencies. We will also present (a) case studies in which, at the execution phase, computation and frequent nondeterminism are not easy to measure, verify, or reproduce, and (b) tentative solutions to these case studies that require engaging the system architecture and system software properties (e.g., by establishing consistent metrics and methods).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75469' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1038)' class='star'><span class='star1038'>&star;</span></a> David Defour  <span id='bitlink-2297'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2297)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2297' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2297)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Interflop: a Project for Interoperable Tools for Computing, Debugging, Validation and Optimization of Floating-Point Programs</b><br />David Defour<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:55 AM&ndash;11:10 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-227.html'>Sustainable Computing with the Help of Tools, Mixed-Precision, and Optimistic Error Estimates</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>The InterFLOP project aims at providing a modular and scalable platform to both analyze and control the costs of floating-point behavior of today's real programs facing those new paradigms (bigger problems, new architectures, new representation formats). The results of existing tools often generate new questions such as: Is this small error guaranteed? May this numerical error occur and how to reduce it? Some more costly analyses bring pieces of answers to these questions, but also require more expertise. In InterFLOP, we propose new analyses and combinations of existing ones to address the challenge of providing a quick and precise numerical diagnosis requiring little user expertise. For that, InterFLOP will collect and combine information on numerical instabilities, catastrophic cancellations, unstable tests, build various statistical analyses of program executions at minimal overhead.    
In this talk, we will describe advances made within the InterFLOP project which aims at 1) enlarging the class of possible applications by considering new front-ends and, therefore, new analyses; 2) providing finer numerical analyses based on formalized composite analyses; 3) verifying the accuracy in the context of precision auto-tuning to make applications more efficient and robust; 4) building statistical analyses tools and help the developer interpret the numerical behavior of program through graphical interpretation.

We consider a networked linear dynamical system with p agents/nodes. We study the problem of learning the underlying graph of interactions/dependencies from observations of the nodal trajectories over a time-interval T. We present a regularized non-casual consistent estimator for this problem and analyze its sample complexity over two regimes:(a) where the interval T consists of n iid observation windows of length T/n (restart and record), and (b) where T is one continuous observation window (consecutive). Using the theory of M-estimators, we show that the estimator recovers the underlying interactions, in either regime, in a time-interval that is logarithmic in the system size p. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to analyze the sample complexity of learning linear dynamical systems driven by unobserved not-white wide-sense stationary (WSS) inputs.

This approach utilizes a solution to a stochastic forward problem (SFP) to update an initial density only in the system input directions informed by the model output data, performing a “selective regularization” that distinguishes it from other common inverse problem methods. The solution to the PIP is defined by the Maximal Updated Density (MUD) point. Data assimilation for reducing variance in MUD points is provided functionally through data-constructed Quantity of Interest (QoI) maps. This work presents recent advancements in MUD point estimation methods and their application to the problem of estimating wind-drag parameters in the state-of-the-art ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) storm-surge model. A novel QoI map that uses Principal Component Analysis on data collected spatio-temporally is introduced. Furthermore, iterative methods are presented where data collected over successive time-windows is used to solve the PIP, using updated densities from prior iterations to inform successive iterations. These methods are used to estimate wind drag coefficients for a simulated extreme weather event near the Shinnecock Inlet located in the Outer Barrier of Long Island, NY, USA.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75478' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1256)' class='star'><span class='star1256'>&star;</span></a> Diego Del-Castillo-Negrete  <span id='bitlink-2302'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2302)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2302' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2302)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Machine Learning Methods for Particle-Based Plasma Computations</b><br />Diego Del-Castillo-Negrete<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-276.html'>Machine Learning for Large-Scale Scientific Data Analysis and Model Simulations - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>The development of accurate and efficient methods for transport computations is critical in magnetically confined plasmas for controlled nuclear fusion.

We present a neural network-based divergence-free (NN-DivFree) interpolation method for arbitrary magnetic field training data points. The method is mesh-free and based on a data-driven reconstruction of the magnetic field using a feedforward neural network. The NN-DivFree method exhibits a significant reduction of the computational complexity compared to local splines while maintaining a small error in the divergence. The second problem is the estimation of the particle density, given the 6-dimensional coordinates of an ensemble of computed particle orbits. To address this problem, we propose the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) which are a family of generative models where both sampling and density evaluation can be efficient and exact. Our method is based on a pseudo-reversible neural network architecture, which improves the estimation by relaxing the invertibility constraint of the nonlinear transformation. Although NF can be computationally inefficiency in very high-dimensional problems, numerical experiments show that this is not the case for the 6-D problem of interest.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75624' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(644)' class='star'><span class='star644'>&star;</span></a> Enrique Delgado  <span id='bitlink-2303'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2303)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2303' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2303)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reduced Basis Method for Stabilized Smagorinsky Models</b><br />Enrique Delgado<br />Thursday, March 2 5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-141.html'>Reduced Order Methods for Geophysical Problems - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>In this work we present the numerical analysis of some Reduced Basis Smagorinsky models.

We construct the reduced velocity space by two different strategies, by considering or not the enrichment of the reduced velocity space with the so-called inner pressure supremizer. We present the development of an a posteriori error estimator for the snapshot selection through a Greedy algorithm, based on the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart (BRR) theory. Moreover, the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM) is considered for the approximation of the non-linear terms.

However, the design resolution is directly linked to the computational time required for the optimization. This is especially true for large-scale applications where a small design resolution is required. For instance, optimizing the structure of TU Delft's Flying V airplane (65 meter wingspan) [F Faggiano, et al., Aerodynamic design of a flying-V aircraft, 2017] with a 10mm resolution requires multiple solutions to linear systems of equations with many billions of unknowns. This presents challenges both regarding memory usage and computation time.    
To address these challenges, we propose a matrix-free linear solver, accelerated with GPUs. Throughout the domain, identical trilinear finite-elements (voxels) are used, thus only one unique element matrix needs to be calculated. Next, sectors of 8×8×8 voxels are used to model the entire geometry of the airplane, preventing redundant computations in regions that are not part of the airplane. Within each sector, regularity of the data is kept, thus ensuring coalesced memory access patterns for a high utilization of GPUs.    
This, together with multigrid preconditioning and multi-GPU strategies, results in the ability to perform extremely large-scale topology optimization at unprecedented speeds. The technique is showcased with optimization of the Flying V airplane.

Some "magic" combinations of odd and even relaxation rates offer good qualitative properties, e.g. placing the point of zero tangential velocity exactly half-way between grid points at no-slip boundaries. We present a reformulation using relaxation rates for forwards- and backwards-propagating distributions. The "magic" combination then sets the forwards-propagating distributions to equilibrium. Applying this approach over three time levels eliminates all non-equilibrium contributions from neighboring grid points. We thus derive closed macroscopic evolution equations over three time levels for the fluid density and velocity alone. These discrete equations are naturally interpreted as discretisations of PDEs with second time derivatives. The evolution equation for velocity decomposes into a momentum conservation law, and a separate stress evolution equation that simulates a linear Maxwell fluid with finite stress relaxation. All other kinetic effects decouple. We also derive closed macroscopic boundary conditions from bounce-back boundary conditions. Numerical experiments with flows driven by oscillating walls, and by vortex dipoles colliding with walls, confirm that solutions computed with the underlying lattice Boltzmann scheme and the closed macroscopic finite difference scheme agree to within round-off error in 128-bit arithmetic.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75437' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(858)' class='star'><span class='star858'>&star;</span></a> Blaise Delmotte  <span id='bitlink-2306'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2306)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2306' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2306)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Large Scale Simulations of Diffusio-Phoretic Suspensions</b><br />Blaise Delmotte<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-188.html'>Numerical Methods for Particle Suspensions and Fluid-Structure Interactions at Small Scales - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>In the last decades catalytic micron-sized particles have been developed to mimic natural micro-swimmers and for engineering applications like drug delivery or water purification. These suspensions of artificial phoretic particles can form coherent structures due to dual hydro-chemical interactions. The numerical modelling of such systems remains particularly challenging given the coupled nature of the chemical and the hydrodynamical problems and the rapid increase in the required computational resources for large ensembles of particles. In this work, we propose a new framework based on the core ideas of the Force Coupling Method, able to handle both the chemical reaction-diffusion and Stokes flow problems for a large number of particles (Diffusio-phoretic Force Coupling Method). We implement this method in an efficient parallel solver, in order to model the collective motion of diffusio-phoretic suspensions made of Janus particles. We will show how the  macroscopic behaviours emergent in these suspensions strongly depend on the chemical surface properties of the individual particles.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75491' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(966)' class='star'><span class='star966'>&star;</span></a> Laurent Demanet  <span id='bitlink-2307'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2307)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2307' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2307)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Symmetric Auto-Encoders for Disentangling Path vs Source Effects in Wave Propagation</b><br />Laurent Demanet<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-211.html'>Computational Challenges in Wave Theory: Methods and Applications - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75522' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1056)' class='star'><span class='star1056'>&star;</span></a> Nicola Demo  <span id='bitlink-2308'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2308)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2308' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2308)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Real-Time Modeling Through Neural Networks: Challenges and Perspectives</b><br />Nicola Demo<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-231.html'>Accelerating Computational Science and Engineering via Data-Driven Learning and Nonlinear Model Reduction - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>in the last years, the exponential diffusion of machine learning algorithms has contributed to improve already consolidated procedure, as well as allowing the creation of new frameworks, also in the field of data-driven and reduced order modeling. In particular, the neural networks, thanks to their approximation capability, have enabled the treatment of complex nonlinear models, maintaining a very limited computational cost during the inference of these models.  In this contribution, we present some of the enhancements obtained by employing neural networks to overcome the limitations of standard technique like 1) an automatic snapshots shifting to solve the weakness of proper orthogonal decomposition in advection-dominated problems, 2) a multi-fidelity approach to improve the accuracy of a generic data-driven reduced order model and 3) the development of continuous convolutional filter to reduce the  dimensionality with unstructured data.

Hence, compact modeling is required. However, many challenges arise when dealing with nonlinearities. Typically, commercial FEM code does not allow the user to extract the operators describing the dynamics. Instead, only solution trajectories are available. As a result, nonlinear model reduction is often achieved using data-driven techniques. However, complex physical characteristics are usually not preserved with solely data-based approaches. Therefore, in this work a hybrid operator inference-based approach is proposed which combines both physics-based and data-based techniques. With this approach, it is demonstrated how nonlinear material properties of thermo-mechanical systems can be efficiently reproduced in a reduced-order model.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75252' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(20)' class='star'><span class='star20'>&star;</span></a> Leif Denby  <span id='bitlink-2310'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2310)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2310' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2310)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Properties and Transitions of Mesoscale Convective Organisation During EUREC4A Using Unsupervised Learning</b><br />Leif Denby<br />Thursday, March 2 5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-4.html'>Understanding Cloud Physics Using Stochastic, Dynamical, and Data-Driven Modeling - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>The representation of shallow tradewind cumulus clouds in climate models  accounts for the majority of inter-model spread in climate projections,  highlighting an urgent need to understand these clouds better.

The precise mechanisms driving different  forms of convective organisation which arise both in nature and in simulations  are, however, currently unknown.    
Using unsupervised learning for identifying regimes of convective organisation  in the tropical Atlantic, we will show results from analysing: a) what the  radiative properties of different forms of organisation are, b) what  atmospheric characteristics coincide with different forms of organisation  and c) what transitions occur when following air-masses along Lagrangian  trajectories.  Specifically, we find: a) net radiation changes significantly  between different forms of organisation, b) agreement with previous studies on the  importance of boundary layer wind-speed and to some degree atmospheric  stability, and c) we are able to succinctly capture what transitions occur  between regimes.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75183' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1869)' class='star'><span class='star1869'>&star;</span></a> Shaozhong Deng  <span id='bitlink-2311'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2311)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2311' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2311)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Eulerian Algorithms for Computing the Forward Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent Without Finite Difference Upon the Flow Map</b><br />Shaozhong Deng<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1346)' class='star'><span class='star1346'>&star;</span></a> Xiaolong Deng  <span id='bitlink-2312'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2312)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2312' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2312)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deploying a Tensor Network Simulator on Modern HPC Architectures</b><br />Xiaolong Deng<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-296.html'>Computational Aspects of Tensor Networks - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>We present QXTools, a framework for simulating quantum circuits using tensor network methods.

Examples in this setting would be reactive porous-media flow and biomechanical models of human organs. We present a novel software framework to couple existing micro-scale and macro-scale simulations in a black-box fashion. We develop a software component which manages a set of micro simulations, and couples them to the macro simulation through the coupling library preCICE.  The broad aim is to develop macro-micro coupling methods and software that are independent not only of the concrete multiscale application but also of the used macro-scale and micro-scale software. While reusing key coupling implementations of preCICE (e.g., parallel communication and fixed-point acceleration schemes), we present a new software component called Micro Manager. The Micro Manager calls all micro-scale simulations as libraries in an adaptive manner and is itself coupled to the macro-scale simulation using preCICE.  The working of the Micro Manager is demonstrated using a two-scale heat conduction scenario in porous-media. In this case, each micro simulation consists of a grain structure which evolves depending on the temperature at the corresponding macro location. The effective thermal conductivity and material amounts at each macro point is computed by resolving a micro simulation. The micro simulations are run in an adaptive manner based on a similarity criterion.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75279' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(513)' class='star'><span class='star513'>&star;</span></a> Aditya Devarakonda  <span id='bitlink-2316'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2316)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2316' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2316)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>2D S-Step Methods for Machine Learning</b><br />Aditya Devarakonda<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-112.html'>Sparse Computations in Science and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most widely used optimization methods for solving various machine learning problems. SGD solves an optimization problem by iteratively sampling a few data points from the input data, computing gradients for the selected data points, and updating the solution.

We introduce an s-step SGD algorithm which adapts the s-step technique from Krylov methods to re-organize the SGD computations into a form that communicates every s iterations instead of every iteration, where s is a tuning parameter. Furthermore, we develop 2D distributed-memory variants of the s-step SGD algorithm by leveraging existing work on 2D sparse matrix kernels and combining 1D s-step SGD with other existing SGD variants such as divide and conquer SGD and asynchronous SGD.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75388' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1584)' class='star'><span class='star1584'>&star;</span></a> Stephen DeWitt  <span id='bitlink-2317'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2317)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2317' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2317)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Assimilation of in-Situ Thermal Observations into Component-Scale Additive Manufacturing Simulations to Improve Thermal State and Model Parameter Estimates</b><br />Stephen DeWitt<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-350.html'>Advances in Computational Modeling  for Additive Manufacturing - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Through controlled deposition of heat and mass, additive manufacturing offers the potential for complex component shapes and location-specific material properties. A downside of the flexibility in the geometry and the heat input into the system, however, is that thermal evolution is complex with rapid variation across the component. This thermal evolution is critical in determining factors such as the final microstructure in the component as well as the residual stress. Here we present a new approach for estimating the temperature throughout an additively manufactured component as it is being built. We combine a GPU-accelerated finite element thermal solver with in-situ infrared imaging and thermocouple data using an ensemble Kalman filtering approach with localization. We also explore augmenting the filtered state with model parameters (e.g. laser absorptivity, thermal diffusivity) to learn the values of those parameters that are most consistent with observations. Using synthetic observations where the ground truth is known, we demonstrate improved temperature estimates in the interior of the component using data assimilation, especially with the parameter-augmented approach.

These UQ problems are often posed in terms of parameterized partial differential equations whose solutions take values in Hilbert or Banach spaces. Impressive results have been achieved on such problems with deep learning (DL), i.e. machine learning with deep neural networks (DNN). This work focuses on approximating high-dimensional smooth functions taking values in reflexive and typically infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Our novel approach to this problem is fully algorithmic, combining DL, compressed sensing (CS), orthogonal polynomials, and finite element discretization. We present a full theoretical analysis for DNN approximation with explicit guarantees on the error and sample complexity, and a clear accounting of all sources of error. We also provide numerical experiments showing that DNNs can produce accurate approximations on challenging Banach-valued benchmark problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75624' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1207)' class='star'><span class='star1207'>&star;</span></a> Rahul Dhopeshwar  <span id='bitlink-2319'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2319)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2319' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2319)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Non-Intrusive Model Order Reduction for Nonlinear Coupled Problems</b><br />Rahul Dhopeshwar<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-265.html'>Bridging Numerical Analysis and Machine Learning - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>We are interested in thermo-electro-mechanical problems arising in applications like curing process and spark plasma sintering. These models consists of non-linear material models like viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity. High-fidelity simulations of such coupled multiphysics problems are prohibitively expensive for performing parametric studies, optimization, control or estimation. In order to solve such problems, accelerating the forward model solves by means of efficient reduced order models is necessary. However, developing ROMs addressing these non-linearities is challenging due to the history dependence and presence of internal variables.    
To address this, hyper-reduction techniques have been used in the literature to construct reduced order models for non-linear problems. In particular, Reduced Basis - Empirical Quadrature Procedure (RB-EQP) has been used for hyperelasticity problems. RB-EQP has been shown to provide offline efficiency by reducing the number of integration points and the required full-order solves which can be very expensive to compute. Furthermore, methods in scientific machine learning have demonstrated online efficiency by avoiding expensive assembly of the reduced nonlinear problem. Exploiting these advantages of hyper-reduction and ML methods, we propose a unified numerical framework for an offline and online efficient non-intrusive ROM technique. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on a macroscale sintering problem.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75605' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1890)' class='star'><span class='star1890'>&star;</span></a> Daniele Di Lorenzo  <span id='bitlink-2320'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2320)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2320' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2320)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Models Correction Based on Sparse Identification and Data Assimilation</b><br />Daniele Di Lorenzo<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1338)' class='star'><span class='star1338'>&star;</span></a> Edoardo Di Napoli  <span id='bitlink-2321'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2321)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2321' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2321)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High-Performance Computing in Tensor Networks: the Current Status and the Challenges Ahead</b><br />Edoardo Di Napoli<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-295.html'>Computational Aspects of Tensor Networks - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>Numerical techniques based on tensor networks has been used in the past twenty years to tackle problems in quantum many-body physics.

SZ offers different types of error controls such as absolute error bound, relative error bound and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). SZ supports diverse execution environments including CPU, openMP and GPU. SZ has been integrated in multiple I/O libraries such as HDF5 and ADIOS, as well as various scientific packages such as cosmology simulation package. SZ is a modular composable framework allowing users to customize different compression pipelines according to specific requirement or data characteristics.

However, for so-called "extreme-scale" problems, the storage of such high-dimensional FOM simulation data renders ROM training infeasible. Domain-decomposition (DD) alleviates this issue by solving the FOM on smaller subdomains, thereby generating training data of more manageable sizes. Model reduction can then be applied to each subdomain, and the separate ROMs can be reassembled to compute a global ROM for the DD FOM. A promising model reduction approach for the DD problem is the so-called nonlinear-manifold ROM (NM-ROM). NM-ROM has provided improved accuracy over linear-subspace ROMs (LS-ROMs), particularly for advection-dominated problems. NM-ROM approximates the FOM state in a nonlinear-manifold, which is learned from training a shallow, sparse-masked autoencoder using the FOM simulation data. The shallow, sparse architecture of the autoencoder allows for hyper-reduction to be applied, yielding computational speedup. In this talk, the DD formulation of the FOM and the application of NM-ROM to each subdomain are discussed. The results of the DD NM-ROM approach with hyper-reduction are numerically compared to DD LS-ROM with hyper-reduction for the 2D steady-state Burgers' Equation.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75415' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(616)' class='star'><span class='star616'>&star;</span></a> Felix Dietrich  <span id='bitlink-2326'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2326)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2326' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2326)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Approximation of Response Surfaces from Partial Information</b><br />Felix Dietrich<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-135.html'>Perspectives on Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>We discuss how to use dimension reduction methods to organize unstructured ensembles of partial observations of a system’s response surface. We assume to have no knowledge about where on the surface the observations are obtained. We do, however, record measurements not only at the point of observation, but also in its immediate vicinity. We demonstrate how such partial and disorganized observation ensembles can be integrated into coherent response surfaces whose dimension and parametrization can be systematically recovered in a data-driven fashion. The approach can be justified through the Whitney and Takens embedding theorems. We demonstrate our approach by organizing unstructured observations of a cusp bifurcation surface for Hydrogen combustion in a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor. Finally, we discuss more generally which adjustments to common measurement procedures are necessary to obtain useful reconstructions.

It is a significant safety concern for the aeronautic industry since it can lead to dramatic events. HAIC and recently MUSIC-haic models are developed in CEDRE solver, an ONERA's CFD code, to help the aeronautic industry to assess ice crystal icing on new products and future generations of aircraft engines and meet certification requirements.   This study considers the numerical simulation of ice crystal trajectories around an airplane fuselage nose. First, the aerodynamics airflow field is investigated. Then, trajectories and the associated fragmentation dynamics on walls are considered. Numerical simulation with a full deposition model is compared to numerical simulations with two different fragmentation models: HAIC and MUSIC-haic models. The comparison between the fragmentation models aims at assessing the capabilities of the recently proposed ice crystal fragmentation model (MUSIC-haic) with respect to the state-of-the-art model (HAIC). Both models show significant deviation from the full deposition model, therefore stating the relative importance of particle fragmentation on particle concentration along the fuselage nose. Although the two fragmentation models show some agreement, they also exhibit a large discrepancy in the fragmentation process.   	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75514' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1662)' class='star'><span class='star1662'>&star;</span></a> Simon Dirckx  <span id='bitlink-2329'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2329)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2329' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2329)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Frequency Sweep for the Helmholtz Equation: Preconditioning and Efficient Solves</b><br />Simon Dirckx<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-368.html'>Boundary Integral Equations, Boundary Element Methods, and Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>Boundary integral equation discretizations for the scalar Helmholtz equation lead to large dense linear systems. Efficient boundary element method (BEM) solvers, such as the fast multipole method (FMM) and H-matrix based methods, focus on structured low-rank approximations of subblocks in these systems. The ranks of these subblocks increase linearly with the wavenumber. Recently, in [S. Dirckx, D. Huybrechs & K. Meerbergen, &#8220;Frequency extraction for BEM-matrices arising from the 3D scalar Helmholtz equation", (to appear in SISC)], we explored a data compact representation of the wavenumber dependence of these BEM matrices, based on a technique called `frequency extraction'. This allows for the efficient, quadrature-free construction of all relevant BEM-matrices in a pre-selected wavenumber range. Now we explore preconditioning techniques and efficient frequency sweeps. The preconditioning is two-fold. Firstly, we can generate so-called `operator preconditioners' quadrature-free from our data-compact representation, resulting in mesh-independent condition numbers of the BEM-systems. Secondly, Krylov subspace recycling is used to accelerate convergence of iterative solvers (e.g. GMRES), by collecting strategically chosen deflation subspaces. Our data-compact representation is augmented by these deflation spaces, and can then be used to accelerate solves at arbitrary wavenumbers in the selected range.

Practical applications often demand accurate and computationally fast methods able to predict such behaviors, which can be achieved through Domain Decomposition (DD) and Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques.  However, simulations of the coupled model may be unfeasible, as it might not be a-priori available or its computational cost is too large.   Thus, in this work we propose two MOR techniques that construct local independent surrogate models, whose interaction accurately predicts the solution of a given coupled system.  The offline phase is based on a suitable parametrization of the interface data, whereas the online phase combines the reduced models using ideas from DD methods.  We show their potential in terms of accuracy and computational performance in different test cases, including nonlinear and multi-physics problems.

Variance reduction approaches are critically needed to reduce the cost of analysis in computationally expensive models. By using multiple models of varying fidelity, a control variate estimator can significantly reduce the variance of an estimator for one QoI using the correlation between the models. However, with many QoIs, a vast majority of approaches use multiple independent control variate estimators for each QoI.  In this talk, we develop a multi-output approximate control variate estimator and show that it outperforms a set of multiple single-output control variate estimators. Overall, it significantly reduces the cost of analysis by additionally extracting correlations amongst multiple model outputs. We demonstrate our technique on applications in flight trajectory estimation in simulations of entry, descent, and landing. Also, using highly correlated QoIs, examples will be shown that significantly surpass current state-of-the-art techniques.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75248' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(930)' class='star'><span class='star930'>&star;</span></a> Vladimir Djordjic  <span id='bitlink-2332'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2332)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2332' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2332)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>14 and 17 Moments Systems for Polytropic Gases - Comparison Regarding Transport Coefficients</b><br />Vladimir Djordjic<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-203.html'>Multiscale Methods for Kinetic Models: Theory and Numerics - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we will consider the kinetic model of continuous type describing a polyatomic gas[Bourgat et al,1994;Desvillettes et al.,2005]. Such a model introduces a single continuous variable supposed to capture all the phenomena related to the more complex structure of a polyatomic molecule.    
 We then focus on the kinetic model for which the rigorous existence and uniqueness result in the space homogeneous case is recently proven[Gamba and Pavic-Colic,2020]. Using extended version of the cross-section proposed in that analysis we establish macroscopic models of fourteen and seventeen fields. In addition, the model introduces frozen collisions when a polyatomic molecule behaves as a monatomic one[Djordjic et al.,2021]. For the fourteen and seventeen moments model, using the publicly available computer algebra code [Djordjic et al.,2021], we compute relaxation times and transport coefficients such as shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity as well as its ratio - the Prandtl number. Next, we examine differences in transport coefficients from these two moments systems and find equivalence for the specific choice of parameters from the cross-section model. However, we expect that with an increasing number of moments the transport coefficients will converge for all possible parameter choices in the cross-section.

Dendrites, tree-like branched structures, are the most common microstructure in the solidification processing of metals. The microstructure evolution directly controls the properties of solidified material. Therefore, understanding dendritic solidification plays a crucial role in the quality assurance of the solidified product. The phase-field method represents the preferred technique for predicting dendritic microstructure under various casting conditions. The strong-form meshless methods turn out to be very suitable for solving phase-field models for dendritic growth. The solution of these models is prone to mesh-induced anisotropy, which can be in the meshless methods straightforwardly circumvented by using scattered node distributions. In the present contribution, the radial basis function generated finite difference method and the diffuse approximate method are tested on regular and scattered node distributions. The emphasis is given to the analysis of the growth in arbitrary preferential growth directions. The influence of node distribution type on the accuracy is thoroughly analysed for both methods. Additionally, a space-time adaptive algorithm developed to accelerate meshless calculations is presented. The algorithm dynamically ensures the highest density of computational nodes and the finest time-stepping at the solid-liquid interface.

It is well known that this equation has important time invariants such as the total energy of the system. Preserving the energy under numerical discretization can be of great significance in many practical situations. In this talk we consider numerical approximations of the GPE based on multiscale approaches. More precise, we choose a generalized finite element space which is based on the localised orthogonal decomposition method and which allows to capture the energy with a 6th order accuracy. Paired with energy-preserving time integrators we demonstrate how such an approach can lead to an efficient solver for the GPE and so for simulating the dynamics of BECs on larger time scales.

We approximate the optimal importance distribution in a general importance sampling problem as the pushforward of a reference distribution under a composition of order-preserving transformations, in which each transformation is formed by a squared tensor-train decomposition of a ratio of unnormalized bridging density functions, such as tempered or smoothed versions of the target density. The use of composition of maps moving along a sequence of bridging densities alleviates the difficulty of directly approximating a concentrated target density function. To compute expectations over unnormalized probability distributions, we design a ratio estimator that estimates the normalizing constant using a separate importance distribution, again constructed via a composition of transformations in tensor-train format. This offers better theoretical variance reduction compared with self-normalized importance sampling, and thus opens the door to efficient computation of rare event probabilities in Bayesian inference problems. Numerical experiments on problems constrained by differential equations show little to no increase in the computational complexity with the event probability going to zero.

Unlike solving a linearized system that assumes infinitesimal perturbations around a base state, this framework considers nonlinear sensitivity equations (NLSE) for finite perturbations. To solve the NLSE, we propose a low-rank approximation that leverages a time-dependent basis by extracting correlations between sensitivities on-the-fly. To this end, we derive forward low-rank evolution equations for an orthonormal state basis, correlation matrix, and orthonormal parametric basis. The resulting equations are Jacobian-free and leverage the same nonlinear solver that is used to compute the evolution of the base state. To enable efficient computation of the low-rank equations, we employ a rank-adaptive sparse sampling strategy. This strategy constructs a low-rank approximation for the right hand side of the NLSE via the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Not only does this approach reduce the computational cost, it is significantly less intrusive as it does not require implementing the reduced operators term by term. For nonlinear sensitivities with arbitrarily time dependent base state, we demonstrate that low-rank structure often exists, and can be extracted in real time by solving evolution equations. We consider two case studies: (i) 2D compressible flow and (ii) species transport in a turbulent reacting flow.

Our spectrally-accurate Stokes solver uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in the periodic $xy$ plane and Chebyshev polynomials in the aperiodic $z$ direction normal to the wall(s). We decompose the problem into a doubly-periodic subproblem in the presence of particles (source terms) with free-space boundary conditions in the $z$ direction, which we solve by borrowing ideas from a recent method for rapid evaluation of electrostatic interactions in doubly-periodic geometries [Maxian et al., J. Chem. Phys., 154, 204107, 2021], and a correction subproblem to impose the boundary conditions on the wall(s). Instead of the traditional Gaussian kernel, we use the exponential of a semicircle kernel to model the source terms (body force) due to the presence of particles, and provide optimum values for the kernel parameters that ensure a given hydrodynamic radius with at least two digits of accuracy and rotational and translational invariance. The computation time of our solver, which is implemented in graphical processing units, scales linearly with the number of particles, and allows computations with about a million of particles in less than a second for a sedimented layer of colloidal microrollers.

The EIG is typically approximated through a double-nested Monte Carlo estimators, requiring $O(N^2)$ forward model evaluations. This becomes prohibitive when working with computationally intensive models commonly encountered in studies of complex and physical systems. Recently, Foster et al. proposed a variational EIG approximation technique that requires only $O(N)$ forward model evaluations, by maximizing a stochastic lower bound of the EIG that emerges from replacing the true posterior with a Gaussian variational distribution. However, Gaussian distributions are unable to capture non-Gaussian posterior behavior such as multi-modality and skewness, and it can lead to large bias (loose bound) in estimating the EIG. We improve the variational OED by deploying normalizing flows that transform standard normal latent variables to general non-Gaussian distributions through expressive neural networks, leading to lower bias estimators as well as an ability to produce accurate non-Gaussian posteriors. We illustrate this method on benchmark problems as well an application to design optimal observing times for inferring parameters of an aphid population model.

In particular, our analysis allows for curved element shapes without the use of non-linear elemental maps. The feasibility of the method relies on the definition of a suitable choice of discontinuity penalization, which turns out to be explicitly dependent on the particular element shape but essentially independent of small shape variations. This is achieved upon proving extensions of classical trace and Markov-type inverse estimates to arbitrary element shapes. A further new $H^1$ - $L_2$-type inverse estimate on essentially arbitrary element shapes enables the proof of inf-sup stability of the method in a streamline-diffusion-like norm. These inverse estimates may be of independent interest. A priori error bounds for the resulting method are given under very mild structural assumptions restricting the magnitude of the local curvature of element boundaries. Numerical experiments are also presented, indicating the practicality of the proposed approach.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75652' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1466)' class='star'><span class='star1466'>&star;</span></a> Olga Dorabiala  <span id='bitlink-2348'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2348)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2348' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2348)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Spatio-Temporal K-Means</b><br />Olga Dorabiala<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-322.html'>Geometry and Shape Analysis for Neuroscience: Methods in Geometry and Shape Analysis - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>Spatio-temporal data is readily available due to technologies, such as GPS and IOT, that track the positions of moving objects of interest. Many spatio-temporal clustering methods exist to efficiently discover patterns in moving object behavior without human supervision. Our focus is the discovery of moving clusters, where clusters have a static identity, but their location and content can change over time. It is informative to know both which individuals associate at every time step, as well as in the long-term. We propose a two phase spatio-temporal clustering method, spatio-temporal k-means (STKM), to analyze the multi-scale relationships within spatio-temporal data. Phase 1 of STKM outputs the temporary associations between objects. The clustering objective function provides a unified formulation over space and time and less parameter tuning compared to existing methods. Phase 1 also tracks cluster paths without any post-processing, allowing it to identify long-term point behavior even in a dynamic environment. Phase 2 can be optionally applied to output the stable associations between objects. The combination of both phases allows us to analyze the interaction of short- and long-term point behavior.

Using a finite number of data samples from the unknown system, our proposed algorithm uses a behavioral systems theory approach to learn a non-parametric system model used to predict future trajectories. We show that, in the case of deterministic linear time-invariant systems, the DeePC algorithm is equivalent to the widely adopted Model Predictive Control (MPC), but it generally outperforms subsequent system identification and model-based control. To cope with nonlinear and stochastic systems, we propose salient regularizations to the DeePC algorithm. Using techniques from (distributionally) robust stochastic optimization, we prove that these regularization indeed robustify DeePC against corrupted data. We illustrate our results with nonlinear and noisy simulations and experiments from power electronics and power systems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75573' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1295)' class='star'><span class='star1295'>&star;</span></a> Ravil Dorozhinskii  <span id='bitlink-2350'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2350)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2350' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2350)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Performance-Portable Earthquake Simulation with SeisSol and SYCL</b><br />Ravil Dorozhinskii<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-285.html'>SYCL's Impact on Algorithms, Data Structures and Implementations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>SeisSol is a high-performance simulation package for large-scale simulation of earthquakes and seismic phenomena.

Such a phenomenon, responsible for stability loss and structure destruction, is commonly explained by the so-called flutter equation aggregating the structural dynamics, the aerodynamic forces and the actuators forces. Such a coupling leads to the following flexible aircraft model description:  $$  (s^2 M + s D  + K ) x = Q(s_i,\rho_j) x + B u \text{ and } y = Cx,  $$  blending a structural dynamics ($M,D,K$) and the so-called generalized aeroelastic forces ($Q(s_i,\rho_j)$). More in details, $M,D,K$ and $B,C$ are real-valued matrices while $Q(s_i,p_j)$ is a complex-valued  matrix known at frozen complex $s_i$ values (usually on the imaginary axis) and real parameter $\rho_j$ values (function of the flight configuration).     
Some challenges are to evaluate the flutter instability occurence via the frequency/parameter couple, and second, to prevent it by monitoring the critical damping value.     
To address both objectives, SISO and MIMO parametric reduced order models are first constructed using the Loewner framework. These latter are then used to design a flutter detection mechanism involving nonlinear observers.

For a sequence of snapshot vectors $\mathbf{f}_1,\mathbf{f}_2,\dots, \mathbf{f}_{m+1}$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, assumed driven by a linear operator $\mathbb{A}$, $\mathbf{f}_{i+1}=\mathbb{A} \mathbf{f}_i$, the goal is to represent the snapshots in terms of the computed eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\mathbb{A}$. We can think of $\mathbb{A}$ as a discretization of the underlying physics that drives the measured $\mathbf{f}_i$'s.  In a pure data driven setting we have no access to $\mathbb{A}$. Instead, the $\mathbf{f}_i$'s are the results of measurements, or e.g. $\mathbb{A}$ represents PDE/ODE solver (software toolbox) that generates solution in high resolution, with given initial condition $\mathbf{f}_1$.  In this talk, we present recent development  of numerically robust computational tools (numerical methods with analysis and robust software implementation) for dynamic mode decomposition and data driven Koopman spectral analysis.   This includes new implementation of the DMD and an improved methods for nonlinear system identification in data driven setting.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75572' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(243)' class='star'><span class='star243'>&star;</span></a> Derek A.

One such set of structures, called Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS), are of particular interest. LCSs serve as a "skeleton" of a fluid flow, as they describe the regions of maximal attraction, repulsion, and shearing of a flow. Typically these structures are used to qualitatively analyze flow behavior. However, one may wish for these structures to appear in specific regions of a flow, as a means of flow control. Specifically, we are interested in the following problem: can we introduce a flow obstruction to guarantee a specified LCS. In this talk, we will discuss the feasibility of this problem, whether or not solutions to this problem exist, and how we may go about solving it both analytically and numerically.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75279' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(121)' class='star'><span class='star121'>&star;</span></a> Vladimir L.

One specifics of this approach is that it requires  the full square   multiple-output/multiple-input (MIMO) matrix valued transfer function as the data for the multidimensional problems.  The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) however is limited to the single input/single output (SISO) measurements corresponding to the diagonal of the transfer function.  We present  a ROM based   Lippmann-Schwinger  approach overcoming this  drawback. It also simplifies  the data-driven computations of the internal field by formulating it as a composition of  Gram-Schmidt transformations on the known background field.  Our algorithm  allows us to obtain the solution of the nonlinear inverse scattering problem at the cost of the linearized Born method however suppressing multi-scattering artifacts such as ghost echoes. Efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated on 2D and 2.5D numerical examples.

Developers fix bugs, add new features and rework code to make it more efficient. A well-run project uses a Pull Request (PR) to review changes before they are allowed into the main branch. Our experience working with PR reviewers is that they have a difficult job. Not only do they have to review code changes that are part of a PR, but also review documentation and test-cases related to those changes, which may reside in other files separate from the PR.     We are developing a Pull-Request Assistant, called MeerCat, that uses repository mining to make a reviewer’s job more manageable by showing the PR author (a) potential problems with the PR they have submitted and (b) modifications they can make to address those problems. A PR author is expected to address these problems before the PR moves into formal review stage. In essence, to aid a PR reviewer, MeerCat puts the onus on the PR author to come to review with a well-thought-out set of changes.     The types of problems MeerCat currently focuses on are in the areas of documentation and testing: we aid a PR author in aligning both documentation and testing with code changes. In many cases, MeerCat can offer specific directions to bring this alignment about, including bringing missing but related files into the PR and suggesting specific modifications.     MeerCat is in beta-testing with several projects at the moment.       </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75726' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1976)' class='star'><span class='star1976'>&star;</span></a> Anshu Dubey  <span id='bitlink-2357'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2357)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2357' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2357)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Mid-Career Scientist Panel: From Doing to Leading</b><br />J&#246;rn Behrens, Donna Calhoun, Anshu Dubey<br />Thursday, March 2 11:30 AM&ndash;1:00 PM<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77137' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1029)' class='star'><span class='star1029'>&star;</span></a> Marcin Dukalski  <span id='bitlink-2358'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2358)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2358' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2358)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Early Applications of Quantum Computing to Subsurface Imaging</b><br />Marcin Dukalski<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-225.html'>Quantum Computing for Engineering Applications - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>We show an application of quantum annealing to solving an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem encountered on land, where strength and timing of scattered waves is used to generate the subsurface image.     
Geological anomalies such as underground rivers, caves, or boulders, have different wave propagation velocity than their surroundings.  This results in abrupt local misalignment in arrival times of detected waves. This can blur the image and misrepresent the geological information. Optimizing the relative alignment of the measurements is described by a multi-modal objective function. Getting stuck in local optima is common, and often a second best optimum, far away in parameter space, gives a false sense of certainty about the subsurface. Solving this conceptually simple, yet mathematically challenging, problem has far reaching implications to the economics of civil engineering, hydrology, gas storage and hydrocarbon exploration.    
We convert the classical optimization to a Discrete Quadratic Model, and through various discrete (classical) variable to qubit encodings to a Binary Quadratic Optimization and its constraints. We discuss how a custom hybrid classical-quantum workflow enables us to solve problems nearing business-relevance and show how the encodings influence the output generated by the 5000-qubit quantum annealer. We discuss some features of this application which could help establishing other use cases in similar disciplines.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75547' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1709)' class='star'><span class='star1709'>&star;</span></a> Andrew Duncan  <span id='bitlink-2359'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2359)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2359' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2359)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Grassmann Stein Variational Gradient Descent</b><br />Andrew Duncan<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-378.html'>Accelerating Bayesian Computations by Leveraging Low-Dimensional Structure</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a deterministic particle inference algorithm that provides an efficient alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo. However, SVGD has been found to suffer from variance underestimation when the dimensionality of the target distribution is high. Recent developments have advocated projecting both the score function and the data onto real lines to sidestep this issue, although this can severely overestimate the model uncertainty. In this talk, we propose Grassmann Stein variational gradient descent (GSVGD) as an alternative approach, which permits projections onto arbitrary dimensional subspaces and which promotes efficient state-space exploration in high-dimensional problems that have an intrinsic low-dimensional structure.

The user-determined dimension of these subspaces can be chosen via  so-called Johnson--Lindenstrauss transforms, and independently of the dimension of the problem. For convergence purposes, both a particular quality of the subspace and the accuracies of random function estimates and models are required to hold with sufficiently high, but fixed, probabilities. Convergence and expected complexity results of STARS are obtained using martingale theory.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75457' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1854)' class='star'><span class='star1854'>&star;</span></a> Weinan E  <span id='bitlink-2363'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2363)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2363' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2363)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>AI for Science and the Implication for Mathematics</b><br />Weinan E<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:00 PM&ndash;1:45 PM<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76299' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1196)' class='star'><span class='star1196'>&star;</span></a> Mohamed S.

Our novel approach utilizes the foundational sphere packing methods in VoroCrust which simultaneously generates a quality triangular mesh of the surface of the input Piecewise Linear Complex (PLC) model and decomposes the enclosed volume by weighted Delaunay simplices with good angles conforming to the surface mesh. VoroCrust has an embedded sizing function that capture the curvature of the model, and robustly represents sharp features and narrow regions that might be associated with the input model. Our new variation VoroCrust-T, similar to VoroCrust, can also handle non-manifold and non-watertight inputs. We illustrate the robustness and output quality of VoroCrust through a collection of models of varying complexity.

We investigate stochastic quantities of interest of the eigenspaces and discuss why, for multiplicity greater than 1, only the stochastic properties of the eigenspaces are meaningful, but not of individual eigenpairs.   To that end, we characterize the Fréchet derivatives of the eigenpairs with respect to the perturbation and provide a new linear characterization for eigenpairs of higher multiplicity.   Based on the Fréchet derivatives of the eigenpair we discuss a meaningful sampling strategy for multiple eigenvalues and develop an uncertainty quantification perturbation approach.   In the latter, the arising tensor equations for the covariance can be efficiently solved by a low-rank method, although alternate approaches such as sparse grids are also feasible.   Finally, we discuss performance gains compared to sampling based methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75580' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(126)' class='star'><span class='star126'>&star;</span></a> Andrea Ebner  <span id='bitlink-2366'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2366)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2366' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2366)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Plug and Play is a Convergent Regularization Method for Inverse Imaging Problems</b><br />Andrea Ebner<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-28.html'>New Methods for Solving Inverse Problems in Imaging</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>A characteristic feature of image reconstruction problems is the non-uniqueness and instability against data perturbations. Therefore, it is necessary to develop regularization methods that aim to find an approximate but stable solutions. A regularization method consists of a family of stable reconstruction methods that converge, as the noise level tends to zero, to an exact solution of the inverse problem. The standard approach is variational regularization, which minimizes a data discrepancy term augmented by a regularizer. The actual numerical implementation applies iterative methods, often involving proximal maps of the regularizer. In recent years, Plug and Play (PnP) iterations have been developed as a new powerful generalization by replacing proximal mappings in variational regularization with general image denoisers. While PnP iterations achieve excellent results, neither stability nor convergence in the sense of regularization have been investigated so far. In this paper, we extend the idea of PnP by considering families of PnP iterations, each accompanied by its own denoiser.  As main theoretical result, we show that such PnP methods leads to a stable and convergent regularization method for decreasing noise level. This demonstrates that the PnP method is mathematically equally justified as the variational model for convergent and stable image reconstruction.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75242' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1589)' class='star'><span class='star1589'>&star;</span></a> Daniel Eckhardt  <span id='bitlink-2367'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2367)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2367' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2367)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fully Discrete Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for Parabolic Problems with Multiple Temporal and Spatial Scales</b><br />Daniel Eckhardt<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-351.html'>Computational Approaches for Multiscale Problems and Their Applications</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>Problems with multiple spatial and temporal scales occur in a variety  of different considered phenomena and materials like saltwater intrusion or storage of radioactive waste products.

Unlike the original active subspace method, it does not require access to the gradient of the model. It relies on an orthogonal projection matrix constructed with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, which is used to linearly project the (high-dimensional) input space to a low-dimensional active subspace. This matrix is incorporated into a neural network as the weight matrix of the first hidden layer, and optimized using back propagation to identify the active subspace of the input. We propose several theoretical extensions, starting with a new analytic relation for the derivatives of Gram-Schmidt vectors, which are required for back propagation. We also strengthen the connection between deep active subspaces and the original active subspace method, and study the use of vector-valued model outputs, which is difficult in the case of the original active subspace method. Additionally, we extract more traditional global sensitivity indices from the neural network to identify important inputs, and compare the resulting reduction of the input space to the dimension of the identified active subspace. Finally, we will assess the performance of the deep active subspace method on (epidemiological) problems with high dimensional input spaces, including an HIV model with 27 inputs and a COVID19 model with a 51-dimensional input space.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75430' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1915)' class='star'><span class='star1915'>&star;</span></a> Helen Edogbanya  <span id='bitlink-2369'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2369)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2369' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2369)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Mathematical Modelling of the Transmission Dynamics of Monkey Pox Using the Differential Transformation Method</b><br />Helen Edogbanya<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1288)' class='star'><span class='star1288'>&star;</span></a> Ayaboe K.

In the case of conservation laws, these schemes often employ non-standard  flux formulations which can entail intrusive coding modifications. Alternatively, Abgrall  introduces a procedure for satisfying additional conservation relations such as entropy  [R. Abgrall, J. Comput. Phys, 2018]; the approach utilizes a telescoping correction term that is agnostic to the baseline  method.  Abgrall's correction term is composed of first and second moment statistics (i.e., the  mean and variance) of the relevant transformation variables (e.g., entropy variables). A  generalization of the methodology is thus made possible by relating averaging to  filtering. Therefore, the current work re-interprets Abgrall's correction procedure as  specialized filter-based artificial dissipation methods [A. K. Edoh, J. Comput. Phys, 2018]. We consider finite difference  discretizations within the SBP-SAT framework and study the impacts of filter choice  (e.g., filter order, stencil localization, wavenumber attenuation) on the overall  performance of the approach.

The method -- unlike many variational inference approaches - avoids explicitly parametrizing posterior approximations. Instead, approximations are formulated implicitly as a sequence of measure transports starting from the prior distribution. In this work, we aim at repurposing SVGD for estimating rare event probabilities in the order of $10^{-3} -- 10^{-10}$. We use importance sampling (IS) and employ SVGD to approximate the optimal importance sampling density. The latter is straight-forward based on a well-known analogy between sampling from Bayesian posteriors and optimal IS distributions: the indicator function of the rare event is treated as the likelihood and estimating the rare event probability amounts to estimating the marginal likelihood or model evidence. In order to avoid non-smooth (indicator) likelihoods, we employ a smooth approximation of the rare event indicator function. We discuss the choice of the smooth indicator approximation and adaptively choosing the smoothing parameter appearing therein, which yields a rare event pendant to annealed SVGD approaches for Bayesian inference. Several examples are used to benchmark the efficacy of our approach against state-of-the-art methods for estimating rare event probabilities.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75800' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1712)' class='star'><span class='star1712'>&star;</span></a> Virginie Ehrlacher  <span id='bitlink-2373'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2373)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2373' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2373)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Influence of Monte-Carlo Sampling on the Convergence Rates of Greedy Algorithms for Reduced-Basis Methods</b><br />Virginie Ehrlacher<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-378.html'>Accelerating Bayesian Computations by Leveraging Low-Dimensional Structure</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>In this talk will be presented recent results about the mathematical study of a variance reduction technique for the computation of parameter-dependent expectations using a reduced basis paradigm.

These theoretical results are not fully practical and we therefore propose a heuristic procedure to choose the number of Monte-Carlo samples at each iteration, inspired from this theoretical study, which provides satisfactory results on several numerical test cases.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75832' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1643)' class='star'><span class='star1643'>&star;</span></a> Martin Eigel  <span id='bitlink-2374'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2374)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2374' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2374)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Convergence of an Empirical Galerkin Method for Parametric PDEs</b><br />Martin Eigel<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-363.html'>Randomized Solvers in Large-Scale Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>Weighted least squares methods have been examined thouroughly to obtain quasi-optimal convergence results for a chosen (polynomial) basis of a linear space. A focus in the analysis lies on the construction of optimal sampling measures and the derivation of a sufficient sample complexity for stable reconstructions. When considering holomorphic functions such as solutions of common parametric PDEs, the anisotropic sparsity they exhibit can be exploited to achieve improved results adapted to the considered problem. In particular, the sparsity of the data transfers to the solution sparsity in terms of polynomial chaos coefficients.    
When using nonlinear model classes, it turns out that the known results cannot be used directly. To obtain comparable a priori rates, we introduce a new weighted version of Stechkin's lemma. This enables to obtain optimal complexity results for a model class of low-rank tensor train  networks. We also show that the solution sparsity results in sparse component tensors. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate a remarkable performance of the derived RALS algorithm in comparison to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75797' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(392)' class='star'><span class='star392'>&star;</span></a> Lukas Einkemmer  <span id='bitlink-2375'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2375)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2375' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2375)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Asymptotic Preserving Dynamical Low-Rank Algorithms for Kinetic Theory</b><br />Lukas Einkemmer<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-87.html'>Numerics of Inverse Problems for Kinetic Models and Their Corresponding Macroscopic PDEs - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Solving kinetic equations, owing to the up to 6-dimensional phase space, is extremely expensive from a computational point of view.

In this talk we will report on recent advances of such asymptotic preserving dynamical low-rank algorithms both from a practical and theoretical point of view. In particular, we consider a way to treat the compresssible fluid limit of the Boltzmann-BGK equation and present a mathematical analysis based on energy estimates for the radiative transfer equation.

We hypothesize that ESC systems are able to capture, describe and replicate many biological optimization phenomena. Unlike many dynamic optimization methods and optimal control solvers used in modeling/studying biological optimization phenomena, ESC systems are real-time, stable and operable through access to measurements (sensing); this matches the nature of biological optimization phenomena.

Typically these are scalar-valued differential forms (SVDFs), however certain quantities such as momentum and stress require the use of (vector) bundle-valued differential forms (BVDFs). In this work we leverage the representation of momentum as a twisted covector-valued volume form to develop geometric mechanics formulations (variational, Hamiltonian, etc.) for momentum-based description of fluids, including a general conservation-type form. We consider a general single-velocity model based a semi-direct product theory (a special case of matched pair dynamics) with arbitrary advected quantities, including those with internal dynamics (ex. electromagnetic fields in electrohydrodynamics). This is sufficient to treat many models of interest, such as the thermal shallow water equations, compressible Euler equations, magnetohydrodynamics and electrohydrodynamics (including Euler-Poisson and Euler-Maxwell). If time permits, there will be discussion about the use of these new BVDF-based geometric mechanics formulations to develop structure-preserving discretizations for momentum-based descriptions of fluids, just as SVDFs are used for velocity-based descriptions.

However, this choice of momentum space coordinates complicates the discretization of the phase-space advection operator due to the appearance of velocity-dependent terms.  In this context, we consider a multidimensional, spectral two-moment model --- closely related to that promoted by Lowrie, Mihalas, and Morel (2001; JQSRT, 69, 291-304) --- which includes special relativistic effects to order v/c, where v is the fluid velocity and c is the speed of light.  This model maintains wave speeds bounded by c and is consistent with conservation of energy and momentum in the laboratory frame.  Here we present a numerical method for evolving this model.  The method uses the discontinuous Galerkin method for phase-space discretization and implicit-explicit time-stepping.  The method is carefully constructed to maintain physical radiation moments during evolution.  We also consider convergence of the implicit neutrino-matter coupling solver and the simultaneous conservation of particle number and energy.  Numerical results that demonstrate the properties of the proposed method will be presented.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75565' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1963)' class='star'><span class='star1963'>&star;</span></a> Allan P.

Classical results from numerical linear algebra and matrix perturbation theory fail to explain why and how such ill-conditioned, noise-corrupted eigenvalue problems should be solvable. This talk presents theoretical analysis and algorithmic recommendations which explain this mystery and provide practical guidance for solution of generalized eigenvalue problems in quantum Krylov methods.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75872' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(48)' class='star'><span class='star48'>&star;</span></a> Yekaterina Epshteyn  <span id='bitlink-2382'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2382)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2382' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2382)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structure-Preserving Numerical Algorithms for Hyperbolic and Related Models with Uncertainty</b><br />Yekaterina Epshteyn<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-11.html'>Computational Methods for Kinetic Models - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we will discuss design of structure-preserving numerical methods for hyperbolic and related models with uncertainty.

Shallow water equations are widely used in many scientific and engineering applications related to modeling of water flows in rivers, lakes and coastal areas.   We will show that the developed structure-preserving numerical methods deliver high-resolution and satisfy necessary stability conditions.

On irregular graph domains this is in general not possible. Kernels that describe diffusion processes or characterize smoothness classes on graphs are not accessible in closed form and have to be calculated numerically. Often, these kernels can be characterized and computed as matrix functions of the graph Laplacian, as for instance the diffusion kernel which is the exponential of the Laplacian. Calculating these matrix functions becomes prohibitive if the size of the graph is large and if the spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian is required.     
In this talk, we will present efficient numerical schemes for the calculation of kernels on large graphs that avoid the spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian. We will focus on two numerical concepts that help to reduce the computational load: the first idea is the usage of Krylov subspace methods tailored to the needs of kernel methods on graphs. These iterative methods approximate relevant parts of the kernels by low-cost matrix polynomials of the graph Laplacian. The second idea exploits local kernel approximation on subdomains of the graph via a partition of unity method that merges the local approximants. We will present some theoretical aspects of these cost-efficient numerical schemes as well as numerical tests demonstrating their benefits.

Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (BO) achieves strong empirical performance on such problems, but even with recent methodological advances, it has been restricted to simple, low-dimensional domains. Most existing BO methods exhibit poor performance on search spaces with more than a few dozen parameters. In this work we propose MORBO, a method for multi-objective Bayesian optimization over high-dimensional search spaces. MORBO performs local Bayesian optimization within multiple trust regions simultaneously, allowing it to explore and identify diverse solutions even when the objective functions are difficult to model globally. We show that MORBO significantly advances the state-of-the-art in sample-efficiency for several high-dimensional synthetic and real-world multi-objective problems, including a vehicle design problem with 222 parameters, demonstrating that MORBO is a practical approach for challenging and important problems that were previously out of reach for BO methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75229' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1248)' class='star'><span class='star1248'>&star;</span></a> Lucas Erlandson  <span id='bitlink-2386'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2386)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2386' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2386)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Handling Corruption in CG and S-Approximate Conjugate Directions</b><br />Lucas Erlandson<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-274.html'>New Algorithmic Developments for Heterogeneous Computing Environments - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Solves are a critical operation used in applications ranging from machine learning to simulations. As computational architectures continue to diversify, particularly with increased parallelization, highly asynchronous solvers are required. Furthermore, a need arises for fault tolerant methods that can natively handle unreliability present in these new environments. However, for linear systems, few asynchronous methods have been the focus of Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance– including a robust Push-Sum algorithm, a robust Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers, and Asynchronous Jacobi. In this presentation, we motivate the need for handling corruption in the Conjugate Gradient Method (CG) and an asynchronous method based on CG known as s-Approximate Conjugate Directions (s-ACD). S-ACD aims to leverage the power of CG through local orthogonality constraints while using Conjugate Directions globally to reduce synchronization points and the s-step framework to further reduce communication. This presentation investigates various corruption schemes, including corruption during communication. We demonstrate how the analogs of the orthogonality constraints evolve during the solves and corruption. Using these metrics, we propose a detection scheme, and motivate correction schemes. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods through numerical experiments.

Connection between time subintervals is established through sequential solution using larger time step, which is used to define and improve the initial solution for each time subinterval. A few interpretations of Parareal have been derived, and one of them links Parareal with a special type of multigrid. The latter paves the way to the development of parallel-in-time multigrid methods, such as MGRIT.    
Borrowing a similar structure to multigrid, it is also possible to construct a parallel-in-time method based on Krylov methods with projection-like preconditioners. Out of several possible implementations, this talk focuses on shift operator, which, like multigrid, allows multilevel solution procedure in a stable way. The coarse time-level system can still be modified so that parallel computation can be performed at the second level, resulting in a parallel-in-time two-level method.    
Numerical results will be presented for linear time-domain wave equations, discretized using a finite-difference method in combination with theta-scheme for time integration.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75512' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1031)' class='star'><span class='star1031'>&star;</span></a> Paul Escapil-Inchausp&#233;  <span id='bitlink-2388'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2388)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2388' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2388)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Uncertainty Quantification for Electromagnetic Scattering Problems via First-Order Sparse Boundary Element Approximation</b><br />Paul Escapil-Inchausp&#233;<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-226.html'>Novel Multilevel Methods for Uncertainty Quantification</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>Electromagnetic scattering problem under small magnitude shape randomness is an important field of research for robust design and high precision industries. Due to the limited and probability measure dependent convergence rate of Monte-Carlo-based simulations, we follow the first-order shape boundary method (FOSB), whose theoretical aspects for electromagnetic scattering were introduced in [Jerez-Hanckes and Schwab, IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis (2017)]. FOSB is a deterministic method based upon shape calculus, boundary integral equations and sparse tensor approximation, allowing for a computation of the statistical moments with a poly-logarithmic complexity for prescribed accuracy. We conduct extensive numerical experiments regarding accuracy and performance. The latter validates our claims and shows broad applicability of the technique. Hence, further improvements are suggested.

Then, we use this approach to analyze the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation associated to the game, especially near the boundary, where the solution happens to be discontinuous. Finally, we show how the new visibility function can be used to design (sub)optimal feedback policies, which approximate the optimal one given by the (HJI) equation, and are computationally much more efficient.

Despite this popularity, convergence results of these methods have been largely limited to the convex/monotone setting. In this work, we study two such methods in the absence of the monotonicity assumption and without requiring smoothness, namely Douglas–Rachford splitting (DRS) and the Chambolle-Pock (CP) algorithm. To this end, we introduce the concept of semimonotonicity and provide sufficient conditions for global convergence of DRS and CP involving the sum of two semimonotone operators. Most notably, it is shown that DRS and CP converge even when the sum of the involved operators (or of their inverses) is nonmonotone. Our analysis relies on establishing a connection between both methods and the preconditioned proximal point algorithm applied to a corresponding underlying operator satisfying an oblique weak Minty assumption.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75305' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1017)' class='star'><span class='star1017'>&star;</span></a> Jasper M.

The resulting posterior distributions assign positive probability to various low-dimensional subspaces and therefore promote sparsity. Samples from this distribution can be generated by solving regularized linear least-squares problems with properly chosen data perturbations.

A characteristic feature of stellarator optimization is the need to optimize for different competing physics objectives that span a range of disparate time and length scales. Further complicating matters, the standard method for computing stellarator equilibria by specifying the plasma boundary is an ill-posed problem. When combined, these properties produce a complex optimization landscape that is both non-convex and not simply connected.   A final barrier to stellarator optimization traditionally has been in the numerical software itself. In general, the existing software for stellarator optimization is very heterogenous in complexity/resource requirements and implementation language, presenting a large barrier to leveraging new developments in both optimization techniques and physics objective models. To address these needs, a new suite of modular optimization packages has been created using Julia that provides a common framework for interfacing equilibrium solvers and physics objectives with robust optimization routines. Built with high-performance computing and usability in mind, new physics objective functions can be seamlessly incorporated into optimizations that performantly scale to thousands of CPUs. This framework has been employed to optimize for turbulent transport simultaneously with good fast particle confinement and quasisymmetry.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75545' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1772)' class='star'><span class='star1772'>&star;</span></a> Jalal Fadili  <span id='bitlink-2399'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2399)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2399' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2399)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Continuum Limit of the Eikonal Equation on Graphs</b><br />Jalal Fadili<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-390.html'>Variational Models for Machine Learning</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>In this work, we study a graph approximation of the time-dependent (local) Eikonal equation with Dirichlet-type boundary conditions, where the kernel in the non-local problem is properly scaled.

In particular, we establish that if the kernel scale parameter decreases at an appropriate rate as n grows, then almost surely, the solution of the problem on graphs converges uniformly to the viscosity solution of the local problem as the time step vanishes and the number vertices n grows large.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75864' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1677)' class='star'><span class='star1677'>&star;</span></a> Thomas Fai  <span id='bitlink-2400'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2400)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2400' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2400)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Lubricated Immersed Boundary Method with Application to Fiber Bundles</b><br />Thomas Fai<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-371.html'>Immersed Boundary and Related Methods: Advances in Methodology and Biological Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Fluid-mediated near contact of elastic structures is a recurring theme in biofluids. The thin fluid layers that arise in applications such as the flow of red blood through blood vessels are difficult to resolve by standard computational fluid dynamics methods based on uniform fluid grids. A key assumption of the lubricated immersed boundary method, which incorporates a subgrid model to resolve thin fluid layers between immersed boundaries, is that the average velocity of nearby boundaries can be accurately computed from under-resolved simulations to bridge between different spatial scales. Here, we present a one-dimensional numerical analysis to assess this assumption and quantify the performance of the average velocity as a multiscale quantity. We explain how this analysis leads to more accurate formulations of the method and present examples from two-dimensional simulations, including applications to filament bundles.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75810' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1566)' class='star'><span class='star1566'>&star;</span></a> Jacob Faibussowitsch  <span id='bitlink-2401'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2401)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2401' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2401)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Portable, Scalable, and Safe Asynchronous Compute on GPUs with PETSc</b><br />Jacob Faibussowitsch<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-345.html'>Recent Developments on GPU-Based Solvers in High-Performance Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>To maximize efficiency on modern GPU hardware the programmer must make use of streams to execute tasks asynchronously from the host system.

One sub-field in particular, deep learning, emerges from the rest. Deep-learning algorithms are more complex and abstract than traditional machine learning algorithms, which allows them to automate some pieces of the training process and eliminate some of the human intervention.  A mesmerizing recent application of deep-learning is the physics-informed neural network, a mesh-free method that can be easily implemented using automatic differentiation from popular deep-learning frameworks. This application is nothing else but a neural network mapping multiple independent variables to a physics field and whose predictions conform to the physics laws described by differential equations. This is achieved by guiding its training with a loss function that includes the equations residuals and the constraint of initial and boundary conditions.  Although previous studies solved a wide variety of differential equations, most applications are still limited to simple one- or two-dimensional domains. However, real-life engineering problems involve more complex geometries. This work demonstrates the application of physical-informed neural networks to such geometries. The demonstration cases solve the steady-state heat conduction equation with both Dirichlet and Neumann conditions in two-dimensional geometries with non-orthogonal boundaries to the Cartesian coordinates.

Here, we take a quantitative approach combining data from recent experiments, mathematical modelling, and Bayesian parameter inference, to describe the self-assembly of multiple epithelial sheets by growth and collision. We use two simple and well-studied continuum models, where cells move either randomly or following population pressure gradients. After suitable calibration, both models can reproduce the main features of single tissue expansions. However, our findings reveal that whenever tissues are not isolated from others, and hence interactions become relevant, the random motion assumption can lead to unrealistic behaviour. Under this setting, a model accounting for population pressure from different cell populations is more appropriate and can help to compare with experimental measures. Finally, we discuss how tissue shape and pressure affect multi-tissue complex collisions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75298' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1276)' class='star'><span class='star1276'>&star;</span></a> Robert D.

In the linear setting, this is equivalent to a forward solve of a block lower-bidiagonal space-time system. Multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) is an approximate block cyclic reduction method for solving these systems in parallel, applicable also to nonlinear problems. One important goal of MGRIT is non-intrusiveness, where ideally users only wrap their existing code for taking a time step. TriMGRIT extends the MGRIT idea to solve time-dependent constrained optimization and optimal control problems, where the systems have block tridiagonal structure and are coupled both forward and backward in time. In this talk, we will describe the TriMGRIT algorithm and present parallel results and experiences for several model problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75636' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(721)' class='star'><span class='star721'>&star;</span></a> Francesco Fambri  <span id='bitlink-2405'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2405)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2405' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2405)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structure Preserving Hybrid Finite Element - Finite Volume for MHD</b><br />Francesco Fambri<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-159.html'>Geometric Mechanics Formulations and Associated Structure-Preserving Discretizations for Fluids - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>In this talk we present a structure preserving  hybrid Finite-Volume approach for solving the compressible MHD equations in all Mach number regimes.  A splitting approach is designed so that we may take advantage of the conservation properties and robustness of the finite-volume (FV) schemes against the nonlinear advection, while relying on a structure-preserving discretization of the magneto-acoustic terms.  Indeed, the nonlinear convective terms are treated via an explicit time-discretization, while the magneto- and acoustic- terms are solved via an implicit time-discretization. Thanks to this, the resulting CFL condition will depend formally only on the fluid velocity and not on the Alfvén- and/or sound-speeds that may become too stringent in the low Mach regimes.  In this approach, the divergence free constraint of the magnetic field is always preserved up to machine precision, and the symmetry of the physical model is also reflected to the symmetry of the final algebraic nonlinear systems. Thanks to the symmetry of the systems, the very-efficient matrix-free conjugate gradient method may be employed.   First, we'll describe and show the main results obtained with a shock-capturing Finite-Volume/staggered Finite-Difference solver, which is shown to be very robust even against stringent MHD shock problems.  Second, our most recent results about the extension of this new family of hybrid schemes to compatible Finite-Elements for weakly compressible flows will be presented.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75454' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(101)' class='star'><span class='star101'>&star;</span></a> Cristiano Fanelli  <span id='bitlink-2406'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2406)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2406' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2406)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Overview of Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for Detector Design at the Electron Ion Collider Detector(s): ePIC and Beyond</b><br />Cristiano Fanelli<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-22.html'>Bayesian Optimization in the Real World -  - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>The Electron Ion Collider (EIC), the future ultimate machine to study the strong force, is a large-scale experiment with an integrated detector that covers the central, far-forward, and far-backward regions.

The approach assumes the integral cost and any PDE constraints are described by polynomials, and is based on a “discretize-then-relax” strategy that leverages tools from polynomial optimization. First, the original variational or PDE control problem is discretized into a sparse polynomial optimization problem using a “bounded” finite-element scheme. This polynomial optimization problem is then relaxed into a hierarchy of convex and highly structured semidefinite programs (SDPs), which in principle can be solved using off-the-shelves software. We prove that solutions of such SDPs will converge to global optimizers of the original variational or PDE control problem at least when the latter are unique. Note that this assumption does not preclude the existence of other stationary points, including local minimizers. The potential of this  computational strategy will be illustrated on a range of examples. Remaining challenges for both analysis and computation will be discussed if time permits.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75224' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(859)' class='star'><span class='star859'>&star;</span></a> Luiz Faria  <span id='bitlink-2408'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2408)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2408' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2408)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High-Order Boundary Integral Equations on Implicitly Defined Surfaces</b><br />Luiz Faria<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-188.html'>Numerical Methods for Particle Suspensions and Fluid-Structure Interactions at Small Scales - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>We present ongoing work on accurately solving boundary integral equations on  implicitly defined surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$.

The proposed methodology, based on a Nystrom  discretization scheme, bypasses the need for generating a body conforming mesh  for the implicit surface, allowing in principle for an efficient coupling  between a robust dynamic level-set representation of deforming surfaces,  and boundary integral equation solvers. Particular attention will be paid to the  computation of singular integrals when only a surface quadrature is available  (i.e. in the absence of an actual mesh).

In this work, we present a scalable augmented Lagrangian preconditioner  for a finite element discretization of the single-fluid incompressible  viscoresistive MHD equations.

Our approach  relies on specialized parameter-robust multigrid methods for the  hydrodynamic and electromagnetic blocks. The scheme ensures exactly  divergence-free approximations of both the velocity and the magnetic  field up to solver tolerances.    
We confirm the robustness of our solver by numerical experiments in  which we consider fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers and coupling  numbers up to 10,000 for stationary problems and up to 100,000 for  transient problems in two and three dimensions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75646' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1304)' class='star'><span class='star1304'>&star;</span></a> Massimiliano Fasi  <span id='bitlink-2410'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2410)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2410' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2410)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multiword Matrix Multiplication with Tensor Cores</b><br />Massimiliano Fasi<br />Tuesday, February 28 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-287.html'>Advances in Large-Scale Solvers in Computational Science and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>In multiword arithmetic, a matrix is represented as the unevaluated sum of two    or more lower-precision matrices, and a matrix product is formed by    multiplying the constituents in low precision.

After confirming the theoretical error bounds experimentally by simulating low    precision in software, we use the cuBLAS and CUTLASS libraries to implement a    number of matrix multiplication algorithms using double-binary16    arithmetic.    When running the algorithms on NVIDIA V100 and A100 GPUs, we find that    double-binary16 is not as accurate as binary32 arithmetic despite    satisfying the same worst-case error bound.

Despite their widespread applications, problems based on factorized models are deemed difficult to solve in their worst case due to their inherent nonconvexity. Our talk is inspired by the recent observations in the optimization and machine learning communities that many realistic and practical instances of factorized models are far from their worst case scenarios.    
We study a natural nonconvex and nonsmooth formulation of two prototypical factorized models, namely low-rank matrix factorization and deep linear regression, where the goal is to recover a low-dimensional model from a limited number of measurements, a subset of which may be grossly corrupted with noise. On the negative side, we show that this problem does not have a benign landscape: with high probability, there always exists a true solution that is not a global minimum of the loss function. However, on the positive side, we show that a simple subgradient method with small initialization is oblivious to such “problematic” solutions; instead, it converges to a balanced solution that is not only close to the ground truth but also enjoys a flat local landscape. Lastly, we empirically verify that the desirable optimization landscape of factorized models extends to other robust learning tasks, including deep matrix recovery and deep ReLU networks with L1-loss.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75787' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(816)' class='star'><span class='star816'>&star;</span></a> Timm Faulwasser  <span id='bitlink-2412'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2412)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2412' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2412)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data-Driven Uncertainty Quantification for Linear Systems</b><br />Timm Faulwasser<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-178.html'>Uncertainty Quantification for Physical Flow Networks</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>Uncertainty propagation and uncertainty quantification is at the core of many control and optimization problems under uncertainty. In this talk, we discuss the prospect of uncertainty propagation for finite-dimensional linear systems in discrete time without explicit knowledge of the actual system model. We combine the framework of polynomial chaos expansions with data-driven system representations stemming from the fundamental lemma. The latter lemma states that under suitable controllability assumptions, any finite horizon input-output trajectory of a linear system is contained in the column space of suitable Hankel matrices constructed from persistently exciting input data and the corresponding output trajectories.    We show that under suitable assumptions on the available input-output measurement data, this enables to propagate Gaussian and non-Gaussian uncertainties through linear systems without explicity model knowledge. We draw upon examples from energy system networks and from other domains to illustrate our findings.

As a compelling alternative solver, we present herein a hybrid multigrid preconditioner that globally coarsens both $p$ and $h$ and can be evaluated in a state-of-the-art matrix-free fashion on parallel distributed systems. We compare its performance and scalability to algebraic multigrid methods, using realistic computations on up to many thousands of MPI processes as test cases.

The key ingredient for practical simulations of marginally resolved flows at moderate to high Reynolds numbers is the energy stability, which can be fulfilled either by L2-conforming discontinuous Galerkin discretizations with techniques to weakly enforce normal continuity and pointwise divergence-free condition, or via H(div)-conforming Raviart-Thomas finite element pairs.

This leads to shortcomings in the resulting governing equations and to a lack of accuracy. In a control setting, this is often treated by a larger control input.  However, modern physics-inspired machine learning does not only allow us to solve complex problems in a data-driven way, but also to gain new insights into the underlying physics. In this work, we use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as well as sparse regression learning to identify the missing physics of a complex system inside a control setting. In detail, we identify nonlinear friction terms inside the model of a 2-dof manipulator based on a limited number of training data, which is either obtained from simulation or experiment. Based on the original and enhanced model, we generate feed-forward control sequences for a trajectory tracking task. A simple PID controller is used to compensate for errors that occur in the feed-forward control. The results show that the controller has to make far fewer corrections to the control variable based on the improved model than was the case with the original model.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75605' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1084)' class='star'><span class='star1084'>&star;</span></a> Mathieu Fehr  <span id='bitlink-2416'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2416)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2416' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2416)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>xDSL: A Compiler Infrastructure for Python DSLs</b><br />Mathieu Fehr<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-238.html'>From Math to Code: Domain-Specific Programming Abstractions, Languages, and Frameworks - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Domain scientists simulate increasingly larger and more complex phenomena, and as a result, must reason about complex low-level parallelism to harness the full power of heterogeneous architecture. Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) abstract away lower-level decisions for multiple back-ends and architectures, allowing domain experts to reason only about high-level concepts. However, DSLs are often developed in isolation and require a lot of effort on the part of the DSL developer, because they cannot reuse pre-existing abstractions defined by other compilation pipelines. We present xDSL, an extensible Python compiler framework that allows compiler developers to reuse abstractions of existing DSLs. xDSL can also leverage the compiler back-end provided by MLIR, which is a new compiler framework from the LLVM community. Additionally, we will present our first integration of xDSL in the Devito and Psyclone compilers, to demonstrate the capabilities of xDSL towards representing different abstractions. The goal of this project is to help different communities share compiler abstractions, in order to build a rich ecosystem of shared intermediate representations and optimizations instead of a large set of isolated monolithic compilers.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75563' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(98)' class='star'><span class='star98'>&star;</span></a> Sarah Feldmann  <span id='bitlink-2417'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2417)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2417' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2417)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Source Detection on Graphs</b><br />Sarah Feldmann<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-21.html'>Optimal Experimental Design and Robust Optimization for Large-Scale Inverse Problems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>The source detection problem consists of a weighted connected graph and a signal spreading through it with the following properties. The signal is sent with a constant velocity from a unique unknown source node. For each node there is the possibility to measure the time at which the signal reaches the node. The goal is to find the source node with as few measurements as possible without knowledge of the starting time or the velocity of the signal. This talk takes two cases into account.    
In the deterministic offline case the combinatorial concept of the spread dimension is introduced. Assuming exact computation and no measurement errors, the objective is to determine as few as possible measurement nodes to uniquely locate the source node, no matter which node actually turns out to be the source.    
In the stochastic online case it is discussed how to find a probable source with an iterative algorithm using parameter estimation and experimental design. This iterative approach requires a repetitive nature of the signal so that in each iteration the information gained in the previous iterations can be used.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75225' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1343)' class='star'><span class='star1343'>&star;</span></a> Timo Felser  <span id='bitlink-2418'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2418)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2418' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2418)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tensor Networks &#8211; From Quantum Mechanics to Artificial Intelligence</b><br />Timo Felser<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-296.html'>Computational Aspects of Tensor Networks - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>Tensor Networks (TNs) are a numerical tool initially designed to simulate quantum many-body systems on a classical computer.

We present an atomistic model to calculate the free energy that combines a quantum tight-binding Hamiltonian of electrons in a honeycomb lattice coupled to a classical nonlinear elasticity theory of von Kármán plates at finite temperature. The strength $g$ of the electron-phonon coupling controls a transition from a stable flat configuration of the sheet to a stable rippled phase. We use a scaling procedure that allows us to effectively reach larger sheet sizes. By numerically solving the model for different size scaling, $k$, we find the critical value of the parameter, $g_c$, and the stable configuration of graphene. For any value of $k$, renormalized elastic constants produce a critical coupling, $g_c(T,k)$, which is a decreasing function of temperature. As the sheet size measured by $k$ tends to infinity, $g_c(T,k)$ decreases to a limiting value, $g_c(T)$, approximately as $k^{0.5}$. In this limit, rippling is a second order phase transition with a susceptibility that scales as $\vert g_c(T,k)-g_c(T)\vert ^{-\gamma}$, with critical exponent $\gamma$ close to 0.25.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75501' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(530)' class='star'><span class='star530'>&star;</span></a> M.

Examples include features in Aeolian dunes and the deposition of volcanic ash, wildfire smoke, and air pollution plumes. Machine learning models are attractive because they can make accurate and fast predictions when the physical processes are not fully understood, experiments are unavailable, or computer simulations are too costly. We explore deep convolutional neural network-based autoencoders exploiting relationships in geophysical spatial patterns to reduce their dimensionality. Reducing the dimension size with an encoder allows us to train regression models linking geographic and meteorological scalar input quantities to the encoded space. Once this is achieved, full predictive spatial patterns are reconstructed using the decoder.  We also designed a novel spatiotemporal prediction model, ST-GasNet, inspired by the partial differential equations used to model plume evolution. The ST-GasNet model learns the spatiotemporal dependencies from limited binary training data and accurately predicts the evolution of spatial distributions of contaminant plumes later in time (15-time steps or 9 minutes) given the initial time sequences (5-time steps or 3 minutes) as the input. Finally, we are currently working on a 3D CNN Autoencoder Architecture to extend our previous work to temporal predictions of the magnitude of the quantities of interest instead of just binary data.

In this talk, we present two methods that make use of  the symbolic form of the potential and the symbolic form of the PDE given by the  user to synthesize efficient FMM code.    
First we describe a method that automatically synthesizes low complexity   translation operators for arbitrary potentials satisfying an elliptic PDE using a compression scheme. These operators have the same complexity as the state of the art spherical/plane wave based translation operators. We observe the asymptotic time complexities for these operators and also give an upper bound on the error in the compression scheme.    
Next we outline a method that automatically synthesizes execution plans for an integral equation representation involving multiple input Green's function and multiple outputs. We introduce tools to reduce the number of FMM calls needed by doing algebraic manipulations on the symbolic integral equation representation.    
Finally, we describe applications where our methods are able to synthesize  efficient execution plans and generate efficient code for each FMM in the  execution plan.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75755' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1225)' class='star'><span class='star1225'>&star;</span></a> Angel Ferran Pousa  <span id='bitlink-2422'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2422)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2422' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2422)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multitask Optimization of Laser-Plasma Accelerators Using Simulation Codes with Different Fidelities</b><br />Angel Ferran Pousa<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-269.html'>Optimization of Particle Beamlines</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Laser-plasma accelerators can generate GeV electron beams in an ultra-compact, cm-scale setup, but have yet to demonstrate sufficient beam quality and stability for demanding applications. To overcome this challenge, broad optimization of the accelerator design with numerical simulations is essential. However, due to the high computational cost of general particle-in-cell simulations, optimization over a large parameter space is prohibitively expensive. Here, we show that cheaper simulations based on reduced physical models can be effectively incorporated into an optimization to strongly reduce the need for fully-detailed simulations. This is enabled by a Bayesian optimization algorithm using a multitask Gaussian process, where two tasks corresponding to the output of each simulation code are defined. The algorithm identifies correlations between both tasks, allowing it to learn from inexpensive evaluations and perform only a few, well-targeted simulations of high fidelity. By means of a proof-of-principle study combining the FBPIC and Wake-T codes, we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in computing time and cost, paving the way towards cost-effective optimization over wide parameter spaces.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75611' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2066)' class='star'><span class='star2066'>&star;</span></a> Matteo Ferrari  <span id='bitlink-2423'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2423)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2423' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2423)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Johnson-N&#233;d&#233;lec coupling for exterior problems: developments on the stability and a virtual elements approach</b><br />Matteo Ferrari<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-428.html'>Computational Engineering (BGCE) Student Paper Prize - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D302<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75494' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1022)' class='star'><span class='star1022'>&star;</span></a> Codie Fiedler Kawaguchi  <span id='bitlink-2424'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2424)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2424' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2424)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quantifying and Reducing Uncertainty in Inertial Confinement Fusion Experiments Using Optimal Experimental Design</b><br />Codie Fiedler Kawaguchi<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-223.html'>Computational Challenges in Fusion Plasma Confinement</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>High Energy Density (HED) science is the study of the behavior of material under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. Understanding the growth and properties of hydrodynamic instabilities and the transition into turbulence is important in many HED processes and also yields insights into other areas where hydrodynamic instabilities occur. In contrast to classical fluids experiments, examining hydrodynamic instabilities in the HED regime poses novel challenges. HED experiments are expensive and often performed at oversubscribed facilities. Additionally, there are many limitations for the available diagnostics and experiments are typically multi-physics in nature. Such complexity means that modeling can become prohibitively expensive. Improving the models from limited experimental and high-fidelity simulation data is therefore of great importance. We will discuss the use of statistical techniques on a large suite of 2D xRAGE simulations of multimode Richtmyer-Meshkov and Rayleigh-Taylor experiments performed on Omega-EP to better understand turbulence in the HED regime. We will preform Bayesian inference to quantify and reduce uncertainty on our model parameters using experimental data. We will also explore experimental design techniques to identify the most informative experiments.

In recent years, operator preconditioning approaches for the EFIE, where the electric field operator is regularised by multiplication with another convenient operator, have become popular. A particular operator that is likely to be considered as a preconditioner is the exact Magnetic-to-Electric (MtE) operator. However, evaluating this operator is as expensive as solving the original EFIE.

Many density functional approximations (DFAs) have been developed in attempt to capture the XC functional, but it is difficult to determine which approximation is best suited to a given problem, and the choice of approximation is a major source of predictive uncertainty. This talk will present an approach to infer probability distributions over predicted quantities by leveraging a data set of DFT predictions computed using an ensemble of different DFAs for a range of molecules. To perform inference, we require some model of the relationship between molecules as well as DFAs. We use a multitask Gaussian Process regression framework to relate regression problems corresponding to different DFAs and define kernel functions to relate descriptors of individual molecules. Tests informed by predictions of the ionization potential of small organic molecules indicate that incorporating multiple DFAs through the multitask framework can improve predictive accuracy compared to a single Gaussian Process regression model informed by one DFA. The challenge of producing robust uncertainty predictions from the distributions predicted by GP regression is ongoing work.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75253' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(703)' class='star'><span class='star703'>&star;</span></a> Nicholas Fisher  <span id='bitlink-2430'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2430)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2430' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2430)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quasi-Interpolation for the Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition</b><br />Nicholas Fisher<br />Wednesday, March 1 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-154.html'>Exterior Calculus in Numerical Computing, Modeling, and Simulation - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>We propose a computationally efficient and stable quasi-interpolation based method for numerically computing the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of a vector field.  To this end, we first explicitly construct a matrix kernel in a general form from polyharmonic splines such that it includes divergence-free/curl-free/harmonic matrix kernels as special cases. Then we apply the matrix kernel to vector decomposition via a convolution technique together with the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition.  More precisely, we show that if we convolve a vector field with a scaled divergence-free (curl-free) matrix kernel, then the resulting divergence-free (curl-free) convolution sequence converges to the corresponding divergence-free (curl-free) part of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of the field as the scale parameter tends to zero. Finally, by discretizing the convolution sequence via certain quadrature rule, we construct a family of (divergence-free/curl-free) quasi-interpolants (defined both in the whole space and over a bounded domain) for approximating divergence-free/curl-free part corresponding to the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of the field, respectively.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75449' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(484)' class='star'><span class='star484'>&star;</span></a> Madalina Fiterau  <span id='bitlink-2431'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2431)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2431' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2431)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Progressive Fusion for Multimodal Integration</b><br />Madalina Fiterau<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-107.html'>Information Fusion for Computational Models and Inverse Problems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Integration of multimodal information from various sources has been shown to boost the performance of machine learning models and thus has received increased attention in recent years. Often such models use deep modality-specific networks to obtain unimodal features which are combined to obtain `late-fusion' representations. However, these designs run the risk of information loss in the respective unimodal pipelines. On the other hand, `early-fusion' methodologies, which combine features early, suffer from the problems associated with feature heterogeneity and high sample complexity.     
We present an iterative representation refinement approach, called Progressive Fusion, which mitigates the issues with late fusion representations. Our model-agnostic technique introduces backward connections that make late stage fused representations available to early layers, improving the expressiveness of the representations at those stages, while retaining the advantages of late fusion designs. We test Progressive Fusion on tasks including affective sentiment detection, multimedia analysis, and time series fusion with different models, demonstrating its versatility. We show that our approach consistently improves performance, for instance attaining a 5% reduction in MSE and 40% improvement in robustness on multimodal time series prediction.

The unknown parameter is represented on an ad hoc basis the dimension of which can be very large. The inverse problem is then formulated w.r.t. the basis coefficients (coordinates), and we show how to select a possibly small subset of them which is most informative w.r.t. the data relative to the heavy-tailed prior. To this end, we propose a novel technique for the diagnosis of the contribution of each basis coefficient that is based on the MAP of the exact posterior density. In the new framework, we perform likelihood-informed dimension reduction by constructing efficiently a low-dimensional approximation to the likelihood function which accounts for the informed coefficients only. In addition, we provide a tractable upper bound on the resulting approximation error measured with the Hellinger distance. We show how MCMC sampling from the approximated but also exact posterior can be accelerated by using pseudo marginal MCMC sampling that is performed only on the selected set of coordinates. In the end of this talk, we present numerical results from examples in computed tomography and image deblurring that affirm the versatility of our method.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75540' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1956)' class='star'><span class='star1956'>&star;</span></a> Molly Folino  <span id='bitlink-2434'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2434)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2434' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2434)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Fourier Series-Based Approach for Estimating Time-Varying Parameters in Differential Equations</b><br />Molly Folino<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1977)' class='star'><span class='star1977'>&star;</span></a> Magnus Fontes  <span id='bitlink-2435'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2435)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2435' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2435)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Forward Looking Panel</b><br />Annalisa Buffa, Magnus Fontes, Thomas Kropf, Satoshi Matsuoka, John Shalf<br />Thursday, March 2 1:00 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77139' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2028)' class='star'><span class='star2028'>&star;</span></a> Magnus Fontes  <span id='bitlink-2436'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2436)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2436' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2436)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>In Control of Life</b><br />Magnus Fontes<br />Wednesday, March 1 8:20 PM&ndash;8:40 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-424.html'>Public Event: The Role of Mathematics in Solving the World's Main Challenges</a> (8:00 PM&ndash;10:00 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>All organisms, including humans, are continuously under attack.

Although Lagrangian-based models have been widely adopted for the study of such bio-aerosols, they remain prohibitively expensive to generate statistically relevant predictions – often requiring an excessive number of particles and numerical experiments. This limitation is further exacerbated as the physics describing the droplet transport become more complex, specifically as it pertains to inertial interactions, evaporation, and the naturally encountered virus decay.  The proposed new model of the polydisperse Gaussian-moment model (PGM) family provides an Eulerian treatment for virus-laden aerosols. The model notably provides a direct treatment for local higher-order statistics such as covariances between particle distinguishable properties (e.g., diameter, temperature, viral load, and non-volatile solute) and particle velocity. Derived within an entropy-maximization moment-closure formulation, the new model yields a set of first-order robustly-hyperbolic balance laws which are efficiently solved with a high-order, massively parallel, discontinuous-Galerkin-Hancock method. This talk provides a summary of the model derivation and its mathematical properties, and illustrates the predictive capabilities for several scenarios of bio-aerosol dispersion.   	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75537' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(983)' class='star'><span class='star983'>&star;</span></a> Daniel Fortunato  <span id='bitlink-2438'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2438)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2438' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2438)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A High-Order Fast Direct Solver for Surface PDEs</b><br />Daniel Fortunato<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-215.html'>Applications & Implementations of Fast Spectral Methods - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>We introduce a fast direct solver for variable-coefficient elliptic partial differential equations on surfaces based on the hierarchical Poincaré–Steklov method. The method takes as input a high-order quadrilateral mesh of a surface and discretizes surface differential operators on each element using a high-order spectral collocation scheme. Elemental solution operators and Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps tangent to the surface are precomputed and merged in a pairwise fashion to yield a hierarchy of solution operators that may be applied in $O(N \log N)$ operations for a mesh with $N$ elements. The resulting fast direct solver may be used to accelerate implicit time-stepping schemes, as the precomputed operators can be reused for fast elliptic solves on surfaces. We apply the method to a range of problems on both smooth surfaces and surfaces with sharp corners and edges, including the static Laplace–Beltrami problem, the Hodge decomposition of a tangential vector field, and some time-dependent reaction–diffusion systems.

Well-established tools for source code management, for software package (and dependency) management and/or application-level virtualisation (containerisation) are often instrumental in the development of software. No matter how “good” these tools alone can hardly ensure long-term sustainability. Teams and communities are equally or even more important than any technical solution chosen. Building community practices to ensure the long-term sustainability of software is rarely given priority in the context of scientific projects which heavily rely on them nonetheless. Co-developing “best practices” with communities proves to lead to a wider/better adoption, more efficient work/developments, higher quality documentation and training material/tutorials, a much flatter learning curve which makes it easier onboarding newcomers, and all that translates into a better take up by researchers. In this talk, the Nordic Infrastructure Community for Earth System Modelling Tools will explain how they have  placed people at the centre of the software development cycle to ensure its long-term sustainability. Successful examples will be presented as well as failures, to highlight what went well or wrong, respectively, and why. It will be discussed in particular the importance to go beyond its own team and community, and to think about a scientific project in a wider context e.g Open Science.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75706' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1231)' class='star'><span class='star1231'>&star;</span></a> Alyson Fox  <span id='bitlink-2441'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2441)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2441' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2441)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Further Investigative Analysis of ZFP Compression</b><br />Alyson Fox<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-270.html'>Recent Advances in Lossy Compression and Data Reduction Methods for Scientific Data - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>Typically, the error from any lossy compression algorithm is deemed acceptable as the data gathered is noisy, either from simulation error, such as truncation, iteration and round-off error, or observational error, such as finite precision measurements and measurement noise. In many statistical analysis applications, additional assumptions on the error are applied that may not be valid in practice. Some emerging tools provide post-analysis of the compressor for the original dataset; however, this is one instance where assumptions about the compressor may mislead users. The focus of this talk is to provide additional theoretical understanding of the components of the ZFP lossy floating-point compressor, ensuring the assumptions we have empirically studied are indeed valid.

We propose a stochastic primal-dual algorithm which is provably convergent and apply it in its multi-agent formulation where each agent in a network performs local calculations and can only communicate with its neighbors. The challenging aspect of our study is that the smooth part of the private cost function is given as an expected value and agents only have access to this part of the problem formulation via a heavy-tailed stochastic oracle. To tackle such sampling-based optimization problems, we propose a stochastic extension of the triangular pre-conditioned primal-dual algorithm [Latafat, Freris, Patrinos, “A new randomized block-coordinate primal-dual proximal algorithm for distributed optimization,” IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 2019].

Motivated by the limitations of classical approaches such as the Reduced Basis method, many authors have now been considering the use of Deep Learning techniques for building nonintrusive ROMs. Here, we propose a novel approach, Deep Orthogonal Decomposition (DOD), where a deep neural network yields a representation of the solution manifold in terms of an adaptive local basis. In principle, designing and training these models can be a challenging task because of the high dimensions involved. As a remedy, we exploit Mesh-Informed Neural Networks (MINNs), a novel class of architectures designed to handle mesh-based data. MINNs embed hidden layers into discrete functional spaces of increasing complexity, obtained through a sequence of meshes defined over the underlying PDE domain. This results in sparse models that are computationally less demanding and thus better suited for the DOD. We assess the proposed approach over a broad set of numerical experiments, including complicated domains and high dimensional parameter spaces, and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods, such as principal orthogonal decomposition and autoencoders. Finally, we present some applications to (inverse) UQ, showcasing the advantages entailed by the DOD approach.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75223' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1279)' class='star'><span class='star1279'>&star;</span></a> Christian Frasser  <span id='bitlink-2444'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2444)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2444' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2444)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stochastic Computing: From Classical to Morphological Neural Networks</b><br />Christian Frasser<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-281.html'>Codesigning a Probabilistic Computing Future: Applications and Algorithms - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>During the last few years, Stochastic Computing (SC) has emerged as a promising design technique for the implementation of energy-efficient Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) hardware. This efficiency is mainly due to the possibility of parallelizing the network through the use of SC and, therefore, minimizing its dependence on a central memory node. In the classical ANN implementation, the SC circuit is adapted to the standard ANN design essentially exploiting the ability to reduce a multiplication within a single logic gate. However, SC has many other advantages such as its ability to implement maximum and minimum functions also with individual gates. Therefore, the possibility of searching for the NN paradigm that best suits the capabilities of SC (and therefore using both products and max-min functions) is opened. In this work we show that NNs known as Morphological Neural Networks (MNN) are ideal to be implemented in hardware using SC. MNNs can be implemented without using activation functions and combine products, sums, maximum and minimum functions. They have been studied in the literature by some researchers in recent years and present the property of universal approximation. An FPGA implementation of a large SC-based MNN is presented and compared with other hardware methodologies in terms of energy efficiency and performance. The results show that the proposed SC-based MNN is as competitive as binary neural networks.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75637' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(100)' class='star'><span class='star100'>&star;</span></a> Peter I.

They are challenging to design, in part because experimental evaluation of a peptide's quality in particular application requires time-consuming and expensive chemical synthesis and characterization, and because a peptide's quality is hard to predict. We discuss the application of Bayesian optimization to this challenge, focusing on three testbed problems: peptides that prevent ice recrystallization, with applications to preserving organs for transplantation; and two ways of using peptides as sensors, one focused on binding metals, and the other on supporting enzymes that attach fluorescent chemical subgroups. All involve real experiments and face common challenges: incorporating domain expertise from chemists, making accurate predictions sequences with appropriately quantified uncertainty, optimizing acquisition functions over discrete sets of molecules, and appropriately leveraging time-consuming computational chemistry simulations.

Common approaches to solving this issue include parametrization schemes which employ stochasticity or which are exclusively dependent on the internal state of the system at a given time. We propose a novel parametrization scheme based on the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and Koopman operator theory. Given a system in which some components of the state are unknown, this method involves defining the surrogate system as being in a time-dependent “quantum-state” which influences the choice of the unknown component of the classical state at each timestep. The quantum state is an operator on the space of classical observables and evolves over time under an action by the Koopman operator. The quantum state also updates with new data-points according to a quantum Bayes’ law, and evolves under the action of data-driven operators. Kernel functions are utilized to allow the quantum Bayes’ law to be implemented numerically. We analyze the results of two different modalities of this methodology applied to the Lorenz 63’ and Lorenz 96‘ systems, and show how this approach preserves important statistical and qualitative properties of the underlying chaotic systems.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75581' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(311)' class='star'><span class='star311'>&star;</span></a> Stefan Frei  <span id='bitlink-2447'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2447)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2447' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2447)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Coarse Propagators for Parallel Time Stepping in Plaque Growth Simulations</b><br />Stefan Frei<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-68.html'>Data-Driven Methods in Computational Biomechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>The numerical simulation of atherosclerotic plaque growth is computationally prohibitive, since it involves a complex cardiovascular fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem with a characteristic time scale of milliseconds to seconds, as well as a plaque growth process governed by reaction-diffusion equations, which takes place over several months.  A resolution of the fast (micro) scale over this period can easily require more than a billion time steps, each corresponding to the solution of a computationally expensive FSI problem.     
To tackle this problem, we combine a temporal homogenisation approach with parallel time-stepping. First, a temporal homogenisation approach separates the problem in an FSI problem on the micro scale and a reaction-diffusion problem on the macro scale.  Second, a parallel time-stepping approach based on the parareal algorithm is applied on the macro-scale of the homogenised system. The parallel scalability is, however, dominated by the computational cost of the coarse propagator. We discuss different possibilities to modify the coarse propagator to further reduce the number of expensive micro problems to be solved and test the numerical algorithms in detailed numerical studies.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75313' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(781)' class='star'><span class='star781'>&star;</span></a> Melina Freitag  <span id='bitlink-2448'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2448)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2448' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2448)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimization-Based Model Order Reduction for Stochastic Systems</b><br />Melina Freitag<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-171.html'>The Interplay of MOR and Optimization in Modern Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we will connect ideas from model order reduction for stochastic linear systems and $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model order reduction for deterministic systems.

When deriving the respective optimality conditions for minimizing the error bounds, we will  see that model order reduction techniques related to iterative rational Krylov algorithms (IRKA) are very natural and effective methods for reducing the dimension of large-scale stochastic systems with  additive and/or multiplicative noise.

The purpose of reduced order modeling is to replace FOMs with reduced order models (ROMs) characterized by much lower complexity but still able to express the physical features of the system under investigation.    
Conventional ROMs anchored to the assumption of modal linear superimposition, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), may reveal inefficient when dealing with nonlinear time-dependent parametrized PDEs, especially for problems featuring coherent structures propagating over time. To overcome these difficulties, we propose an alternative approach based on deep learning (DL) algorithms used to build an efficient nonlinear surrogate. In the resulting DL-ROM, both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics are learned in a non-intrusive way by relying on DL models trained on a set of FOM snapshots, obtained for different parameter values [Fresca et al, JSC, 2021; Fresca et al, CMAME, 2022].     
Accuracy and efficiency of the DL-ROM technique are assessed on parametrized PDE problems in fluid dynamics [Fresca et al, Fluids, 2021] and structural mechanics, by considering, for example, MEMS micromirros [Fresca et al, JNME, 2022], showing that new queries to the DL-ROM can be computed in real-time.

As autonomous cars posses more data about the surrounding traffic, there is a need that traffic models incorporate those.  Therefore, nonlocal traffic flow models can be considered.  They include more information in a certain nonlocal range about the traffic of the road.  In case of non-autonomous drivers, the nonlocal range can stand for the sight of a human driver.  Moreover, this nonlocal range can be interpreted as the connection radius of autonomous cars.    
In this talk we will give an overview on nonlocal traffic flow models and discuss the challenges which arise when comparing these models to real traffic data.

The solution is given explicitly as the sum of a volume potential and a double layer potential. To simplify the evaluation of the volume potential over the complicated domain, we extend the source data to a geometrically simpler domain, which contains the original geometry. It remains only to solve the homogeneous Laplace equation, with modified boundary data, to obtain the full solution. This is done with existing fast and accurate boundary integral methods. The novelty of our solver is the scheme used for creating the extension. The source data is represented on boxes in an adaptive quad-tree. For leaf boxes intersected by the boundary we extend the source data locally to a subset of its colleagues. The extension is created by sampling data from neighboring boxes and using a box-independent precomputed interpolation matrix. The resulting potential induced by the extended source data can then be efficiently computed with existing volume-integral FMMs. We demonstrate speed, robustness and high-order convergence through several examples, including piecewise smooth domains.

The typical way to verify this type of stability, called the Reynolds-Orr energy method, is to show that the energy of a perturbation must decay monotonically under a certain Reynolds number called the Reynolds-Orr energy stability limit. The Reynolds-Orr energy method is known to be overly conservative in many systems, such as in plane Couette flow. Here, we present a methodology to computationally construct Lyapunov functions more general than the energy, which is a quadratic function of the magnitude of the perturbation velocity. These new Lyapunov functions are not restricted to being quadratic, but are instead high-order functionals that depend explicitly on the spectrum of the velocity field in the eigenbasis of the energy stability operator. The methodology involves numerically computing energy eigenmodes and using them to solve a convex optimization problem through a semidefinite program (SDP) constrained by sums-of-squares polynomial ansatzes. We then apply this methodology to 2D plane Couette flow and under certain conditions we find a global stability limit higher than the Reynolds-Orr energy stability limit. For this specific flow, this is the first improvement in over 110 years.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75865' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(227)' class='star'><span class='star227'>&star;</span></a> Jan Niklas Fuhg  <span id='bitlink-2455'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2455)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2455' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2455)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Exploring the Low-Data Regime with Model-Data-Driven Yield Functions</b><br />Jan Niklas Fuhg<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-50.html'>Machine Learning for Computational Solid Mechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>Constitutive modeling of path-dependent processes continues to be a complex challenge in computational solid mechanics.   Recently, data-driven modeling approaches have been proposed that aim to establish stress-evolution laws that avoid user-chosen functional forms by relying on machine learning algorithms.  However, these approaches not only require a significant amount of data but also need data of the full stress space and hence are in particular not suitable for small-data regimes.  In this talk, we discuss a hybrid framework that can work on a variable amount of data by relying on the modularity of the elastoplasticity formulation where each component of the model can be chosen to be either a classical phenomenological or a data-driven model depending on the amount of available information.  The method is tested on synthetic uniaxial data coming from simulations as well as cyclic experimental data of steels.  The obtained material models are found to not only interpolate well but also allow to  extrapolate in a thermodynamically consistent manner far outside the domain of the training data.  Training aspects and details about the implementation of these models into Finite-Element simulations are discussed and analyzed.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75276' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(114)' class='star'><span class='star114'>&star;</span></a> J&#252;rgen Fuhrmann  <span id='bitlink-2456'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2456)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2456' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2456)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>VORONOIFVM.JL - a Multiphysics Finite Volume Solver for Elliptic and Parabolic Systems</b><br />J&#252;rgen Fuhrmann<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-25.html'>Research Software Engineering with Julia - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>The two point flux Voronoi finite volume method on boundary conforming  Delaunay meshes provides framework  for developing discretizations for  nonlinear  elliptic  and  parabolic  systems which  conform  to  first  principles  of physics  like  mass  conservation, maximum  principles,  positivity of concentrations, decay of discrete free energy.

Second, we consider introducing lower precision computing than FP32 into the GMRES(m) method. We implement different variants of the mixed precision GMRES(m) method and examine their behavior. Through the numerical experiments, we investigate the possibility of aggressively using the lower precision computing in the GMRES(m) method and discuss issues for further performance improvement.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75367' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1420)' class='star'><span class='star1420'>&star;</span></a> James Gabbard  <span id='bitlink-2459'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2459)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2459' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2459)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High-Order Method-of-Lines Time Integration for Sharp Immersed Methods with Moving Boundaries</b><br />James Gabbard<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-313.html'>Recent Advances in Cut Cell Discretizations: Accuracy, Stability, and Applications - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Sharp immersed methods are designed to accurately capture moving boundaries without the computational cost and algorithmic challenges of mesh motion or remeshing. However, these methods face a unique challenge in "fresh" or "emerging" computational elements that change sides of an interface during a given time step. Most existing solutions reconstruct an extended flow field in the vicinity of the interface at each time step with up to second-order accuracy. Here we demonstrate that this methodology can be successfully combined with higher-order spatial discretizations and explicit Runge-Kutta time integrators in a method-of-lines approach, and describe the nature of the associated temporal errors. We show an application of this approach to a high-order 3D immersed interface discretization of the advection diffusion equation with moving interfaces, an important intermediate step on the path to a fully high-order sharp interface Navier-Stokes solver.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75701' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1327)' class='star'><span class='star1327'>&star;</span></a> Elena Gaburro  <span id='bitlink-2460'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2460)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2460' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2460)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High Order Quasi-Conservative Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes for Hyperbolic Systems in Primitive Variables</b><br />Elena Gaburro<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-292.html'>Robust Finite Element Methods for Convection-Diffusion Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we present a novel quasi-conservative high order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method able to capture contact discontinuities avoiding any spurious numerical artifacts, thanks to the PDE evolution in primitive variables, while at the same time being strongly conservative on shocks, thanks to a conservative a posteriori subcell Finite Volume (FV) limiter.    
In particular, in this work we consider ADER-DG schemes on Voronoi meshes, and we treat in primitive variables both the predictor step (that produces a local high order accurate space-time reconstruction) and the corrector step which takes care of the final solution update. This is possible because the algorithm is then supplemented with an a posteriori FV limiter, where the solution is checked for physical admissibility, and on the cells judged to be troubled, it is locally recomputed via a robust FV scheme. At this point, we distinguish, by using a criterion based on the divergence of the velocity field, between troubled zone caused by shock discontinuities and all the rest and only on shocks we now apply a FV acting on the conservative version of the PDE.    
To prove the capabilities of our approach, after having verified its correctness on classical benchmarks for the single-fluid Euler equations,  we show its improved reliability on the multi-fluid Euler system on examples, like the interaction of a shock with a helium bubble, for which we are able to avoid the development of any spurious oscillations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75651' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2058)' class='star'><span class='star2058'>&star;</span></a> Lisa Gaedke-Merzhaeuser  <span id='bitlink-2461'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2461)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2461' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2461)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>GPU Acceleration of Spatial-Temporal Bayesian Inference</b><br />Lisa Gaedke-Merzhaeuser<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-109.html'>Parallel Linear Solvers for Ill-Conditioned Engineering Design Problems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Sparse direct solvers are a central component of many computational science analysis codes and often represent most of the full application’s run-time. An instance of this is found in large-scale spatial-temporal approximate Bayesian computing, which has applications in a wide variety of fields like epidemology, drug testing, geophysics and finance. Popular Bayesian methodologies can require iteratively solving a non-convex optimization problem. The matrices involved are sparse, symmetric, positive-definite and often ill-conditioned. They often exhibit a recurring block tridiagonal arrowhead sparsity structure that relates to the spatial-temporal nature of the model. The arising kernel operations are the numerical factorization and selected inversion of such matrices.   This work puts forward a GPU-accelerated block solver tailored to address the computational bottlenecks. It makes use of the particular sparsity pattern of the matrices and leverages dense GPU-operations in an otherwise sparse setting. A scaling analysis for applications of different sizes is presented and comparative benchmarks with PARDISO are shown. We discuss potential other solvers suited to such problems and in particular the GPU version of PARDISO 8.0, for which, in addition to data-integrated simulations results from Bayesian inference, we will also show results from industrial circuit simulations.

This wall shear stress (WSS) has proven to be a biomarker related to the thickness, ulceration and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. In practice, the WSS is not measured directly, but computed from blood flow measurements obtained with phase-contrast 4d flow magnetic resonance imaging. This computation depends explicitly on the flow velocity gradients and the geometry of the vessel. Therefore, the statistics of the WSS measurement noise are different from those of the flow velocity measurement noise. In this work we study the geometric effects that characterize the uncertainty propagation from the flow velocity measurements into the WSS measurements, focusing on velocity measurements obtained with MRI. To achieve this, we propose an additive noise model based on Gaussian processes that allow us to explicitly determine these geometric effects. In particular, we study the spatial correlations in the WSS noise. In addition to this theoretical model, we study a noise model arising from phase-contrast 4d flow magnetic resonance imaging using numerical simulations. We perform additional numerical simulations on synthetic geometries, and on human anatomic models. Our numerical results confirm our theoretical findings and provide evidence of spatial correlations in the WSS noise.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75801' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1024)' class='star'><span class='star1024'>&star;</span></a> Frank Gaitan  <span id='bitlink-2464'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2464)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2464' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2464)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quantum Algorithms for Solving Partial Differential Equations</b><br />Frank Gaitan<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-224.html'>Quantum Computing for Engineering Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>Recently we have developed quantum algorithms for solving the Navier-Stokes equations governing the motion of classical fluids, as well as arbitrary systems of partial differential equations. In this talk we briefly describe the construction of these quantum algorithms and the regimes where they provide a quantum speed-up. We then discuss ongoing work extending these algorithms in multiple directions. First, we describe quantum circuits that implement the quantum oracles appearing in these algorithms so that they are now expressed entirely as quantum circuits. We then discuss how the original spatial discretization based on finite-difference methods can be replaced by: (i) finite-element; (ii) finite-volume; and (iii) spectral methods. Lastly, we discuss the extension of the quantum Navier-Stokes algorithm to problems in magnetohydrodynamics and plasma dynamics. We emphasize that these quantum algorithms open up a large new application area for quantum computing – quantum simulation of classical nonlinear continuum systems and fields – which have substantial economic and scientific impact.

Since the points near the boundary are characterised by an incomplete neighbourhood we observe an unrealistic variation of the stiffness properties in the most external layers of the domain, the surface effect. Two main methods are used to correct it: the definition of modified bonds in the external layers of the domain or the introduction of a fictitious layer of nodes around its boundary.  The imposition of the boundary conditions is often achieved by using a fictitious layer, in the case of displacement bc, or by distributing the external tractions as body forces applied to a certain number of nodes on or close to the boundary. Imposing the boundary conditions as one would do in a local model, generates large fluctuations of the solution. There is no general agreement on the way to “distribute” the boundary loads or displacements over some finite layer.  We will present 1-2-3D examples of the application of a recently proposed version of the “Taylor-based extrapolation method” that makes use of the nearest-node strategy. The method uses a fictitious layer of points around the body where the displacements are determined as functions of the displacements of their closest true nodes by means of multiple Taylor series expansions. The examples will include as well dynamic cases.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75730' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(183)' class='star'><span class='star183'>&star;</span></a> Peter Gangl  <span id='bitlink-2466'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2466)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2466' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2466)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Space-Time Shape Optimization of Rotating Electric Machines</b><br />Peter Gangl<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-40.html'>Advances in Optimal Control and Shape Optimization Concerning Applications in Physics and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>Electric machines can often be modeled by the magneto-quasi-static approximation of Maxwell's equations in two space dimensions.   We consider the simulation of a rotating electric machine by means of a space-time finite element method where the rotation is captured by the tetrahedral space-time mesh. We derive the shape derivative for a given cost function with respect to a perturbation of the (spatial) geometry and present a shape optimization algorithm for moving domains in space-time. Here, it is important to note that the optimized geometry is moving, but must not change its shape over time.  Finally, for a realistic simulation, the initial condition of the evolution problem at hand is obtained as the solution to a static PDE on the given geometry and, thus, is shape-dependent as well. Accounting for this aspect yields a shape optimization problem that is constrained by a system of a static and a transient PDE. We show an extension of our sensitivity analysis and shape optimization algorithm to this setting and present numerical results for the optimization of a synchronous reluctance machine.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75256' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(157)' class='star'><span class='star157'>&star;</span></a> Gregor Gantner  <span id='bitlink-2467'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2467)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2467' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2467)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Applications of a Space-Time First-Order System Least-Squares Formulation of Parabolic PDEs</b><br />Gregor Gantner<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-35.html'>Model Order Reduction in Space and Time: Challenges and Opportunities - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>While the common space-time variational formulation of a parabolic equation results in a bilinear form that is non-coercive,    [F\"uhrer--Karkulik, Space–time least-squares finite elements for parabolic equations, Computers & Mathematics with Applications, 2019] recently proved well-posedness of a space-time first-order system least-squares formulation of the heat equation.  Least-squares formulations always correspond to a symmetric and coercive bilinear form.   In particular, the Galerkin approximation from any conforming trial space exists and is a quasi-best approximation.   Additionally, the least-squares functional automatically provides a reliable and efficient error estimator.     
In [Gantner--Stevenson, Further results on a space-time FOSLS formulation of parabolic PDEs, ESAIM. Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis, 2021], we have generalized the least-squares method of F\"uhrer--Karkulik to general second-order parabolic PDEs with possibly inhomogenoeus Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions.   We employ the space-time least-squares method for parameter-dependent problems as well as optimal control problems [Gantner--Stevenson, Applications of a space-time FOSLS formulation for parabolic PDEs, arXiv, 2022].   In both cases, coercivity of the corresponding bilinear form plays a crucial role.

Car traffic is  described by macroscopic models, while the dynamics of the special  vehicles is described by a microscopic one. More precisely, either  the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model~\cite{LW, R}  or, alternative, the Colombo-Marcellini-Rascle (CMR) model~\cite{CMR}  describes the evolution of traffic in a road.  Assume that a vehicle, whose position  is described by the function $y(t)$, aims at controlling the  behavior of traffic. The evolution of such a vehicle is described by  the ODE $\dot y(t)=u(t)$ where $u(t)$ is a control function,  which selects the desired speed.    
Following the ideas proposed  in~\cite{DMG}, we consider two control models, one based on the LWR  model and one on the CMR model, where  the control acts on the autonomous vehicle.  We discuss about the concepts of  solutions for the two systems and we show that, given a control  function $u=u(t)$ with finite total variation, a solution exists for  both systems. The proofs are based on the wave-front tracking  technique.

However, current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era quantum devices are typically polluted by noise. This work investigates performing optimal control of closed quantum systems for logic gate synthesis under time-dependent uncertainty. We consider an objective function that is the mean of the trace infidelity measure, leading to a risk-neutral optimal control problem. Rather than using a Monte Carlo estimate for the risk-neutral objective, we consider taking a quadratic approximation of the objective with respect to the uncertainty as a proxy. This leads to an explicit expression for the mean of the control objective in terms of the trace of the (preconditioned) Hessian with respect to the uncertainty, for which we leverage trace estimators to approximate with a modest number of Hessian-vector products. Finally, we reformulate the risk-neutral optimization problem as a constrained optimization problem in which we employ a quasi-Newton method to minimize the quadratic approximation with respect to the control. This approach yields a method for which the computation of the risk-neutral objective and its gradient (with respect to the control) has a cost that depends only on the number of trace estimators used which can be chosen independently of the dimension of the control and uncertainty.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75257' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(40)' class='star'><span class='star40'>&star;</span></a> David J.

We explore an encoder-decoder NN structure for both deterministic and   probabilistic models, with Bayesian NNs (BNNs) for the latter. For BNNs, the discretized residual is used to construct the likelihood function. Deterministic and probabilistic convolutional layers are used to learn the applied boundary conditions (BCs) and to detect the problem domain. Dirichlet and Neumann BCs are specified as inputs to NNs, and we explore whether a single NN can solve for similar physics; i.e., the same PDE, but with different BCs and on a number of problem domains. The trained BNN PDE solvers demonstrate a degree of success at extrapolated predictions for BCs that they were not exposed to during training. We demonstrate the capacity and performance of the proposed framework by applying it to different steady-state and equilibrium boundary value problems of diffusion, linear and nonlinear elasticity. Such NN solution frameworks are important for high-throughput solutions of PDEs with different boundary conditions and on varying domains in support of design and decision-making.

M., Pazner, W., Gassner, G.J. Subcell Limiting Strategies for Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Methods. Computers and Fluids (2022).  \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00576}.] and explain how to construct a compatible subcell finite volume scheme that can be seamlessly blended with a high order spectral element discontinuous Galerkin method. We focus on the discretization of (non-linear) conservation laws, such as the KPP equation and the compressible Euler equation.     
Starting with an entropy-dissipative split-form discontinuous Galerkin scheme on collocated Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes, we show how to carefully design a finite volume type discretization on the LGL subcell grid such that it is (i) still provably entropy-dissipative/stable/conservative and (ii) compatible to the high order DG scheme in the sense that we can blend between the low order finite volume and the high order DG discretization on a per element level, or a per node level.     
This new hybrid scheme enables us to do shock capturing and preserve positivity of the solution. We present several strategies including heuristic troubled cell indicators and positivity preserving mechanisms, as well as sophisticated positivity techniques from Flux Corrected Transport schemes including Invariant Domain Preservation a posteriori stabilization and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

To ensure its reliability over a diverse set of platforms, including  CUDA, ROCm, and oneMKL, we built an extensive test suite with continuous  testing to execute a standard set of acceptance tests before merging in code.  Tests and experiments with SLATE require exploring values for a wide  variety of parameters -- matrix dimensions, block sizes, transposition  operations, storage format, CPU or GPU computation, MPI grid dimensions,  algorithm choice, test matrices, etc.  For this purpose, we developed the TestSweeper library to perform  parameter sweeps, which provides significant flexibility and ease of use  compared to LAPACK's robust test suite. For instance, TestSweeper  parameters are specified on the command line, as individual values or  ranges. New parameters are trivial to add with several lines of code.  Output is in tabular form to be both human readable or parsed by scripts,  such as by Python's pandas for analysis and plotting.  SLATE includes an extensive test matrix generation code, with a  flexible string description of the matrix types.    
We also touch on testing SLATE, LAPACK, and BLAS for consistent  propagation of Inf and NaN exceptional values, which the existing  reference BLAS and many vendor BLAS do not handle consistently.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75662' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1243)' class='star'><span class='star1243'>&star;</span></a> St&#233;phane Gaudreault  <span id='bitlink-2475'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2475)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2475' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2475)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Emerging Time Integration Methods for Atmospheric Modeling</b><br />St&#233;phane Gaudreault<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-273.html'>Innovations in Time Integration of Stiff Systems of Differential Equations - Part II of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Exponential time integrators are a very accurate approach for stiff systems of differential equations. In recent years, many advances have been made to improve their computational efficiency. In numerical weather prediction models, it is common to use implicit or semi-implicit integrators with large time steps to reduce the cost of the solution. Exponential methods have the advantage of allowing time steps as large as the implicit schemes, while correctly simulating all relevant wave dispersions. In this presentation, we investigate the potential of different exponential schemes in the context of atmospheric modelling using idealised test cases of the shallow water and Euler equations.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75619' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(181)' class='star'><span class='star181'>&star;</span></a> Nicolas R.

On the other hand, Sobolev smoothing can also be interpreted as an approximation for the shape Hessian. This paper demonstrates, how Sobolev smoothing, interpreted as a shape Hessian approximation, offers considerable benefits, although the parameterization is smooth in itself already. Such an approach is especially beneficial in the context of simultaneous analysis and design, where we deal with inexact flow and adjoint solutions, also called One Shot optimization. Furthermore, the incorporation of the parameterization allows for direct application to engineering test cases, where shapes are always described by a CAD model. The new methodology presented in this paper is used for reference test cases from aerodynamic shape optimization and performance improvements in comparison to a classical Quasi-Newton scheme are shown.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75256' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(723)' class='star'><span class='star723'>&star;</span></a> Fran&#231;ois J.

On the time scale of molecular motion, chemical surface reactions are rare transitions between metastable basins in free-energy landscapes. The interplay of these elementary reactions making up the catalytic cycle can be modeled as a Markov jump process on the lattice of adsorption sites. The corresponding Markovian master equation describing the stochastic reaction kinetics, however, is usually too high-dimensional to be solved with standard numerical techniques and one has to rely on sampling approaches such as the kinetic Monte Carlo method.   	  In this talk, we show how to mitigate the curse of dimensionality for the direct solution of the kinetic master equation by exploiting tensor decompositions. We use the tensor-train format to construct probability distributions as well as transition-rate matrices in form of networks of so-called tensor cores representing the different adsorption sites. The performance of the approach is demonstrated on a reduced model for the CO oxidation on the RuO$_2$(110) surface. We investigate the complexity for increasing system size as well as for various reaction conditions and illustrate the advantage over stochastic simulation approaches by a sequence of problems with increasing stiffness.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75497' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(552)' class='star'><span class='star552'>&star;</span></a> Jithin D.

Complex time stepping also allows us to break the Runge-Kutta order barrier, enabling 5th order accuracy using only five function evaluations.

With the growing sizes of problems and increasing relative costs of data movements on modern architectures, it has become crucial to further optimize the memory and communication costs of parallel BLR solvers.   In order to do so, we introduce several new approaches targeting both the LU factorization and solution phases of the solver. The key ideas include using mixed precision representations, designing data access patterns better suited to BLR, and compressing intermediate data, even at the cost of increasing the number of operations.

Vector operations like the gradient, curl and divergence in this representation take the particularly simple form of incidence matrices, which are very sparse matrices containing only $1$ and $-1$ as non-zero entries.    
The dual vector operations, in general, will not be sparse, topological matrices unless a de Rham sequence is constructed for the dual space. In this talk these dual spaces will be presented, yielding also highly sparse matrix representations for the dual vector operations. The mass matrices of the primal spaces serve as Riesz maps to switch between the primal and dual spaces. This construction immediately gives a representation for the trace spaces. These ideas are presented in [Jain, Zhang, Palha & Gerritsma, Construction and Application of Algebraic Dual Polynomial Representations for Finite Element Methods on Quadrilateral and Hexahedral Meshes, Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 95, 101-142, 2021].

Efficient evaluation of  the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map, which involves solution of the  forward model, is key to making BOED problems tractable. Surrogate  approximations of PtO maps can greatly accelerate  solution of BOED problems, provided an accurate surrogate can be  trained with modest numbers of model solves.  Unfortunately,  constructing such surrogates presents significant challenges when the  parameter dimension is high and the forward model is expensive.    
Deep neural network surrogates of PtO maps, also known as neural  operators, have emerged as leading contenders for overcoming these  challenges. Black box application of DNNs for  problems with infinite dimensional parameter fields leads to poor  results when training data are limited. However, by constructing a network architecture that exploits  the geometry of the PtO map---in particular its smoothness,  anisotropy, and intrinsic low-dimensionality as revealed through  adjoint-PDE-based Gauss-Newton Hessians, one can construct a  dimension-independent geometric neural operator with superior  generalization properties using only limited training data. We employ  this neural operator to make tractable the BOED problem of finding  sensor locations that maximize the expected information gain from the  data, and demonstrate on an inverse wave scattering problem.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75461' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(45)' class='star'><span class='star45'>&star;</span></a> Debojyoti Ghosh  <span id='bitlink-2488'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2488)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2488' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2488)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Semi-Implicit Time Integration for Multiscale Tokamak-Edge Plasma Dynamics</b><br />Debojyoti Ghosh<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-10.html'>Computational Methods for Kinetic Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Tokamak edge plasmas are characterized by a large range of time scales, and the scales of interest are often much slower than the fastest scales. We present an implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration framework in COGENT, a high-order code for tokamak edge simulations. The governing equations comprise collisional gyrokinetic equations for ion species and may include fluid equations for charged and neutral species as well as kinetic, fluid, or Boltzmann models for electrons. The large number of physics models implemented requires a flexible framework, where the implicit terms depend on the specific simulation. We implement additive Runge-Kutta (ARK) methods, where the implicit system is solved using the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method. We also consider a modified form of the ARK methods for ODEs with a nonlinear left-hand-side operator, d[M(u)]/dt = L(u), that arise from a vorticity model of the electrostatic potential. The implicit term comprises multiple physics models; thus, we adopt a multiphysics preconditioning strategy that wraps individual preconditioners for each model with an operator-split approach to precondition the overall system. This allows tailored preconditioning strategies for each implicit physics. We demonstrate our algorithm on test cases representative of tokamak-edge plasma dynamics.

Various low rank compression kernels are compared, including methods based on adaptive randomized sampling, in terms of accuracy and performance on the GPU. The multifrontal solver can furthermore combine multiple rank structured formats, such as block low rank and hierarchically off-diagonal butterfly, where the choice of approximation method depends on the size of the frontal matrix being compressed. This combination reduces both the asymptotic complexity as well as the runtime for medium scale problem sizes.

As these algorithms might still require significant resources, providing parallel algorithms can further raise the scale of problems solvable within a given time limit.   For example, subgraph isomorphism becomes tractable on planar graphs and other apex-minor-free families of graphs. Moreover, searching for maximum cliques becomes tractable in planar and other bounded-degeneracy graphs.   This talk discusses our recent advances in parallel algorithms for these problems. Our algorithms must avoid large sequential graph traversals and instead quickly break apart the graphs into independent parts.   We provide algorithms whose work grows only linearly with the size of the target graph and whose depth grows poly-logarithmically with the size of the target graph.   These results imply more work-efficient algorithms for other problems, such as vertex connectivity in planar graphs.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75881' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1544)' class='star'><span class='star1544'>&star;</span></a> Aviv Gibali  <span id='bitlink-2492'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2492)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2492' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2492)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimization in Radiotherapy</b><br />Aviv Gibali<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-340.html'>ECMI: Perspectives and Successes of Mathematical Challenges in Industrial Applications  - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>In this talk I will provide an overview of models and algorithms in the field of radiotherapy from optimization and feasibility aspects.

Existing methods for computing this approximation when data is held privately on multiple machines require a central parameter server or the transmission of local gradients; otherwise, they scale poorly with the amount of data. To develop a communication-efficient and scale-invariant  decentralized algorithm, we frame the computation as a decentralized consensus optimization problem and introduce reasonable approximations to simplify the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solution. Limited numerical experiments show that our algorithm can outperform its centralized version and is competitive with decentralized stochastic gradient descent. While theoretical guarantees of convergence are absent, this work furthers the development of reliable decentralized solutions to problems posed in non-traditional computing environments.

To automate this effort and improve efficiency of adaptive methods, we recast adaptive mesh refinement as a partially-observed Markov decision process that can be optimized using methods from reinforcement learning. This recasting delivers a tractable optimization framework that can be tuned once by automated training and then deployed successfully in contexts outside the training regime. We use the Poisson equation to demonstrate various applications of our framework including representative h- and hp-refinement AFEM simulations on non-convex polyhedra. Our experiments indicate that superior marking policies remain undiscovered for many canonical AFEM applications.  An unexpected observation is that marking policies trained on one family of PDEs can be robust enough to perform well on problems far outside the training family. For instance, we show that a simple hp-refinement policy optimized on 2D problems can be used for 3D problems without significant performance loss.  Extensions of these ideas to transient PDEs and multi-objective optimization frameworks will also be discussed.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75420' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1385)' class='star'><span class='star1385'>&star;</span></a> Adrianna Gillman  <span id='bitlink-2497'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2497)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2497' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2497)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Spectral Method for Triangulated Meshes</b><br />Adrianna Gillman<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-306.html'>Fast Algorithms for Variable Coefficient, Time-Dependent, and Inhomogeneous Problems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75685' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1866)' class='star'><span class='star1866'>&star;</span></a> William Gilpin  <span id='bitlink-2498'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2498)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2498' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2498)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Discovering Shared Causal Drivers from Highly-Corrupted Time Series</b><br />William Gilpin<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1658)' class='star'><span class='star1658'>&star;</span></a> Zydrunas Gimbutas  <span id='bitlink-2499'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2499)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2499' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2499)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quadratures for Edge and Corner Discretization Schemes in Three Dimensions</b><br />Zydrunas Gimbutas<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-367.html'>Boundary Integral Equations, Boundary Element Methods, and Applications - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we present an RCIP-type scheme for  discretizing corner and edge singularities in three dimensions.

During an offline phase, time consuming approximations $u_h(\cdot;\mu_i)$ of $u(\cdot;\mu_i)$ are computed using a finite element mesh with size $h$, for given $\mu_i$, $i=1, \ldots, N$. Then, the parameter-to-solution map $\mu \mapsto u_h(\cdot;\mu)$ is approximated using a deep neural network, producing an approximation $u_{h,\mathcal{N}}(\cdot;\mu)$ of $u_h(\cdot;\mu)$. The evaluation of the neural network, performed in an online phase, is instantaneous, or at least much faster than a single numerical simulation.  We next decompose the $L^2$ error in $\Omega \times \mathcal{P}$ into  \begin{align*}      \vert \vert u-u_{h,\mathcal{N}}\vert \vert _{L^2(\Omega \times \mathcal{P})}\leq \vert \vert u-u_{h}\vert \vert _{L^2(\Omega \times \mathcal{P})}+\vert \vert u_h-u_{h,\mathcal{N}}\vert \vert _{L^2(\Omega \times \mathcal{P})}.  \end{align*}  Both error terms can be estimated using Monte-Carlo type estimates over the parameters space and an a posteriori error estimator in the physical space for the first term. In the presentation, we discuss in more detail the estimation of these two terms and show numerical experiments both for a model problem and a more complex one.

State redistribution relaxes the overly restrictive CFL condition that results from arbitrarily small cut cells when explicit time steppers are used.  We show how to stabilize both finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations and take time steps that are proportional to the size of Cartesian cells in the background grid.  State redistribution works by post-processing the numerical solution after each stage or step of an explicit time stepping method. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require complex geometric manipulations. We solve a number of test problems with smooth and shocked solutions that demonstrate the encouraging potential of this technique for applications on embedded boundary grids.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75207' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1797)' class='star'><span class='star1797'>&star;</span></a> Peyman Givi  <span id='bitlink-2505'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2505)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2505' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2505)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Matrix Product State Simulation of the Burgers'-Fisher's Equation</b><br />Peyman Givi<br />Thursday, March 2 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-395.html'>Quantum Algorithms for Scientific Computing - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>The quantum-inspired, matrix product state (MPS) methodology is invoked to simulate the Burgers'-Fisher-KPP one-dimensional advection-diffusion-reaction equation.

Stratocumulus clouds have a great effect on Earth’s energy budget because (i) they can reflect sunlight; and (ii) they cover vast amounts of our planet. It is thus important to understand and model stratocumulus clouds and in this talk, we make connections between two very different models. The first model is a large eddy simulation (LES), which is a cloud resolving 3D atmospheric simulation that is computationally expensive to run. The second model is a scalar delay differential equation (DDE), which is trivial to run and that interprets the interactions of precipitation and cloud as a predator (rain) and prey (cloud). We connect these two models by estimating parameters of the predator prey model from LES that reflect a variety of meteorological conditions. We rely on a feature-based approach to parameter estimation and numerically solve the problem using an affine invariant ensemble sampler. The result of our computations is a map of meteorological conditions to the parameter space of the predator prey model, which is needed if one were to use it to parameterize stratocumulus clouds in Earth system and climate models.

However, for problems with slowly decaying Kolmogorov-n-widths such as certain transport-dominated problems, classical linear-subspace reduced order models (ROMs) of low dimension might yield inaccurate results. Thus, the reduced space needs to be extended to more general nonlinear manifolds. Moreover, as we are dealing with Hamiltonian systems, it is crucial that the underlying symplectic structure is preserved in the reduced model.     
To the best of our knowledge, existing literatures addresses either model reduction on manifolds or symplectic model reduction for Hamiltonian systems, but not their combination. In this talk, we bridge these two approaches by providing a novel projection technique called symplectic manifold Galerkin, which projects the Hamiltonian system onto a nonlinear symplectic trial manifold such that the ROM is again a Hamiltonian system. We provide numerical results which demonstrate the ability of the method to outperform linear-subspace ROMs.  high-level commands.

The increasing performance demand in terms of lower power consumption and enhanced sensitivity requires performing nonlinear dynamic simulations that require adequate tools. MEMS designers can resort to standard full order simulation techniques such as the Finite Element (FE) Method, nevertheless, the high computational burden is limiting their practical usage. Reduced Order Models (ROMs) provide an appealing alternative to building reliable and efficient nonlinear dynamical models. In particular Data-Driven methods allow building a ROM starting from data and without acting intrusively in the reduction procedure itself. Most of these approaches aim at modelling the dynamic behaviour of general systems, i.e. transient and steady-state regimes. Despite the generality of these approaches, some properties typical of the steady-state regime e.g., periodicity are difficult to reproduce. In this contribution, we propose a technique that, through deep learning autoencoders and harmonic decomposition, allows building efficient and accurate ROMs for the steady state regime for resonating MEMS.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75596' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(345)' class='star'><span class='star345'>&star;</span></a> Andy J.

Typically, QOC objectives are stated in terms of a terminal cost. Alternatively, the QOC objective can include both a running and terminal cost for the purpose of tracking a design trajectory. If existing QOC software is treated as a black box, then a robust, fast, and optimal-bandwidth control pulse can be obtained and used to induce a corresponding best-case design trajectory. This QOC solution can still suffer from model mismatch with the experimental system. In this work, we apply iterative learning control (ILC) to eliminate the tracking error from model mismatch by leveraging a limited number of state tomography experiments along the process trajectory.  Many industrial control applications successfully operate by tracking specific trajectories of repetitive tasks across iterations. As the process repeats, any errors along the iteration axis would also repeat; by combining the model and feedback, ILC offers a framework for suppressing these errors. To demonstrate our approach, we apply ILC to realize the necessary pulses to track the design trajectory of representative one and two-qubit gates under quasi-static control errors.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75325' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1440)' class='star'><span class='star1440'>&star;</span></a> Andrew Golightly  <span id='bitlink-2513'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2513)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2513' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2513)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Augmented Pseudo-Marginal Metropolis-Hastings for Partially Observed Diffusion Processes</b><br />Andrew Golightly<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-317.html'>Computational Methods for Inverse Problems with Nuisance Parameters</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>We consider the problem of parameter inference for partially observed Markov process models using data at discrete times that may be incomplete and subject to measurement error. We integrate over uncertainty in the latent process between observation times via a state-of-the-art correlated pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, that aims to improve mixing of the parameter chains by inducing positive correlation between successive estimates of the intractable observed data likelihood. However, unless the measurement error or the dimension of the latent process is small, correlation can be eroded by the resampling steps in the particle filter. We therefore propose a novel augmentation scheme, that allows for conditioning on values of the latent process at the observation times, completely avoiding the need for resampling steps. We integrate over the uncertainty at the observation times with an additional Gibbs step. We illustrate the resulting methodology in the context of nonlinear multivariate diffusion processes and find that our approach offers substantial increases in overall efficiency, compared to some competing methods.

The well-balanced reconstruction procedure introduced by two of the authors in some previous work is applied, based on the development of well-balanced reconstruction operators. The well-balanced property is preserved when quadrature formulas are used to approximate the averages and integral of the source term in the cells. This technique is combined with a time discretization method for the time evolution of type RK-IMEX or RK-implicit. The methodology will be applied to several systems of balance laws, such as the Burgers equation or the shallow water equations with Manning friction.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75510' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(802)' class='star'><span class='star802'>&star;</span></a> Gonzalo Gonzalez de Diego  <span id='bitlink-2517'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2517)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2517' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2517)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Numerical Method for Subglacial Cavity Formation</b><br />Gonzalo Gonzalez de Diego<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-175.html'>Reliable and Efficient Methods for Coupled Problems in Porous Media - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Water-filled cavities form in the interface between the ice and the bedrock as an ice sheet or glacier slides along an obstacle. Over sufficiently long timescales, ice is assumed to flow as a viscous flow with a nonlinear rheology. Subglacial cavity formation is an important mechanism in several glaciological applications: 1) the determination of a relationship between sliding speed and basal shear stress (the sliding law), 2) the evolution of subglacial hydrology systems, which act as porous media under an ice sheet through which meltwater flows, 3) the filling and drainage of subglacial lakes, which are essentially large cavities under ice sheets coupled to the subglacial hydrology system. In this talk, we present a numerical model for subglacial cavitation which couples the Stokes equations to a free boundary equation. The opening and closing of a cavity is a time-dependent problem in which the ice detaches and reattaches from the bedrock. Detachment is achieved in the model by solving the Stokes equations with contact boundary conditions; as a result, a Stokes variational inequality must be solved at each time step.

They exhibit finite-size scaling and have dynamic critical exponent $z\approx 1$. Midge swarms have reproductive purposes, form near a marker placed on the floor, and comprise less than 900 flying male insects. An important model of flocking is Vicesk’s: $N$ particles under discrete time dynamics align their velocities to the average velocity of all particles within their sphere of influence plus an alignment noise. To avoid aligned particles escaping to infinity, particles are usually confined within a box with periodic boundary conditions. Instead, we subject the particles to a confining harmonic potential in infinite space. For this model, appropriate noise and confinement strength, we have discovered a novel phase transition. The confinement versus noise critical line separates disperse single-cluster from multicluster chaos (distinguished by topological data analysis), swarms are scale-free, have minimal correlation time, correlation length proportional to swarm size. The largest Lyapunov exponent vanishes with confinement. Susceptibility, correlation length, dynamic correlation function, largest Lyapunov exponent obey power laws. Their critical exponents agree fairly with observations of natural midge swarms. These results contrast with those obtained from the order-disorder transition of the Vicsek model confined in a finite box under periodic boundary conditions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75379' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1955)' class='star'><span class='star1955'>&star;</span></a> Tristan Goodwill  <span id='bitlink-2519'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2519)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2519' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2519)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Integral Equation Method for a Broad Class of Elliptic PDEs on Surfaces</b><br />Tristan Goodwill<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1384)' class='star'><span class='star1384'>&star;</span></a> Abinand Gopal  <span id='bitlink-2520'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2520)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2520' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2520)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Accelerated, High-Order Direct Solver for the Lippmann-Schwinger Equation</b><br />Abinand Gopal<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-306.html'>Fast Algorithms for Variable Coefficient, Time-Dependent, and Inhomogeneous Problems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Scattering problems in variable media are often best-handled by first  reformulating the problem as an integral equation, known as the  Lippmann-Schwinger equation.

However, the resulting coefficient matrices  are dense which poses a challenge in the development of efficient solvers,  especially in applications with backscattering where iterative solvers can  take prohibitively large numbers of iterations.

It has many industrial applications in domains such as automotive, aerospace, to name a few. Lot of experimental and computational resources are used to characterize and study turbulent flow. With the advent of deep learning, a new method known as Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) has been recently introduced which shows tremendous promise in not only reducing computational costs but could potentially save costs on experiments or measurements, which is a huge advantage. In this work, we will show solutions based on PINN methods to simulate two-dimensional turbulence. PINN is a powerful technique where the governing equation of the system is enforced in the neural network architecture. Along with traditional PINN, we also take a sparse set of training data inside the computational domain. We show two different PINN based neural network architectures and compare them with direct numerical simulation (DNS) results. For Reynolds number of order $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, with the new PINN model which we call as PINN-FF (Fourier filter), we observe a close match in kinetic energy spectra even while using only $0.1 %$ training data. We observe very good match of the large scale structures in comparison with DNS although the small scale structures are yet to be refined. Also, we observe similar results at higher Reynolds numbers of order $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ which ensures robustness of the approach.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75208' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1908)' class='star'><span class='star1908'>&star;</span></a> Luca Gorini  <span id='bitlink-2523'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2523)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2523' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2523)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Geometric Shape Optimization for Reflexive Optics</b><br />Luca Gorini<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(542)' class='star'><span class='star542'>&star;</span></a> Grant Gorman  <span id='bitlink-2524'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2524)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2524' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2524)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Two-Fluid Simulations of Ultracold Neutral Plasmas in the Absence of External Magnetic Fields</b><br />Grant Gorman<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-118.html'>Kinetic and Continuum Theories for Computational Plasma Physics - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Ultracold neutral plasmas (UCNPs), created by the photoionization of a cold gas, are an excellent platform for studying neutral plasmas in far more complex environments such as plasma in the Sun’s atmosphere, white dwarf stars, and inertial-confinement fusion devices. UCNPs are highly versatile systems with ion temperatures below 1 K, tunable electron temperatures from 1-1000 K, and densities ranging from $10^6$-$10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ and have proven to be an ideal testbed for a wide variety of numerical plasma models due to their clean and controllable initial conditions and precise diagnostics. In this talk, I will discuss our recent progress developing a multi-physics, two-fluid (2F) plasma code for the purpose of simulating plasmas spanning the ultracold in a laboratory environment to the aftermath of interchange reconnection in the solar corona. The code is validated in the absence of external magnetic fields by comparing 2F simulations of the evolution of a UCNPs with various initial conditions to experimental data and kinetic theory, including the evolution of a UCNP with a spherically symmetric Gaussian density distribution, the propagation of planar ion holes, and the evolution of ion acoustic waves excited by a periodic density perturbation.

MFNets provide a flexible approach to modeling the relationships between unstructured ensembles of models and information sources by linking the outputs of each information source though a network of models. These structures can then be leveraged for forward and inverse problems. One of the challenges in this approach is determining good graphs to represent the information sources. In this talk we discuss and overview several graph-building strategies and apply them to MFNets. Specifically, we compare graph incremental construction, model selection, and model averaging. We take a probabilistic viewpoint for assessing and developing graph construction algorithms and investigate how the inner inference loops affect the resulting outcome. For example, we determine how posteriors based on variational inference affect the resulting graphs. Examples from both synthetic and physical models are provided.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75382' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(568)' class='star'><span class='star568'>&star;</span></a> Ion Victor Gosea  <span id='bitlink-2526'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2526)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2526' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2526)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Lifting Transformations and One-Sided Model Reduction for Classes of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</b><br />Ion Victor Gosea<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-125.html'>Exact Polynomialization and Quadratization of Nonlinear Dynamics - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>The problem of approximating and equivalently formulating generic nonlinear systems with analytic nonlinearities is studied. We are concerned with the study of lifting nonlinear systems to a polynomial (i.e., quadratic-bilinear, in short QB) structure, and with applying model order reduction (MOR) techniques for lowering the complexity (number of states) of such reformulated systems. Lifting techniques have been successfully applied in recent years for MOR purposes, starting with the works of Gu, Benner, Breiten, Goyal (and collaborators), and more recently, with those of Willcox, Peherstorfer, Kramer, Qian (and collaborators). Systems with bilinear and quadratic dynamics can be used as surrogates for systems with more general nonlinearities. By means of lifting transformations, one is able to reformulate the original nonlinear dynamics into such a format. Then, the problem of MOR for large-scale lifted QB models arises. In particular, we propose a data-driven approach that requires samples of multivariate input-output mappings (in the frequency domain). The latter are (symmetric) generalized transfer functions (symGTFs), which are appropriately defined for QB systems. The MOR approach is data-driven, moment-matching-based, and it requires evaluations of the symGTFs. We show how to (explicitly) fit only a few sample values thereof, and also how to use the available degrees of freedom to derive QB ROMs, in a non-intrusive way. Finally, we present two numerical applications.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75412' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1137)' class='star'><span class='star1137'>&star;</span></a> Shubham K.

The method relaxes data synchronization between processing elements (PEs) at a mathematical level, allowing computations to proceed regardless of communications status. Recently, we developed an asynchronous discontinuous-Galerkin (ADG) method, which can provide accurate solutions in the absence of data communication and/or synchronization. As the arrival time of messages between PEs is random, the latest available time level at the buffer nodes near PE boundaries is also random. This makes the update equations at the boundary elements of the PDE solver stochastic, posing a challenge in analyzing the stability properties of the underlying schemes using standard methods. In this work, we develop a novel Fourier stability analysis coupled with the eigen-decomposition of the amplification matrix to analyze the properties of schemes based on the ADG method. We investigate errors incurred in terms of dispersive and dissipative nature. Unlike the standard DG method, where the stability properties depend on the schemes as well as the simulation parameters like grid spacing and time step, we show that the properties of the ADG method can also depend on the number of PEs used and the amount of delay in communication. Our analysis results show that the ADG schemes are stable but with stricter CFL conditions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75575' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1071)' class='star'><span class='star1071'>&star;</span></a> Somdatta Goswami  <span id='bitlink-2528'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2528)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2528' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2528)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Operator Learning for Probabilistic Mechanics</b><br />Somdatta Goswami<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-235.html'>Machine Learning and Data-Driven Methods in Probabilistic Mechanics - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75558' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1889)' class='star'><span class='star1889'>&star;</span></a> Sebastian G&#246;tschel  <span id='bitlink-2529'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2529)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2529' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2529)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Accelerating Parallel-in-Time Methods</b><br />Sebastian G&#246;tschel<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(466)' class='star'><span class='star466'>&star;</span></a> Kevin N.

One new technology that may be able to improve performance of HPC communication kernels is stream triggered communication.

We’ll then present the results of adding stream-triggered communications to AMReX’s FillBoundary halo exchange operation, using the optimal algorithm. Finally, higher level application improvements that are enabled by stream-triggered communications will be discussed, such as redesigning stream interactions between the CPU and GPU to eliminate synchronizations and maximize GPU uptime.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75374' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(217)' class='star'><span class='star217'>&star;</span></a> Sigal Gottlieb  <span id='bitlink-2531'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2531)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2531' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2531)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Mixed Model/Precision Methods</b><br />Sigal Gottlieb<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-46.html'>Taming the Curse of Dimensionality in Non-Equilibrium Transport Systems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>Additive Runge-Kutta methods designed for preserving highly accurate solutions in   mixed-precision and mixed-model computation  were proposed and analyzed in   a recent paper by Z.

In the present work, we present nonlinear analysis tools that draw from Chemical Thermodynamics. Through Gibbs formalism, chemical thermodynamics provides a well-known theoretical expression for a reaction's chemical equilibrium constant in terms of reduced chemical potentials. A less-known yet extremely valuable result is that if this expression is implemented, mass action kinetic models are consistent with the dynamical prescriptions of the 2nd law. For fixed-temperature chemical ODEs, this incurs a decreasing Helmholtz free energy. If the temperature is allowed to vary in accordance with conservation of energy (1st law), this incurs the popular statement of increasing entropy. These nonlinear prescriptions can and should be used to further develop temporal integration techniques for reaction kinetics. We demonstrate that these prescriptions hold even the equilibrium constants are approximated from data, by constructing the free energy and entropy implicitly defined by the data. With this structure established, one can examine the consistency of time integration schemes with these prescriptions. Using chemical potentials, one can compute the respective contributions of the kinetics model and of the temporal scheme to free energy/entropy variations, and develop more robust schemes.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77156' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(679)' class='star'><span class='star679'>&star;</span></a> Dimitri Goutaudier  <span id='bitlink-2533'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2533)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2533' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2533)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Real-Time Parametric Adaptation of Digital Twins</b><br />Dimitri Goutaudier<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-149.html'>Digital Twins for Intelligent Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>Digital twin frameworks more and more resort to projection-based reduced order models (ROM) to perform real time simulations of complex systems. Several reduced bases may be simultaneously manipulated, either to project the equations onto a lower dimensional subspace, or to approximate nonlinear terms resisting the real time constraint. These reduced bases are often computed with the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) which requires snapshots of the solution for a given set of parameters. A difficulty then arises when it comes to adapt both efficiently and accurately these multiple reduced bases for new set of parameters.    
In this contribution, we compare different state of the art approaches to build the parametric reduced order model of a gas bearings dynamical system. We revisit the Interpolation on the Tangent Space of the Grassmann Manifold (ITSGM) technique, and we propose several improvements.

With the ease of accessibility of data, learning models directly from the data have recently drawn much attention. Constructing simple and compact models describing complex nonlinear dynamics is also desirable for efficient engineering studies on modest computer hardware. To achieve our goal, we focus on the lifting principles--that is, sufficiently smooth nonlinear systems can be rewritten as quadratic models in an appropriate coordinate system. Therefore, we focus on identifying suitable coordinate systems such that a quadratic model can describe the dynamics in the obtained coordinate system. To determine such a coordinate system, we leverage the powerful expressive capabilities of deep learning, particularly autoencoders. Moreover, in several physical systems where energy preservation is preserved, we focus on identifying the coordinate systems that can also preserve energy. We illustrate the methodologies to learn the desired coordinate systems for nonlinear dynamical models by illustrative examples.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75423' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(612)' class='star'><span class='star612'>&star;</span></a> Carmen Graessle  <span id='bitlink-2535'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2535)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2535' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2535)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reduced Order Data Assimilation for Damage Parameter Estimation in Composite Structures</b><br />Carmen Graessle<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-134.html'>Perspectives on Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>In order to identify damages in fiber metal laminates, we utilize techniques of Bayesian analysis and data assimilation for (damage) parameter estimation.

The unconditional SSP property for a method of order p>2 is unique among SSP methods, and depends on a backward-in-time assumption on the derivative of the operator. We show that this backward derivative condition is satisfied in many relevant cases where SSP IMEX schemes are desired. We devise unconditionally SSP implicit Runge-Kutta schemes of order up to p=4, and IMEX Runge-Kutta schemes of order up to p=3. For the multi-derivative IMEX schemes, we also derive and present the order conditions, which have not appeared previously. The unconditional SSP condition ensures that these methods are positivity preserving, and we present sufficient conditions under which such methods are also asymptotic preserving when applied to a range of problems, including a hyperbolic relaxation system, the Broadwell model, and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) kinetic equation. We present numerical results to support the theoretical results, on a variety of problems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75640' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1221)' class='star'><span class='star1221'>&star;</span></a> Damien Gratadour  <span id='bitlink-2538'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2538)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2538' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2538)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Mixed Precision Linear Algebra for High Fidelity Real-Time Wavefront Reconstruction on Giant Optical Telescopes</b><br />Damien Gratadour<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-268.html'>Approximate Computing for Scientific Applications - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>While the largest ground-based telescopes will soon reach 40m diameter to provide means required to detect faint rocky exoplanets, they must overcome optical distortions induced by atmospheric turbulence. This is done thanks to Adaptive Optics (AO) employing a real-time controller (RTC), operating at high speed (1kHz) to catch up with the rapidly changing optical turbulence, and responsible for reconstructing aberrations measured by wavefront sensors (WFS) to drivel deformable mirrors (DM) actuators used to compensate them. In particular Multi-Conjugate AO uses tomographic reconstruction in a linear control scheme: input measurements from several sensors are multiplied by a control matrix to produce an output command vector to drive several DMs. In this context, I will present the various avenues for leveraging approximate computing within the AO RTC. Taking benefit from sensors data coarse grain quantization, mixed precision approximations can be used in the real-time control loop to minimize the servo lag and maximize AO end-to-end performance. Additionally, whilst the tomographic reconstructor must be updated in quasi-real-time, the associated computational burden can be significantly relaxed through mixed precision linear algebra, leveraging intrinsic data sparsity from input matrices, with the goal to either come-up with more complex high-fidelity control schemes or optimize the computer system dimensioning with impact on construction, operation and maintenance costs.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75608' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1419)' class='star'><span class='star1419'>&star;</span></a> Daniel T.

The mapping from the former to the latter must be determined from noisy experiments or from expensive simulations. We abstract this problem to a mathematical framework in which an unknown function from a control space to a design space must be ascertained by means of expensive noisy measurements, which locate optimal control settings generating desired design features within specified tolerances, with quantified uncertainty. We describe targeted adaptive design (TAD), a new algorithm that performs this optimal sampling task. TAD creates a Gaussian process surrogate model of the unknown mapping at each iterative stage, proposing a new batch of control settings to sample experimentally and optimizing the updated log-predictive likelihood of the target design. TAD either stops upon locating a solution with uncertainties that fit inside the tolerance box or uses a measure of expected future information to determine that the search space has been exhausted with no solution. TAD thus embodies the exploration-exploitation tension in a manner that recalls, but is essentially different from, Bayesian optimization and optimal experimental design.

The discretization leads to a mildly nonsymmetric double saddle-point linear system. We identify numerical properties and exploit the sparsity structure of the matrix, for the purpose of developing a fast preconditioned iterative solution procedure. The proposed preconditioners are based on approximations of two Schur complements that arise in decompositional relations associated with the double saddle-point matrix and its blocks. We analyze the eigenvalue distribution of the preconditioned matrices with respect to the physical parameters of the problem and show that the eigenvalues are strongly clustered. Consequently, preconditioned GMRES appears to be relatively insensitive to the mesh size and the physical parameters involved.

Radiosity works by computing the pairwise light transfer between surface patches in a scene, which are determined by enforcing strict local radiation balance.    
In this talk, we present our approach to revive the radiosity method by using a distributed octree data structure, where the Morton space-filling curve and the octree's inherent recursivity lend themselves to handle spatial data in parallel.  This research is an initial step towards parallel adaptive in-situ visualization that utilizes a widely known simulation data structure.    
The MPI parallelization of the radiosity method is a challenging task since the calculations to detect occluding surfaces are highly non-local, and this non-locality of relevant data requires communication schemes that limit the communication runtime overhead by asynchronous point-to-point MPI messages. Using this approach, we improved the strong scaling of the radiosity method.    
We present the current state of our research, an adaptive, parallel and natively supported radiosity solver operating on a distributed octree data structure and focus on the parallelization and our scalability results.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75741' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1675)' class='star'><span class='star1675'>&star;</span></a> Boyce E.

In such fluid-structure systems, it is common for the intrinsic timescales of the fluid and structure to differ, sometimes by orders of magnitude. However, it can be challenging to decouple these time scales in conventional IB formulations of fluid-structure interaction (FSI). This talk will outline a new sharp-interface approach to FSI that leverages a coupling scheme based on the immersed interface method. We use a penalty method to couple the fluid and structure that makes it straightforward to advance fluid and structure variables at different time step sizes, and we investigate the impact of multi-rate schemes on the accuracy and efficiency of the methodology in a range of benchmark cases and large-scale applications.

Recently there have been a number of attempts to speed up this process using neural networks.  Among these is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as surrogate models for CFD simulations with varying geometries; see, e.g., [1].  Here, the model is trained on images of high-fidelity simulation results. However, the generation of training data is expensive and this approach usually requires a large data set.  Thus, it is of interest to be able to train a CNN in the absence of abundant training data with the help of physical constraints.  First results have already been achieved for the heat equation on a fixed geometry and flow problems in parameterizable geometries; see [2, 3].  In this talk, we present a physics-aware approach to train CNNs as surrogate models for CFD simulations in varying geometries.  The employed CNN takes an imags of the geometry as input and returns images of the associated CFD simulation results, i.e., velocity and pressure, as output.  Our CNN architecture is based on the structure of U-Net \cite{RFB:2015:UNET}.  Since the model is trained on pixel images, it can be applied to a variety of different geometries.  We show results for two-dimensional flows around obstacles of varying size and placement and in non-rectangular geometries, esp. arteries and aneurysms.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75441' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(793)' class='star'><span class='star793'>&star;</span></a> Stefano Grivet-Talocia  <span id='bitlink-2546'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2546)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2546' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2546)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Enforcing Uniform Stability and Passivity in Data-Driven Multivariate Model Order Reduction</b><br />Stefano Grivet-Talocia<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-173.html'>System-Theoretic Learning Methods and Model Reduction -  - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>We present a comprehensive framework for data-driven model order reduction of parameterized Linear and Time-Invariant systems, with explicit certification of model stability and dissipativity.

Lack of these properties makes the models practically useless in any simulation setting in which they are used as components, as in Computer Aided Design of electrical and electronic systems.    
The proposed approach builds on    	 a particular model structure, which casts the transfer function of the model as a ratio of two rational functions, each with constant predefined &#8220;basis' poles and parameter-dependent residues;  	 a parameterization of the above residues expressed in a Berstein polynomial basis, whose partition of unity and positivity are exploited in the derivation of our main result and algorithms;  	 availability of sampled responses in frequency and parameter domain, that are fitted by the model through an iterative reweighted linear Least Squares (LS) process;  	 the above LS problems is complemented by an explicit, purely algebraic (finite-size) set of constraints that are sufficient for both uniform stability and uniform dissipativity in the parameter space; these constraints provide the key novelty in this contribution.

Here A denotes the coefficient operator for the Lyapunov equation. A spectral theoretic setting of Babuska and Osborn is used both to define measures of the approximation error as well as to prove the reliability of the error estimator. On the example of the Laplace operator on the dumbbell domain we achieve eight figures of accuracy for computing the trace of the solution of the Lyapunov equation using a finite element space of dimension of only 1e4 degrees of freedom.

Therefore, we can identify systems where an efficient approximation of a control Lyapunov function via neural networks is possible. Moreover, suitable network architectures and training algorithms for the computation of control Lyapunov functions are presented. We also discuss aspects of the more general case of an optimal control problem and the approximation of a compositional optimal value function.

The problem of nowcasting extreme weather events can be addressed by applying either numerical methods for the solution of dynamic model equations or data-driven artificial intelligence techniques.  In this talk, we focus on this second approach. In detail, we present   a novel method based on ensemble deep learning that exploits a deep neural network that takes as input time series of multichannel radar reflectivity images and provides as output the probability that an extreme event occurs, where the extreme event is defined on the basis of a certain level of precipitation and lightning density. One of the main novelty is the   use of value-weighted skill scores in the ensemble procedure and for assessing the forecasting performance: such value-weighted skill scores allow ranking prediction errors on the basis of their distribution along time, preferring to show up a warning well in advance of the actual   occurrence of an event rather than not to show it at all. The results of this study is a data-driven warning system for supporting the decision-making in the case of extreme rainfall events tailored for the Liguria region in Italy.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75834' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(344)' class='star'><span class='star344'>&star;</span></a> Stefanie Guenther  <span id='bitlink-2553'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2553)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2553' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2553)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Leveraging Quantum Decoherence for Fast Ground State Reset and Pure-State Preparation</b><br />Stefanie Guenther<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-75.html'>Optimal Control of Open Quantum Systems - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>A key requirement for building general purpose quantum computers is the ability to perform fast and accurate state preparation, e.g. to initialize quantum algorithms into well defined states, for fault-tolerant quantum memory, or quantum correction schemes requiring a continuous supply of qubits in a low-entropy state, such as the ground state. Unconditional quantum state preparation requires the system under study to be coupled to a quantum dissipative channel, allowing for entropy exchange between the system of interest and a bath. In this talk, we will present a framework for encouraging these processes through driven controls that are optimally designed using numerical optimal control techniques on classical HPC platforms.  We model the underlying quantum dynamics in terms of the density matrix satisfying Lindblad's master equation, driven by control pulses whose frequencies precisely trigger qubit state transitions, and apply gradient-based optimization to design optimal control pulse shapes. Utilizing a specific optimization objective, we show how an ensemble of initial density matrices can be used as a single initial state throughout the optimization process, while achieving the desired target state for any initial qubit state. The scheme enables automated design of optimal state preparation protocols that achieve faster ground state reset than traditional protocols as well as general pure-state preparation targeting decoherence-protected qubits.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75325' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(122)' class='star'><span class='star122'>&star;</span></a> Fernando Guevara Vasquez  <span id='bitlink-2554'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2554)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2554' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2554)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Finding the Conductivity on a Graph from Internal Power Measurements</b><br />Fernando Guevara Vasquez<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-27.html'>Reduced Order Models for Applications in Graphs and Inverse Problems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>We consider the problem of finding the resistors in a resistor network from knowing the power dissipated by each of the resistors under different imposed voltages at certain nodes.

A collaboration with the Swiss Plasma Center institute led to the development of a new method in order to accelerate the solution of consecutive linear systems which can arise from such simulations. A system of differential algebraic equations is obtained from the 3D drift-reduced Brangiskii equations that model plasma dynamics in the edge layer of the tokamak. The explicit time integration of such a system yields the need for solving a sequence of consecutive linear systems, for which both the matrix and the right-hand-side are time-dependent. As the time step is constrained to remain small, a very large number of systems need to be solved, dominating the computational time. In order to mitigate this, we leverage the history of previous time solutions in order to reduce, sometimes drastically, the number of iterations needed by the linear systems solver. Taking inspiration by existing methods for implicitly discretized nonlinear evolution problems, our approach is based on combining the solution of a reduced order model with randomization. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated for academic problems as well as large-scale plasma simulations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75404' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(729)' class='star'><span class='star729'>&star;</span></a> Vincenzo Gulizzi  <span id='bitlink-2557'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2557)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2557' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2557)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High-Order Accurate Unified Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Fluid and Solid Mechanics</b><br />Vincenzo Gulizzi<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-160.html'>Geometric Mechanics Formulations and Associated Structure-Preserving Discretizations for Fluids - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>A novel high-order accurate computational framework for a unified treatment of fluid and solid mechanic problems is presented.

A single formulation for both solids and fluids is obtained by a special expression of the elliptic operator.  High-order accuracy in space is achieved by discretizing these operators via suitably-introduced discontinuous Galerkin methods, which lead to block-structured mass matrices, enable a natural way to treat generally-shaped mesh elements, and are amenable to massive parallelization.  Numerical examples are provided to model fluids within the incompressibility regime, generally anisotropic solids and fluid-solid interaction problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75455' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(601)' class='star'><span class='star601'>&star;</span></a> Ling Guo  <span id='bitlink-2558'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2558)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2558' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2558)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Mutual Information Based Uncertainty Quantification in Scientific Machine Learning</b><br />Ling Guo<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-132.html'>Recent Advances in Modeling, Simulation, and Sampling via Artificial Intelligence for Physical Sciences and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Neural networks (NNs) are currently changing the computational paradigm on how to combine data with mathematical laws in physics and engineering in a profound way, tackling challenging inverse and ill-posed problems not solvable with traditional methods.

The first method is the Bayesian reduced-order operator inference, a non-intrusive, ‘glass-box’ approach that inherits the formulation structure of projection-based, reduced-state governing equations yet without requiring access to the full-order solvers. The reduced-order operators are learned using Bayesian inference with Gaussian priors and recovered as posterior Gaussian distributions conditioning on projected state data, which provides a quantification of modeling uncertainties and a naturally embedded Tikhonov regularization. The second method employs deep kernel learning, a manifold Gaussian process with a deep neural network embedded inside, for the data-driven reduced-order modeling from high-dimensional measurements given by noise-corrupted images. Such a probabilistic deep learning model is utilized for both dimensionality reduction and the representation of reduced-order dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of deep kernel learning in the denoising and uncertainty quantification of reduced models. The first method is a joint work with S. A. McQuarrie and K. E. Willcox (UT Austin), while the second with N. Botteghi and C. Brune (UTwente).    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75420' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(76)' class='star'><span class='star76'>&star;</span></a> Wei Guo  <span id='bitlink-2560'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2560)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2560' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2560)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Local Macroscopic Conservative Low Rank Tensor Method for the Vlasov Dynamics</b><br />Wei Guo<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-17.html'>Low-Rank Approximation for Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we introduce a novel Local Macroscopic Conservative (LoMaC) low rank tensor method for simulating the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) and Vlasov-Maxwell (VM) systems. The LoMaC property refers to the exact local conservation of macroscopic mass, momentum and energy at the discrete level. This is a follow-up work of our previous development of a conservative low rank tensor approach for Vlasov dynamics (arXiv:2201.10397). In that work, we applied a low rank tensor method with a conservative singular value decomposition (SVD) to the high dimensional VP/VM system to mitigate the curse of dimensionality, while maintaining the local conservation of mass and momentum. However, energy conservation is not guaranteed, which is a critical property to avoid unphysical plasma self-heating or cooling. The new ingredient in the LoMaC low rank tensor algorithm is that we simultaneously evolve the macroscopic conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy using a flux-difference form with kinetic flux vector splitting; then the LoMaC property is realized by projecting the low rank kinetic solution onto a subspace that shares the same macroscopic observables by a conservative orthogonal projection. The algorithm is extended to the high dimensional problems by hierarchical Tuck decomposition of solution tensors and a corresponding conservative projection algorithm. Extensive numerical tests on the VP and VM systems are showcased for the algorithm's efficacy.

The effects of fluid elasticity on motility remain poorly understood, partly because, the swimmer strokes depend on the properties of the fluid medium, which obfuscates the mechanisms responsible for observed behavioral changes.  Gait adaptation is essential for biological function, but how organisms adapt their gait and the significance of these changes for biological function are not known. We use computational and mathematical modeling to (1) disentangle these affects by changing the gait and fluid rheology independently and to (2) examine how the swimmer gait emerges from the properties of the environment. We present a series of problems of increasing complexity: prescribed gait, prescribed motor activity, and fully emergent motion.

From gradient-based optimization over uncertainty quantification to the incorporation of machine learning approaches into our simulation workflows, the ability to obtain gradients of our simulation code determines our ability to access this exceedingly large toolbox. But for a large number of our simulations the rewriting of entire simulations in differentiable domain-specific languages such as JAX or PyTorch is simply infeasible. Compiler-based automatic differentiation with Enzyme enables the synthesization of gradients even for these simulations in any language which utilizes LLVM in their compiler such as e.g. C/C++, Julia, Fortran, Rust, and Swift. This tight integration into the compiler enables Enzyme to synthesize much more efficient gradients by operating on representations already optimized by the compiler.  In this talk we present key extensions to Enzyme which enable the auto-batching of operations inside of Enzyme to convert scalar functions into vectorized functions for more efficient gradients in downstream applications.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75887' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1616)' class='star'><span class='star1616'>&star;</span></a> Bernard Haasdonk  <span id='bitlink-2567'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2567)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2567' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2567)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>PDE-Greedy Kernel Methods for Adaptive Approximation of Partial Differential Equations</b><br />Bernard Haasdonk<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-357.html'>Efficient Kernel Methods - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>Kernel greedy methods have been shown to be provably and empirically efficient for general function approximation tasks.

We provide analytical results on convergence rates and demonstrate the applicability by computational experiments for elliptic PDEs.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75784' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(855)' class='star'><span class='star855'>&star;</span></a> Eldad Haber  <span id='bitlink-2568'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2568)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2568' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2568)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Estimating a Potential Without the Agony of the Partition Function</b><br />Eldad Haber<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-187.html'>Advances in Integrating Graphs, PDEs, and Machine Learning</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75490' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(465)' class='star'><span class='star465'>&star;</span></a> Andreas Hadjigeorgiou  <span id='bitlink-2569'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2569)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2569' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2569)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimizing Wavefield-Modelling for Seismic Inversion Applications on HPC Architectures</b><br />Andreas Hadjigeorgiou<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-103.html'>Performance Engineering and Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>The seismic imaging process aims at creating an image of the subsurface layer interfaces by acoustic reflection measurements along the surface of the Earth. In many of such algorithms so-called one-way depth propagation of acoustic wavefields is the core mechanism, in order to reconstruct the acoustic waves as they would have occurred inside the Earth. Such process allows finding out where the reflections have occurred and with which strength. The computational efficiency of these applications resolves to the efficiency of the underlying wavefield propagator. An algorithm that has been proposed in the literature is the Phase-Shift Plus Interpolation, which handles wave propagation through inhomogeneous media by phase-shift propagation with a set of reference velocities - each assuming a local homogeneous medium - and a spatial interpolation mechanism. One objective of our work is to deliver a performance-portable wavefield propagation solver for various computer architectures. Our approach to this is to provide the algorithm through an architecture-agnostic interface, developed based on C++ templates, which at compile-time resolves to an architecture-specific back-end. We develop the OpenMP back-end for threaded parallelism on CPUs, CUDA for acceleration on Nvidia GPUs, and HIP for porting CUDA to AMD GPUs. To evaluate the efficiency of the implementations we use the roofline model. In this presentation we will describe our implementation and show some benchmark results.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75374' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(549)' class='star'><span class='star549'>&star;</span></a> Yiannis Hadjimichael  <span id='bitlink-2570'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2570)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2570' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2570)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Implementation of Implicit Runge&#8211;Kutta Methods with Downwind-Biased Operators</b><br />Yiannis Hadjimichael<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-120.html'>Structure-Preserving Time-Stepping Methods for Differential Equations</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>Strong stability preserving (SSP) time integrators have been developed to preserve certain nonlinear stability  properties of the numerical solution in arbitrary norms, when coupled with suitable spatial discretizations.  The existing general linear methods either attain small time steps for strong stability preservation or are only  first-order accurate.  One way to relax the time-step restrictions is to consider time integrators that contain both upwind- and  downwind-biased operators.  In this talk, we review downwind SSP Runge-Kutta (DWRK) methods in the framework of perturbations of  classical Runge-Kutta methods. We show how downwinding improves the SSP properties of time-stepping  methods and breaks some stability barriers.  In particular, we focus on a novel one-parameter family of implicit DWRK methods for which the SSP coefficient  varies with respect to the method's coefficients and the CFL-like restriction can be arbitrarily large.  We analyze the stability and accuracy of such methods for large CFL numbers.  Finally, we discuss the computational complexity of implicit DWRK methods, and we propose a block factorization  of the Jacobian that enhances the solution of Newton's method.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75406' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1563)' class='star'><span class='star1563'>&star;</span></a> Maria Hadjimina  <span id='bitlink-2571'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2571)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2571' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2571)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Experiences with the SmartPool Project in Cyprus</b><br />Maria Hadjimina<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-344.html'>Raising Mathematical Awareness via the SmartPool Project</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75756' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(462)' class='star'><span class='star462'>&star;</span></a> Georg Hager  <span id='bitlink-2572'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2572)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2572' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2572)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Performance Engineering in CSE: A Bird's Eye View</b><br />Georg Hager<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-103.html'>Performance Engineering and Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Performance Engineering (PE) in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) has two goals: First, to understand the performance bottlenecks of a code, and second, to use this insight to apply changes that will improve performance. There is a wide spectrum of workflows and tools in this field, but all have in common that the whole PE process is iterative, yielding  improvements until some preset target is achieved or some other criterion is met (such as "I've done enough").    
This talk gives an overview of methods, tools, and metrics that are in use for Performance Engineering in CSE. Some, but not all PE activities are well defined in the sense of a prescribed workflow, and we try to accommodate that by building mostly on examples from performance research, performance tools development, and performance-aware application development. Whichever strategy is applied, performance patterns can help to build a better understanding of the performance issues at hand. We will describe typical performance patterns and how they can serve to accelerate the PE process.

However, physical systems are often described by action principles associated with Euler-Lagrange equations in second order form. Although in many cases it is possible to associate these equations with first order systems, the change in form requires additional initial and boundary conditions, so that their sollutions will agree only if certain (possibly nonlinear) constraints are satisfied. In this talk we will present a construction of discontinuous Galerkin discretizations which can be directly applied to the second order Euler-Lagrange equations. We consider as our model systems the so-called regularly hyperbolic systems introduced by Christodoulou ( The Action Principle and Partial Differential Equations, 2000). These possess leading order terms satisfying an energy equality which we can use to define numerical fluxes and establish stability of the schemes. Some examples from gravitational wave theory are given to illustrate the construction.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75522' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(293)' class='star'><span class='star293'>&star;</span></a> Harri H.

We model the drum as an elastic membrane and compute the associated variable diffusion eigenproblem, where the diffusion can be interpreted for instance as the tension of the drum. We choose as the shape of a drum a disk with a cut sector. In this case the exact eigenvalues for the constant coefficient problem are known, and the non-symmetric domain guarantees that there are no clusters of eigenvalues at the low end of the spectrum. This is an important property of the problem, since as the diffusion coefficient is perturbed, not only do the eigenvalues change but the order of the modes can change too. This phenomenon is referred to as mixing of modes. The numerical experiments are computed with hp-FEM where it is ensured that the discretisation is such that in the reference case all first 60 eigenpairs are in correct order. Thus, when in the perturbed cases mixing is observed, we can with high confidence say that it is due to the variation of the tension of the drum. Using this setup we can sample the coefficients from given distributions and observe the responses.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75306' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2025)' class='star'><span class='star2025'>&star;</span></a> Carole Hall  <span id='bitlink-2575'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2575)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2575' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2575)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Physics of Penguins: Super-Resolving Imagery of Ad&#233;lie Penguin Colonies</b><br />Carole Hall<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-423.html'>Student Days: Student Chapter Presentations - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Determining the drivers of abundance trends in populations is key to effectively implementing environmental policy and conservation. An abundance of data necessary to understand these relationships are at fine spatial scales, and to accurately gauge trends it is imperative to include historical time series information. Antarctic seabirds are important indicators of climate change, but the costly resources required to travel to and gather data in Antarctica underline the need for heightened reliance on remote surveillance methods such as satellite imagery. Unfortunately, large proportions of long-term available imagery are of poor quality. We present methods to super-resolve information from low resolution satellite imagery to uncover the spatial dynamics of Adélie penguin colonies. Additionally, we uncover the quantitative relationship between Adélie penguin colony configurations and molecular physics that has previously been unreported. In this project, we aim to better equip scientists with tools to study population dynamics with data captured from satellite imagery when high-resolution images are limited or unavailable.

The main difficulty of this equation is that it is not only indefinite, but it contains differential operators with opposite signs, and recently its well-posedness was analyzed in [M. Halla, T. Hohage, On the well-posedness of the damped time-harmonic Galbrun equation and the equations of stellar oscillations, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53(4) (2021), pp. 4068–4095]. In this talk we discuss how to construct and analyze convergent discretizations. To this end we report a new weak T-compatibility framework and apply it to certain $H^1$-conforming finite element methods. The main assumption on the finite element spaces is a uniformly stable invertibility of the divergence operator, which is ensured under certain conditions on the meshes and the polynomial degree. Thus we obtain a family of reliable finite element methods, for which we present computational results. Details can be found in the report [M. Halla, C. Lehrenfeld, P. Stocker, A new T-compatibility condition and its application to the discretization of the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation, arXiv:2209.01878].    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75521' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(180)' class='star'><span class='star180'>&star;</span></a> Edward Hall&#233;-Hannan  <span id='bitlink-2578'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2578)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2578' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2578)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A General Blackbox Optimization Framework for Hyperparameter Optimization in Deep Learning</b><br />Edward Hall&#233;-Hannan<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-39.html'>Recent Advances in Stochastic Optimization and Computational Game Theory - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>The uprising of deep learning has brought new challenges in the blackbox optimization (BBO) community. Notably, tuning the hyperparameters of a deep model is a mixed-variable BBO problem with an unfixed structure. For instance, the number of hidden layers, which is itself a hyperparameter, affects the number of hyperparameters regarding the units in the architecture of the model. Moreover, the hyperparameter optimization problem (HPO) may simultaneously contain categorical, integer and continuous variables. In conjunction, the diversity of variable types and the unfixed structure of the HPO create a substantial challenge in a BBO context. To tackle the HPO, we meticulously developed a mathematical framework that properly models the class of problems of interest. Meta variables are introduced to model variables that influence which variables are included or excluded. In essence, meta variables model the unfixed structure of the problem, and they may affect the dimension of the problem. Many algorithmic subtleties and implications are outlined by the mathematical framework, which ease the development of optimization methods. A simple HPO problem is illustrated throughout the presentation and solution strategies to tackle meta and categorical variables are discussed with different approaches, such as direct search, heuristics and Bayesian optimization.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75255' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(299)' class='star'><span class='star299'>&star;</span></a> George Haller  <span id='bitlink-2579'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2579)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2579' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2579)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Learning Nonlinear Reduced Models on Spectral Submanifolds from Data</b><br />George Haller<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-66.html'>Nonlinear Approximations of Latent Dynamics for Model Reduction and Beyond - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>We discuss a recent dynamical systems alternative to neural networks in the data-driven reduced-order modeling of nonlinear phenomena.

However, VFM faces difficulties where plane-stress assumptions break down, and FEMU remains challenging when calibrating complex models where computational inefficiencies of the inverse problem are intractable. In this presentation a novel physics informed neural network (PINN) architecture for calibration and discovery of hyperelastic constitutive models will be proposed which alleviates some of the weaknesses of VFM and FEMU due to the interpolation power of neural networks. Our architecture consists of radial basis function neural networks and input convex neural networks as a constitutive model surrogate trained with a combined least-squares and gradient descent update. This approach ensures that conservation of momentum is obeyed to higher precision then typical PINNs while searching for constitutive models that obey convexity and thus material stability. Exemplars utilizing synthetic experimental data will be shown that are illustrative of typical mechanical test specimens with non-homogenous strain fields.

Due to the issue of empty cells, a smoothed location model (smoothed LM) is introduced. However, the smoothing process caused changes in the original information of the non-empty cells. It is well known that original information is valuable and important that should be maintained. Thus, a new strategy is proposed by amalgamating of maximum likelihood and smoothing estimations to construct a new LM. Consequently, maximum likelihood estimation will be used if the cell was found to be non-empty, otherwise smoothing estimation will be used instead. The analysis shows that the newly constructed LM can provide optimal classification results and demonstrates better performance compared to the old models, i.e. classical LM and smoothed LM, where the estimation used is based on the cell’s conditions. The new proposed strategy of parameter estimation could handle all situations; whether the cells are empty or not, limited sample size with many variables measured mainly the binary.      </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75637' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(498)' class='star'><span class='star498'>&star;</span></a> Steven Hamilton  <span id='bitlink-2582'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2582)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2582' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2582)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Preconditioning a GPU-Enabled Compressible CFD Solver</b><br />Steven Hamilton<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-110.html'>Parallel Linear Solvers for Ill-Conditioned Engineering Design Problems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Oak Ridge National Laboratory is developing the Spinnaker code, an implicit time-dependent compressible-flow computational fluid dynamics solver targeting a variety of fluid flow applications. Spinnaker is built using finite element assembly, linear algebra, and automatic differentiation capabilities from the Trilinos code library. The Kokkos performance portability layer allows kernels to be compiled for several different computing architectures, including multithreaded CPUs, Nvidia GPUs, and AMD GPUs.    
Spinnaker uses an implicit time-stepping approach with Newton's method as a nonlinear solver within each time step. GMRES (potentially with restarting) is typically used as the linear solver. The preconditioner selection has primarily focused on overlapping additive Schwarz type preconditioners with a sparse direct solver used for the local domain blocks. Preconditioners based on incomplete factorizations (also within an additive Schwarz approach) and algebraic multigrid methods have also been evaluated.     
This talk will provide an evaluation of the linear solvers and preconditioners used within Spinnaker for several compressible 2D and 3D fluid flow problems.

Dissipative weak solutions (DWS) have demonstrated their capability analytically and numerically to be the right solution concept to the Euler equations of gas dynamics when strong solutions are not attainable. In this talk, I will talk about the notion of DWS in the context of Euler equations. Furthermore, in this talk, I will present a convergence analysis of the MUSCL scheme and a high-order finite method, the spectral difference method. Namely, we show that structure preserving properties, such as positivity preservation and entropy inequality hold. We demonstrate how to ensure them and prove the convergence of our multidimensional high-order scheme via dissipative weak solutions. Lastly, we demonstrate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations of turbulent flows.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75776' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1996)' class='star'><span class='star1996'>&star;</span></a> Maria Han Veiga  <span id='bitlink-2584'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2584)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2584' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2584)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Bayesian Scientific Computing and Probabilistic Programming: Inside and Outside the &#8220;Black Box&#8221;</b><br />Maria Han Veiga<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-413.html'>Bayesian Scientific Computing and Probabilistic Programming: Inside and Outside the “Black Box” - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77163' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2000)' class='star'><span class='star2000'>&star;</span></a> Maria Han Veiga  <span id='bitlink-2585'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2585)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2585' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2585)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Bayesian Scientific Computing and Probabilistic Programming: Inside and Outside the &#8220;Black Box&#8221;</b><br />Maria Han Veiga<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-414.html'>Bayesian Scientific Computing and Probabilistic Programming: Inside and Outside the “Black Box” - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77164' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2034)' class='star'><span class='star2034'>&star;</span></a> Fuqun Han  <span id='bitlink-2586'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2586)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2586' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2586)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Direct Sampling Methods for Recovering Inhomogeneous Inclusions of Different Nature</b><br />Fuqun Han<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-423.html'>Student Days: Student Chapter Presentations - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we shall address some effective and robust direct sampling methods for simultaneously recovering inhomogeneous inclusions arising from two different physical coefficients in the typical elliptic PDE model and the electromagnetic system.

As tKGs dynamically evolves, the low-rank approximation embedding approaches should be empowered to capture temporal dynamics on tKGs. In this talk, we would like to introduce two approaches specified for tKG with two different perspectives. Firstly, the existing approaches model the tKGs in discrete state spaces while links on tKGs often vary continuously over time. To this end, we propose a novel continuum model by extending the idea of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to modeling tKGs. The proposed model preserves the continuous nature of dynamic multi-relational graph data and encodes both temporal and structural information into continuous-time dynamic embeddings. Secondly, tKGs often exhibit multiple simultaneous non-Euclidean structures. However, existing embedding approaches for temporal KGs typically learn entity representations and their dynamic evolution in Euclidean space, which might not capture such intrinsic structures very well. Thus, we propose DyERNIE, a non-Euclidean embedding approach that learns evolving entity representations in a product of Riemannian manifolds. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark tKG datasets, demonstrating the proposed methods' superior performance.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75496' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1452)' class='star'><span class='star1452'>&star;</span></a> Kathrin Hanauer  <span id='bitlink-2588'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2588)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2588' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2588)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimal Link Scheduling via Subgraph Coloring</b><br />Kathrin Hanauer<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-320.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>In datacenters, optical technologies allow the establishment of a limited set of additional direct connections of high bandwidth between pairs of top-of-rack switches.

This will include a recent history of localization of kernels and conclude with very recent progress and accompanying improvements to a variety of kernel based methods for solving PDEs on manifolds. These include new stable and efficient multigrid methods for Galerkin problems using localized kernel bases, as well as improvements to kernel-FD and asymmetric collocation for time dependent and independent PDEs.

We present here an expression of the equations in the exterior calculus formalism and how the desired properties on the scheme guide the different choices made during the discretization.  Finally we look more concretely at the resulting scheme by showing the well-posedness of the problem, by analyzing the error and the preservation of the quantities, and with a numerical simulation.

The mechanical properties of such aggregates are influenced by their microstructure and their interaction with the flow during formation. However, due to technical limitations, it is difficult to study the intrathrombus conditions of platelet aggregates only by experimental or computational approaches.  In this work, an image-based computational model is proposed based on two sets of microscopy images of three different platelet aggregates formed under different external flow rates to study the blood flow behavior within such aggregates. These image sets are captured from whole blood perfused microfluidic chambers coated with collagen. One set of images captured the shape of the aggregate outline, while the other employed platelet labeling to infer the internal density. The platelet aggregates are considered as porous mediums. The computational model is subsequently applied to study the blood flow behavior and the interaction between the platelet aggregates and the blood flow under different shear rates. The penetration depth, represented by the boundary of convective and diffusive transport, is also investigated. The results show that external flow velocity has a significant influence on the agonist transport in the outer layers of the aggregate, while the internal core stably remains in the diffusion dominated regime.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75250' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1661)' class='star'><span class='star1661'>&star;</span></a> Reza Haqshenas  <span id='bitlink-2593'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2593)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2593' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2593)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fast and Accurate Boundary Element Methods for Large-Scale Computational Acoustics</b><br />Reza Haqshenas<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-367.html'>Boundary Integral Equations, Boundary Element Methods, and Applications - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>The Helmholtz equation can be numerically solved using the boundary element method (BEM) by reformulating the volumetric partial differential equation as a boundary integral equation on the surface of the scatterers. The explicit use of Green’s functions avoids domain truncation of unbounded regions and accurately models wave propagation through homogeneous domains. Triangular surface grids with few linear elements per wavelength suffice to discretize the boundary integral operators with a Galerkin method. However, the dense matrices require a large amount of memory, and the convergence of iterative linear solvers deteriorates at high frequencies and large material contrasts relative to the exterior medium. This talk presents novel preconditioning techniques for coupled BEM formulations modelling multiple scattering and transmission through on-surface radiation conditions that are especially effective at high frequencies. Also, we designed novel boundary integral formulations that are well-conditioned when different domains have high contrasts in density or speed of sound. We used our fast BEM implementation to simulate focused ultrasound propagation in the human body, which can be translated to important biomedical applications such as the non-invasive treatment of liver cancer and neuromodulation of the brain. We validated the methodology within an international benchmarking exercise and implemented all functionality in our open-source Python library, OptimUS.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75804' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1197)' class='star'><span class='star1197'>&star;</span></a> Maciej Haranczyk  <span id='bitlink-2594'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2594)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2594' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2594)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Geometry and Topology Analysis of Characterization and Discovery of Porous Material Structures</b><br />Maciej Haranczyk<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-263.html'>Computational Geometrical and Topological Tools and Their Applications</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Nanoporous materials such have been of growing importance as materials for adsorption-based applications such as CO2 capture, hydrogen and methane storage, as well as for many others applications, for example, as catalysts. A vast majority of nanoporous materials are based on modular chemistry, which enables construction of chemical structures using various building blocks. As the result, a huge number of material structures can be obtained. Novel tools are required to sieve through these possible structures to identify ones with the desired properties for a given application. Our group has been developing such tools by exploiting computational geometry and topology approaches such as Voronoi tessellation and persistence homology. We have gained the ability to detect and characterize porosity features across various length scales important for adsorption processes, and we successfully used these features to build machine learning structure-property models. This presentation will summarize these developments and hint towards new applications in the analysis of porous material structures.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75601' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1609)' class='star'><span class='star1609'>&star;</span></a> Helmut Harbrecht  <span id='bitlink-2595'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2595)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2595' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2595)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Shape Optimization for Parabolic Problems on Time-Dependent Domains</b><br />Helmut Harbrecht<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-355.html'>New Developments in Shape, Topology and Tubular Optimization - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>This talk is concerned with the solution of time-dependent shape optimization problems.

The Factorization Method uses Picard’s Criteria to define an indicator function to image an unknown region. In most applications, the data operator is compact which gives that the singular values can tend to zero rapidly which can cause numerical instabilities. The regularization of the Factorization Method presented here seeks to avoid the numerical instabilities in applying Picard’s Criteria. This method allows one to image the interior structure of an object with little a priori information in a computationally simple and analytically rigorous way. Here we will focus on an application of this method to diffuse optical tomography which will prove that this method can be used to recover an unknown subregion from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping.

The mathematical models for  the genetic toggle switch that currently exist have been useful in describing circuit dynamics in  rapidly dividing cells, assuming fixed or time-invariant kinetic rates.   As cells transition from one growth phase to another, kinetic rates can be modeled with time-varying parameters.  We propose a novel class of parameter varying nonlinear models to capture the dynamics of genetic circuits, including the toggle switch, as they transition from different phases of growth. We show that there exists unique solutions for this class of systems.    We show that the domain of these systems, which is the positive orthant, is positively invariant. We showcase a theoretical control strategy for these systems that would grant asymptotic monostability of a desired fixed point. We then take the general form of these systems and analyze their stability properties through the framework of time-varying Koopman operator theory. A necessary condition for asymptotic stability is also provided as well as a sufficient condition for instability. Furthermore, we use real data from a genetic toggle switch which contains a hybrid promoter to validate the models using an algorithm which constructs time varying parameters to model the toggle switch's behavior.

By posing a Bayesian inverse problem to calibrate the discrepancy, we compute a posterior discrepancy distribution and then propagate it through post-optimality sensitivities to compute a posterior distribution on the optimal solution.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75487' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(401)' class='star'><span class='star401'>&star;</span></a> Tucker Hartland  <span id='bitlink-2600'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2600)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2600' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2600)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Exploiting Hierarchical Low-Rank Structure in Ice Sheet Inverse Problems</b><br />Tucker Hartland<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-89.html'>Advanced Computational Methods for Ice-Sheet Modeling and Analysis - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we discuss the problem of estimating solutions of large-scale inverse problems governed by partial differential equation (PDE) based models and the associated uncertainties. The ice flow is modeled as a  three-dimensional, viscous, incompressible fluid via the nonlinear  (first-order) Stokes equations. Solving inverse problems with expensive forward models and high-dimensional parameters is computationally challenging. Here, we exploit the local sensitivity of model predictions to parameters which suggests that the Hessian has off-diagonal low-rank structure, and so therefore build hierarchical matrix Hessian approximations. We demonstrate that for problems with sufficiently-informative data, hierarchical matrices provide for a more computationally efficient approximation format than the related global low-rank format.   This motivates the use of hierarchical matrices for continental-scale problems. Presented computational results are generated using PyAlbany,  a Python interface to the C++ multiphysics library Albany.    
Time permitting, we outline a framework that utilizes Hessian impulse responses of the Hessian and a physically motivated impulse response  interpolation scheme, to further reduce the computational cost of  generating hierarhical matrix Hessian approximations. Said framework is employed to generate inexact Newton-CG preconditioners, which ultimately reduce the number of PDE solves needed to estimate the  inverse problem solution.

The primary reason for this is that the clipping operation (i.e., projection onto an $l_2$ ball of a fixed radius called the clipping threshold) for bounding the sensitivity of the average update to each client's update introduces bias depending on the clipping threshold and the number of local steps in FL, and analyzing this is not easy. For Lipschitz functions, the Lipschitz constant serves as a trivial clipping threshold with zero bias. However, Lipschitzness does not hold in many practical settings; moreover, verifying it and computing the Lipschitz constant is hard. Thus, the choice of the clipping threshold is non-trivial and requires a lot of tuning in practice.  In this work, we provide the first convergence result for private FL with clipping on smooth convex objectives for a general clipping threshold-- without assuming Lipschitzness. We also look at a simpler alternative to clipping (for bounding sensitivity) which is normalization -- where we use only a scaled version of the unit vector along the client updates, completely discarding the magnitude information. The resulting normalization-based private FL algorithm is theoretically shown to have better convergence than its clipping-based counterpart on smooth convex functions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75773' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1916)' class='star'><span class='star1916'>&star;</span></a> Leila Hashemi  <span id='bitlink-2603'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2603)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2603' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2603)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Pore-Scale Simulation of Hydrogen Transport in Porous Media</b><br />Leila Hashemi<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(886)' class='star'><span class='star886'>&star;</span></a> Pedram Hassanzadeh  <span id='bitlink-2604'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2604)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2604' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2604)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Long-Time Stability of Deep Learning-Based Forecast Models of Multi-Scale Chaos</b><br />Pedram Hassanzadeh<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-194.html'>Deep Learning for Sequence Modeling - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>There is growing interest in fully data-driven forecast models (aka digital twins) for multi-scale nonlinear dynamical systems such as Earth’s climate and turbulence. Recent studies have shown the promise of deep neural networks (DNNs) for this purpose, producing models (learned from data) with short-term forecast skills comparable to those of high-fidelity numerical solvers. However, these models are all long-time unstable, failing to reproduce the statistics of the system. The roots of these instabilities are not understood. Here, using observational weather data and simulation data of turbulent flows, we show that the root of the instability is “spectral bias”: the well-known inability of DNNs in learning small scales. We demonstrate how the DNNs’ fundamental inability to represent small scales instigates instability, which then propagates to the large scales. We further show that training a DNN using a Fourier spectral loss function that promotes the learning of small scales combined with a time-integration scheme that dampens error propagation leads to a long-time stable DNN for both testcases. The framework developed here is readily applicable to stabilizing digital twins of any other multi-scale chaotic or turbulent system. Such long-time stable digital twins have wide applications in science and engineering.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75500' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1606)' class='star'><span class='star1606'>&star;</span></a> Johannes Haubner  <span id='bitlink-2605'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2605)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2605' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2605)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Novel Density Based Approach for Topology Optimization</b><br />Johannes Haubner<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-355.html'>New Developments in Shape, Topology and Tubular Optimization - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>A new method for performing density based topology optimization is presented.

We compare the novel approach to state-of-the-art density based and phase field approaches, and approaches based on the topological derivative.  Moreover, we give a theoretically founded choice of the relaxed problems. The density is modeled on a space that allows for jumps along hypersurfaces, such as BV or fractional order Sobolev spaces. Degrees of freedoms in modeling the optimization problem are chosen based on theoretical considerations, i.e., by discussing the arising optimization problems concerning existence, differentiability and convergence towards solutions of the unrelaxed problem.

We begin by using CFD and CAA to compute the acoustic signatures created by rotorblades under on a range of iced blade geometries. Simultaneously, we extract aerodynamic performance coefficients, including lift, drag, and moment, of the respective icing geometries from the flow solutions. Using this dataset, we train a BNN to create a mapping from the iced rotor acoustic signatures to predict the corresponding performance coefficients with quantified epistemic uncertainty in the neural network weights. The creation of BNN involves solving a very high dimensional inference problem on all the network parameters. We tackle this challenge by employing the projected Stein variational gradient descent that identifies and leverages the low dimensional innate structures embedded in the highly temporally correlated acoustic signatures. We show these BNNs to accurately predict rotorblade performance coefficients together with uncertainty in the prediction, which is tremendously valuable to safety-critical pilot decision-making. Furthermore, these BNN models only need be trained offline, and can achieve extremely fast online predictions, making them suitable for real-time, in-flight use.

The deformation of the domain typically leads to nonlinearities within the system, even when the bulk equations are linear, which can give rise to complex bifurcation structures that connect multiple solution branches.    
Another aspect of such systems is that fine-scale features of the solutions are often localised in space and time, meaning that mesh adaptivity is advantageous for efficient numerical solution. Traditional continuation methods designed to follow solution branches are generally formulated from discrete, rather than continuous, systems, which presents problems if the discretisation is not fixed over the parameter range of interest.    
In this talk, I will explain the generic implementation of spatially adaptive continuation methods within the software library oomph-lib (https://www.oomph-lib.org) and how these methods can be used to explore the complex solution structures that arise when solving nonlinear PDEs in deforming domains.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75445' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(404)' class='star'><span class='star404'>&star;</span></a> Huan He  <span id='bitlink-2609'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2609)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2609' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2609)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Nonlinear Acceleration Method That Exploits Symmetry of Hessian</b><br />Huan He<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-90.html'>Acceleration Methods for Scientific and Machine Learning Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Nonlinear acceleration methods are powerful techniques to speed up fixed-point iterations.

We  show that,   with the help of global  strategies like residual check techniques, nlTGCR can converge globally for general nonlinear problems and that under mild conditions, nlTGCR is able to achieve superlinear  convergence.  We further analyze the convergence of nlTGCR in a stochastic setting.

We focus on fixed-point methods that converge asymptotically linearly and that solve an underlying fully smooth and non-convex optimization problem. It is often observed that AA and NGMRES substantially improve the asymptotic convergence behavior of the fixed-point iteration, but this improvement has not been quantified theoretically. We investigate this problem under simplified conditions. We consider stationary versions of AA and NGMRES, and determine coefficients that result in optimal asymptotic convergence factors, given knowledge of the spectrum of the fixed-point operator at the fixed point. This allows us to understand and quantify the asymptotic convergence improvement that can be provided by nonlinear convergence acceleration. Our results are illustrated numerically for a class of test problems from canonical tensor decomposition, comparing steepest descent and alternating least squares (ALS) as the fixed-point iterations that are accelerated by AA and NGMRES. Our numerical tests show that both approaches allow us to estimate asymptotic convergence speed for nonstationary AA and NGMRES with finite window size. We also apply Anderson acceleration to improve the asymptotic linear convergence speed of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) when ADMM by itself converges linearly.  Numerical results also indicate that the optimal linear convergence factor of the stationary AA methods gives a useful estimate for the asymptotic linear convergence speed of the non-stationary AA method that is used in practice.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75360' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(714)' class='star'><span class='star714'>&star;</span></a> Michael Hecht  <span id='bitlink-2612'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2612)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2612' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2612)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multivariate Interpolation in Non-Tensorial Nodes May Lift the Curse of Dimensionality for Trefethen Functions</b><br />Michael Hecht<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-157.html'>Perspectives in Modern Kernel Approximation Methods - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>We extend 1D Newton and Lagrange interpolation to arbitrary dimensions while maintaining their numerical stability and computational efficiency.   Our generalisation relies on a proper choice of non-tensorial unisolvent interpolation nodes, whose number scales sub-exponentially with the space dimension.  While we have proven the resulting interpolation scheme to approximate all continuous Sobolev functions, in addition, empirical demonstrations show that we  reach the optimal exponential approximation rate for the Runge function. This  suggest our interpolation method to be  optimal  for a class of analytic functions we term Trefethen functions. Combining sub-exponential node counts with exponential approximation rates, we may lift the curse of dimensionality for interpolation problems involving Trefethen functions.    
We have condensed our findings into implementations that are included in the open source Python package minterpy. We further sketch how minterpy might impact computational challenges, such as: solving (inverse) PDE problems by variational spectral methods, delivering novel solutions for computational tasks in numerical differential geometry, and realising efficient and stable regression for strongly-varying multivariate functions given on equispaced or arbitrary, scattered data.

Linearization based approaches can cope well with the computational bottlenecks but, by design, are limited to regimes where the nonlinearities do not dominate.  The idea of considering state dependent coefficients, i.e. factorizing nonlinear terms $f(x(t))$ as $f(x(t))=A(x(t))\,x(t)$, where $x$ is the system's state and where $A$ is a matrix valued function of the state, seems capable to address control tasks in a nonlinear fashion while keeping a linear structure that is important for exploiting the many relevant tools from linear theory and numerical linear algebra.  Still, the resulting formulation can be too complex for large-scale systems. Therefore, we propose an approximation by an affine-linear parametrization   \begin{equation}  f(x(t)) = A(x(t))\,x(t) \approx \sum_{i=1}^r \rho_i(x(t)) A_i \, x(t)  \end{equation}  with an encoding $\rho(x(t)) \in \mathbb R^r$ and $r$ being much smaller than the actual state dimension and with constant matrices $A_i$, $i=1,\dotsc,r$.  In this talk we present a study how convolutional autoencoders can provide such parametrizations of very low dimensions and compare to more standard approaches like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Furthermore, we show how the low-dimensional parametrization is applied for nonlinear controller design for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and discuss the interplay of approximation quality and controller performance.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75572' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1539)' class='star'><span class='star1539'>&star;</span></a> Fabian Heimann  <span id='bitlink-2615'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2615)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2615' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2615)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Unfitted Space-Time Finite Element Methods for Coupled Surface-Bulk Problems</b><br />Fabian Heimann<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-339.html'>High Performance Computing Tools for Mixed Dimensional Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Coupled surface-bulk problems represent an important range of application for numerical simulation techniques in computational sciences, as they model a variety of processes in fluid dynamics and biology. In this talk, we focus in particular on a model of soluble surfactants involving convection and diffusion. To solve this model problem, we consider unfitted space-time finite element simulations, which come with the benefit of a flexible handling of complex geometries. The overall coupled problem can be decomposed into several components, which can be studied individually first and finally taken together, such as the mere surface and the mere bulk problem. In relation to the important reference work "A cut finite element method for coupled bulk-surface problems on time-depent domains", P. Hansbo, M.G. Larson, S. Zahedi (CMAME 307, 96-116) we present some variant methods for several of these steps. Specifically, we investigate a stabilisation variant which we call direct Ghost penalty stabilisation. Moreover, we study the applicability of the higher order geometry description developed for the merely spatial case in "High order unfitted finite element methods on level set domains using isoparametric mappings", C. Lehrenfeld (CMAME 300, 716-733).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75748' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(785)' class='star'><span class='star785'>&star;</span></a> Matthias Heinkenschloss  <span id='bitlink-2616'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2616)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2616' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2616)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Certified Optimization with Reduced Order Models</b><br />Matthias Heinkenschloss<br />Friday, March 3 10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-171.html'>The Interplay of MOR and Optimization in Modern Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>This talk presents new approaches for the optimization of expensive large-scale optimization problems using reduced order models (ROMs).

New trust-region and line search based optimization approaches and their integration with efficient ROM contructions are presented that are implementable when only asymptotic ROM error bounds are available and have proven convergence properties.

The key idea of PINNs is to incorporate the residual of the PDE as well as boundary conditions into the loss function of the neural network. This provides a simple and mesh-free approach for solving problems relating to PDEs. However, a key limitation of PINNs is their lack of accuracy and efficiency when solving problems with larger domains and more complex, multi-scale solutions.    
In a more recent approach, Finite Basis Physics-Informed Neural Networks  (FBPINNs), the authors use ideas from domain decomposition to accelerate the learning process of PINNs and improve their accuracy in this setting. In this talk, we show how Schwarz-like additive, multiplicative, and hybrid iteration methods for training FBPINNs can be developed. Furthermore, we will present numerical experiments on the influence on convergence and accuracy of these different variants.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75727' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(572)' class='star'><span class='star572'>&star;</span></a> Tapio Helin  <span id='bitlink-2618'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2618)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2618' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2618)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Approximative Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design in Inverse Problems</b><br />Tapio Helin<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-126.html'>Model-Based Optimal Experimental Design - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>We study the stability properties of the expected utility function in Bayesian optimal experimental design.

That problem is part of our compilation pipeline for transforming any computable real function presented by a PODE, into an elementary Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) which computes that function on a distinguished output species.    
In this talk, we are interested in a notion of online robust analog computation using stabilizing CRN/PODE, i.e. systems for which the input/output relation is solely defined by the set of stable fixed points.  This leads us to study a variant of the quadratization problem which preserves the set of stable states of the original system instead of the complete trajectories. While this problem may seem simpler than the previous one, we show its NP-hardness in the non-succinct representation with a reduction of the cover vertex set problem as previously.

Saddle point finding methods can be classified into two categories.  First, there are methods including the nudged elastic band and string methods which require knowledge of both reactant and product states to determine a minimum energy path connecting them.  These so-called double-ended methods are widely used with density functional theory to determine rates of anticipated reaction mechanisms.  A second class of single-ended methods, generally based upon minimum-mode following techniques, require only the initial state to determine possible reaction mechanisms leading to possibly unknown product states.  These single-ended methods require more sampling but they have the power to map out reactions on a potential surface with minimal user bias.  I will discuss application of these saddle point finding methods to accelerating molecular dynamics simulations, such as through the hyperdynamics approach.  Also, upon discovering a set of reaction mechanisms from an initial state, minimum mode following saddle searches can be coupled to kinetic Monte Carlo to model the evolution of atomic scale systems over the time scales of the reactions.  This adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo method can, in favorable cases, even model the evolution of atomic scale systems to experimental time scales of seconds or minutes -- orders of magnitude longer time scales than can be reached with molecular dynamics.  A frank assessment of the limitations of the methods will also be given.  Examples will include molecular reactions on metal surfaces and surface segregation in bimetallic nanoparticles.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75497' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(667)' class='star'><span class='star667'>&star;</span></a> Fernando Henriquez  <span id='bitlink-2624'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2624)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2624' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2624)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Neural Network Approximation in Shape Uncertainty Quantification for Acoustic and Electromagnetic Scattering</b><br />Fernando Henriquez<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-147.html'>Scientific Machine Learning and Data-Driven Techniques in Complex Multi-Physics Systems  - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>We consider the acoustic and electromagnetic scattering problems by random domains and surfaces. Our goal is to construct an efficient approximation of the corresponding domain-to-solution map. After considering a domain or surface parametrization depending on countably many parameters, one obtains a high-dimensional parametric map describing the problem's solution manifold. To tackle the efficient approximation of these maps, we adopt the approach proposed by Hesthaven and Ubbiali (Journal of Computational Physics 363 (2018): 55-78.). Firstly, by using a collection of so-called high-fidelity solutions or snapshots, a reduced basis is constructed to approximate the solution manifold. Then, we use deep feed-forward neural networks to compute the coefficient of the reduced basis solution. This procedure renders the evaluation of the approximate parameter-to-solution in the online phase independent of the offline part.   Provided that the parameter-to-solution map satisfies certain smoothness properties, which have been verified for a range of models used in acoustic and electromagnetic scattering,   we show that one can use quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature rules in the computation of the snapshots used in the reduced basis and also in the training of the involved deep neural networks. Finally, we provide numerical results for different models arising in acoustic and electromagnetic scattering.

In this work, we propose a meshfree discretization scheme based on a collocation approach, which takes a significantly smaller number of neighborhood nodes as compared to the classical particle-based scheme, in order to achieve a certain accuracy while maintaining the same length scale. Our proposed discretization procedure is employed within the regions of the computational domain, where the field variable can be approximated by smooth basis functions inside the neighborhood. In the hybrid approach, our method is then combined with the classical scheme, the latter being applied within the regions subject to discontinuities and material damage. We illustrate the increase in efficiency of our proposed discretization scheme due to the reduced number of neighborhood nodes and evaluate the convergence behavior. As numerical examples of the hybrid approach, we adopt the brittle fracture problem by means of bond-based peridynamics as well as the peridynamic corrosion model in two and three dimensions, respectively.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75730' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(617)' class='star'><span class='star617'>&star;</span></a> Jan Hermann  <span id='bitlink-2626'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2626)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2626' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2626)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Solving the Electronic Schr&#246;dinger Equation with Deep Learning</b><br />Jan Hermann<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-135.html'>Perspectives on Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>The electronic Schrödinger equation is a second-order partial differential equation for the wave function in $3N$ dimensions that underlies all quantum chemistry.

It integrates three ingredients: exact physics as constraints, approximate physics as baselines, and neural networks as universal approximators.

In comparison to polynomial approximations, rational functions can converge at exponential rates (root-exponential to be precise) even for functions with singularities. In this talk we focus on branch point singularities, which may arise in applications as singularities at corners or edges of a computational domain. We show that poles in a typical rational approximation for such functions cluster towards the singularity, not unlike graded meshes do in adaptive numerical simulation methods. The class of so-called “lightning methods” for boundary value problems, developed by Trefethen and collaborators, explicitly uses rational approximations and exploits this property by choosing clustered poles in advance. This turns the rational approximation problem into a linear one, since rational functions depend non-linearly on the location of the poles but linearly on the associated residues. We show that a judicious choice of the distribution of poles has a significant impact on the rate of convergence. Moreover, the chosen representation of the rational functions, i.e., the basis of the approximation space, strongly affects the numerical stability of these classes of methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75458' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1082)' class='star'><span class='star1082'>&star;</span></a> Felix Herrmann  <span id='bitlink-2630'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2630)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2630' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2630)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Next Step: Interoperable Domain-Specific Programming</b><br />Felix Herrmann<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-238.html'>From Math to Code: Domain-Specific Programming Abstractions, Languages, and Frameworks - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Even though domain-specific programming approaches allow for readable, scalable, and maintainable software without sacrificing performance, the new paradigm of learned physics-informed models calls for an interdisciplinary approach typically involving multiple domain-specific languages. Take for example the problem of inverting for the fluid-flow properties from time-lapse seismic data, which entails domain-specific programming on the intersection of wave simulators, matrix-free linear algebra, learned neural surrogates for two-phase flow, and prior and posterior distributions for the fluid-flow properties. While domain-specific solutions exist for each of these sub-disciplines, integrating these approaches – which may involve different programming languages – into a single coupled scalable inversion framework that supports algorithmic differentiation can be a challenge. However, we show that challenges like this can be met when working with proper abstractions. In our inversion example, this involves math-inspired symbolic abstractions for numerical solutions of the wave equation (Devito), matrix-free implementations for its Jacobians (JUDI.jl), abstractions for Automatic Differentiation (ChainRules.jl), and homegrown implementations for conditional Invertible Neural Networks (InvertibleNetworks.jl) and Fourier Neural Operators (ParametricOperators.jl).

Current research uses temperature-induced phase separation to efficiently fabricate polymer gel microparticles of desired shapes and sizes. To better understand this process, we develop several models of microscale phase separation of ternary fluids. A simple surface energy minimisation model describes possible equilibrium microparticle shapes. We then interrogate the dynamics of microparticle manufacture by combining a ternary Cahn-Hilliard model with surface tension- and buoyancy-driven Stokes flow in the Cahn-Hilliard-Stokes-Boussinesq (CHSB) model. By simulating the CHSB model in three dimensions using the efficient Dedalus spectral code, we show that all physical effects - surface tension, fluid flow, and buoyancy - are necessary for microparticles to attain minimal energy crescent configurations. Without fluid flow or buoyancy, microparticles consistently settle on spherical shell equilibria, in contrast to experiments. We then outline how varying surface energies, densities, viscosities, and concentrations can each influence microparticle manufacture, before concluding with a discussion of how fluid stresses drive microparticle evolution.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75538' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1959)' class='star'><span class='star1959'>&star;</span></a> A.

SBP operators are typically defined on a geometrically simple reference domain — for example, a quadrilateral or triangular domain — and then mapped to elements in an unstructured mesh or blocks in a multi-block grid.  Here we consider a more flexible construction of SBP operators that is suitable for degrees of freedom over point clouds.  The construction is a generalization of the discontinuous Galerkin difference (DGD) method.  Unlike DGD, the proposed method does not pair degrees of freedom with elements in a one-to-one manner; instead, the element mesh is used only to perform integration and define the support of the basis functions.  We will present results that verify the method and demonstrate its flexibility; in particular, we will present how $r$-adaption can be applied to the method without modifying the mesh.

In this work we extend LR B-splines to allow for non-uniform polynomial degree. This capability, combined with local h-refinement, also allows for local k-refinement, that is, increasing the polynomial degree as well as the smoothness at newly introduced knot lines. The novel refinement schemes are based on degree elevation of individual basis functions by means of certain two-scale relations, and lead to nested spaces. We study the properties of the introduced spaces and apply them to several two-dimensional model problems, illustrating the efficacy of the proposed adaptive refinement methodology in the context of isogeometric analysis.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75664' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1249)' class='star'><span class='star1249'>&star;</span></a> Andrew J.

This is the case on modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), while it is generally not the case on traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs). In this talk, experiments on both GPUs and CPUs are shown that compare the performance of BGMRES against GMRES as the number of RHS increases. The experiments indicate that there are many cases in which BGMRES is slower than GMRES on CPUs, but faster on GPUs. Furthermore, when varying the number of RHS on the GPU, there is an optimal number of RHS where BGMRES is clearly most advantageous over GMRES. A computational model is developed using hardware specific parameters, showing qualitatively where this optimal number of RHS is, and this model also helps explain the phenomena observed in the experiments.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75620' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(308)' class='star'><span class='star308'>&star;</span></a> Sander Hille  <span id='bitlink-2638'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2638)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2638' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2638)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reverse Engineering of a Long-Distance Hormone Transport Mechanism in Plants by Computational Modeling and Data Analysis</b><br />Sander Hille<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-68.html'>Data-Driven Methods in Computational Biomechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Indole-3-acetic acid (`auxin') is a plant hormone that plays an important role in various developmental processes. Its transport through the plant has been studied for more than a century, but the detailed mechanisms of transport, in particular the long-range transport from top to roots, are still not fully clear.     
In this talk we discuss how mathematical modeling, simulation and experimental research have been integrated to gain insights into these mechanisms in the model plant  Arabidopsis thaliana. The model consists of a coupled system of reaction-diffusion-advection equations. Parameter estimation procedures and physiologically relevant ranges for parameters require simulation of the model in regimes where the Peclet number is neither large nor small, causing numerical complications.     
Moreover, experimental circumstances strongly limit the number of data points (of various types) that can be obtained. A practical parameter identifiability analysis needs to be performed to identify which parameter combinations can still be confidently estimated from the data. We introduce such a method and show that the addition of the measurement of a single well-chosen quantity (and single data point) in the experimental design can drastically influence the collection of identifiable parameter sets. Any of these sets can then be used to draw conclusions on the underlying mechanisms and aid in the 'reverse-engineering' of the long-range auxin transport mechanism.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75313' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2037)' class='star'><span class='star2037'>&star;</span></a> Caroline Hills  <span id='bitlink-2639'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2639)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2639' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2639)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Computing Optimal Designs for the Approximate Synthesis of Four-Bar Mechanisms</b><br />Caroline Hills<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-425.html'>Student Days: Student Chapter Presentations - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Exact synthesis of robotic mechanisms is limited by the number of design positions, which Wampler, Sommese, and Morgan found in 1992 that there are 1,442 distinct coupler curves to exactly trace a maximum of nine design positions.

Such approximate synthesis problems can be described by solving an unconstrained optimization problem where the objective is a polynomial.  Employing homotopy continuation methods allows one to compute all critical points.  This talk will describe the techniques used in computing the total solution set to an approximate synthesis formulation independent of the number of design positions and present an example associated with solving real design solutions.

Together, they force us to revise the way scientists and  non-scientists use computational tools and models, as all stakeholders  must be able to develop trust in these tools and models at their  respective levels of domain knowledge and engagement.    
Today's software engineering techniques, inherited from an industrial  context, focus on small development teams creating computational tools  for a large number of users that interact with the tools at a much more  abstract level. Software developers thus become gatekeepers of the  computational models that are embedded in these tools, which mere users  can neither fully understand nor safely modify. Open Science requires  reducing this epistemic opacity, allowing all stakeholders to interact  with computational models at their level of scientific rather than  technical expertise.    
A strategy that I have been exploring is moving the models out of the  tools and into the human-computer interface in the form of  specifications. The central user interface of such a future scientific  computing environment is an authoring tool for a computational medium  that can represent models. Computational tools operate on this medium,  reading models and parameters from it and adding back their results. I  will conclude my presentation with a demonstration of a prototype  implementation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75726' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1767)' class='star'><span class='star1767'>&star;</span></a> Michael Hinterm&#252;ller  <span id='bitlink-2641'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2641)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2641' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2641)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Descent Algorithm for the Optimal Control of Relu Neural Network Informed PDEs Based on Approximate Directional Derivatives</b><br />Michael Hinterm&#252;ller<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-389.html'>Algorithms for Applications in Nonconvex, Nonsmooth Optimization</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>We introduce a numerical solver for a class of optimal control problems with learning-informed semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs).

Typically, the applications impose strict requirements on the radiation pattern from the array antenna, which require detailed optimisation of the antenna parameters. A major drawback of phased-array antenna design is the array synthesis problem, i.e., determining the phases of the array such that the requirements are satisfied. The synthesis problem poses several major challenges that are tied to, e.g., conflicting objectives of the underlying optimisation, many local optima, and the need to carry out computationally costly online simulations. To address these challenges, this work demonstrates how latent-space modelling by custom-tailored autoencoders can augment and improve state-of-the-art, model-based synthesis of phased arrays. We explore an encoder-decoder structure that combines highly accurate simulation-based synthetic data with application-tailored models that are embedded into the network architectures, thereby guiding the latent space to reflect the real-world antenna problem, allowing low-rank subspaces to be extracted from the data.

To overcome this issue, we introduce local time-stepping (LTS) schemes  which rely on the leapfrog scheme on the coarse part of the mesh.  On the fine part we employ two variants:  a stabilized leapfrog-Chebyshev scheme leading to an explicit LTS scheme and  $\theta$-schemes resulting in (locally) implicit LTS schemes.  For the space discretization we focus on a  symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin discretization.    
After the construction of these schemes we show  that their CFL condition only depends on the coarse part of the mesh and  that they converge with second order in time.  Moreover, we present some numerical examples confirming our theoretical results.

The key feature is the introduction of an additional local volume constraint (LVC), which allows to adjust the desired spatial scales. The main novelty is that the radius of the LVC may depend both on space and a local stress measure. This allows for creating optimal topologies with heterogeneous mesostructures enforcing any desired spatial grading and accommodating stress concentrations by stress dependent pore size. I will present some analytical results for the resulting optimal control problem and conclude with numerical simulations showing the  versatility of our approach for creating optimal macroscopic designs with tailored mesostructures.

We develop the variational analysis of this scalar equation. The approach is based on a study of the variational-analytic properties of general convex optimization problems that are (partial) infimal projections of the the sum of the function in question and the perspective map of a convex kernel. When the kernel is the Euclidean norm squared, the solution map corresponds to the proximal map, and thus the variational properties derived for the general case apply to the proximal case. Properties of the value function and the corresponding solution map —including local Lipschitz continuity, directional differentiability, and semismoothness— are derived. An SC1 optimization framework for computing epigraphical and level-set projections is thus established. Numerical experiments on 1-norm projection illustrate the effectiveness of the approach as compared with specialized algorithms.

The local radial basis function computational method (LRBFCM) is an extension to solve large scale problems which has hindered the practical application of the global RBF method for years due to the ill-conditioning of its resultant full coefficient matrix. The LRBFCM has recently been applied to solve 2D cavity flows problems with free surface and some nonlocal diffusion and phase field problems.  The main idea of the integration-based radial basis function (FIM-RBF) method is to transform the original partial differential equation into an equivalent integral equation whose approximation can be sought by standard numerical integration techniques.  Due to the advantages of unconditional stability of numerical integration and spectral convergence of RBF approximation, the FIM-RBF method can solve boundary value problem under irregular domain with various kinds of stiffness. Recently, the FIM method has been generalized to solve multi-dimensional options pricing problems.  Numerical examples with sensitivity analysis will be given to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of these meshless computational methods.       </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75599' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1202)' class='star'><span class='star1202'>&star;</span></a> Yankun Hong  <span id='bitlink-2657'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2657)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2657' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2657)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Physics-Informed Two-Tier Neural Network for Non-Linear Model Order Reduction</b><br />Yankun Hong<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-264.html'>Bridging Numerical Analysis and Machine Learning - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>In recent years, machine learning (ML) has had a great impact in the area of non-intrusive, non-linear model order reduction (MOR). However, the offline training phase still suffers from high computational costs since it requires numerous expensive full-order solutions as the training data. Furthermore, in state-of-the-art methods, neural networks trained by a small amount of the training data cannot be expected to generalize well enough, and the training phase generally ignores the underlying physical information. Moreover, state-of-the-art affine decomposition and hyper reduction techniques are intrusive or entail huge offline computational costs. To resolve these challenges, inspired by recent developments in physics-informed neural networks and the physics-reinforced neural networks, we propose a non-intrusive, physics-informed, two-tier deep network (TTDN) method. The proposed network, wherein the first tier achieves the regression of the unknown quantity of interest (QoI) and the second tier rebuilds the physical constitutive law between the unknown QoI's and derived quantities, is trained using pretraining and semi-supervised learning strategies. To showcase the efficiency of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods, we perform numerical experiments on challenging non-linear and non-affine problems and study the behavior associated with the high or relatively low computational cost of the full-order data.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75604' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1698)' class='star'><span class='star1698'>&star;</span></a> Alexander P.

Using a combination of particle image velocimetry data, optical scans, and confocal microscopy, we will discuss the creation of fluid-structure interaction models for organismal pumping and fluid transport, with the goal of developing an intuition on the physical mechanisms that drive their success. Using a combination of simplified geometries and scanned body meshes, we will employ the immersed boundary/finite element (IB/FE) method to simulate chambered, valveless pumping mechanism generated by the pelagic tunicate known as a larvacean. Additionally, we will use the same modeling methodology to explore the metachronal motion and fluid transport of the parapodial paddles of the pelagic, midwater polychaete known as tomopterids. All motion described in these systems will not be prescribed and will emerge from the interaction of active muscular tension, passive elastic recoil, and the local fluid environment.

This requires vast amounts of computing power, so highly scalable algorithms are essential on massively parallel modern hardware. The ParaDiag method achieves this by exposing time parallelism, in addition to the spatial parallelism exposed by traditional domain decomposition.    
We present recent progress on the application of ParaDiag to finite element discretisations of PDEs for atmospheric flow, which are particularly challenging for time-parallel methods due to their hyperbolic nature. These solvers are implemented as an open source general library using Firedrake, an automated code generation framework for the solution of finite element methods.    
Various ParaDiag formulations are explored, including quasi-Newton iterations and the preconditioned Newton-Krylov method, and their parallel scaling is compared. The performance of ParaDiag is compared against theoretical convergence estimates. We describe our approaches to the solution of the block systems within the ParaDiag matrix and show how these can be realised within the library.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75575' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1900)' class='star'><span class='star1900'>&star;</span></a> Fabian Hoppe  <span id='bitlink-2660'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2660)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2660' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2660)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Parallel Zolotarev-SVD for the Analysis of Rocket Combustion Data</b><br />Fabian Hoppe<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1973)' class='star'><span class='star1973'>&star;</span></a> Andrew Horning  <span id='bitlink-2661'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2661)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2661' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2661)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>SIAM Activity Group on Computational Science and Engineering Best Paper Prize</b><br />Andrew Horning<br />Monday, February 27 4:30 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76580' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1331)' class='star'><span class='star1331'>&star;</span></a> Tamas Horvath  <span id='bitlink-2662'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2662)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2662' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2662)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Space-Time Embedded/hybridized DG for the Navier-Stokes Problem</b><br />Tamas Horvath<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-293.html'>Robust Finite Element Methods for Convection-Diffusion Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Partial differential equations posed on moving domains arise in many applications such as air turbine modeling, flow past airplane wings, etc. The time-dependent nature of the flow domain poses an additional challenge when devising numerical methods for the discretization of such problems. One alternative when dealing with time-dependent domains is to pose the problem on a space-time domain and apply, for example, a finite element method in both space and time. These space-time methods can easily handle the time-dependent nature of the domain. In this talk, we present a space-time hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on moving domains. This discretization is pointwise mass conserving and pressure robust, even on time-dependent domains. Moreover, high order can be achieved both in space and time.

This solution uses the in-house code Fluid-Solver that runs efficiently on CPU and GPU nodes. The algorithm is based on a flux-vector splitting finite volume scheme over unstructured tetrahedral meshes and solves the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in the second order. For model order reduction we applied the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with the snapshot matrix generated by runs for velocity inlet boundary conditions of which wind directions samples the wind rose.

Results are visualized in real-time by viewing images of dedicated slices at sampled time points and also in an interactive way. Some remarkable numerical properties of the reduced model simulations will be discussed as well, namely the greatly increased stability of the POD-simulations: explicit time-steppings are stable for CFL=1000 for the POD-reduced model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75888' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(358)' class='star'><span class='star358'>&star;</span></a> Remy Hosseinkhan Boucher  <span id='bitlink-2664'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2664)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2664' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2664)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Exploration Strategies for Control of Chaotic Dynamical Systems Using Reinforcement Learning</b><br />Remy Hosseinkhan Boucher<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-79.html'>Advances in Deep Neural Operators - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>Predicting and controlling the future state of a complex physical system is a cornerstone in a wide range of situations. This aim however often remains difficult to achieve. In particular, for a high-dimensional multiscale nonlinear system, a model is not necessarily available or usable due to real-time control constraints which drastically limit the affordable computational complexity. Data-driven control circumvents the need for an a priori model and constitutes an attractive approach.    
In this talk, we will focus on a Reinforcement Learning strategy fully leveraging its theoretical foundation in optimal control theory while accounting for challenges of practical situations such as weak observability. We identify the multiple factors and their influence on the policy identification without relying on physics constraints or prior knowledge. In particular, we develop consistent exploration strategies allowing to carefully sample new observations in order to improve knowledge of the system. As a result, better control policies could be obtained with fewer interactions with the system, resulting in a faster learning. To achieve this, we rely on tools from information theory and optimal design of experiments to quantify the knowledge gathers during the process.  Our framework will be illustrated on simplified models of turbulent flows such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75334' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2075)' class='star'><span class='star2075'>&star;</span></a> Alexandra Hotti  <span id='bitlink-2665'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2665)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2665' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2665)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The benefits of mixtures in black-box variational inference and a step towards their convergence guarantees</b><br />Alexandra Hotti<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-370.html'>Variational Inference: From Theory to Practice - Part II of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Gaussian mixture distributions can be used as variational posteriors to obtain a more flexible variational approximation. We show how the mixture components cooperate when they jointly adapt to maximize the ELBO.  We build upon recent advances in the multiple and adaptive importance sampling literature. We then model the mixture components using separate encoder networks and show empirically that the ELBO is monotonically non-decreasing as a function of the number of mixture components. These results hold for a range of different VAE architectures on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. On these datasets, we show that mixtures can achieve better test set log-likelihood values compare to other state-of-the-art methods for obtaining a more flexible variational posterior, namely normalizing flows, hierarchical models and the VampPrior.    
These results empirically show that GMMs can perform well. However, to be certain that GMMs always work, we would need convergence guarantees. Convergence guarantees commonly utilize convexity or smoothness. However, the ELBO with a GMM  variational posterior is not, in general, convex. Also, we show that the GMM entropy term in the corresponding ELBO objective is, in general, not Lipschitz smooth, making the ELBO non-smooth. However, we investigate under which assumptions the ELBO is smooth. First, by leveraging previous smoothness results, we prove that the energy term in the ELBO is smooth for a uniformly-weighted mixture of location-scale family distributions. Then, by lower bounding the variance parameters, as is common in VI in practice, we then show that the corresponding ELBO objective is Lipschitz smooth for a uniformly weighted GMM.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75808' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1773)' class='star'><span class='star1773'>&star;</span></a> Anastasiia Hraivoronska  <span id='bitlink-2666'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2666)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2666' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2666)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Variational Approach to Discrete-to-Continuum Convergence of Evolutionary Equations with Gradient Structure</b><br />Anastasiia Hraivoronska<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-390.html'>Variational Models for Machine Learning</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75864' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1720)' class='star'><span class='star1720'>&star;</span></a> Chih-Chi Hu  <span id='bitlink-2667'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2667)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2667' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2667)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) Using the Particle Flow Filter (PFF) in a High-Dimensional Atmospheric Model in the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART)</b><br />Chih-Chi Hu<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-380.html'>High-Fidelity and Data-Driven Methods for Multiscale and Multi-Physics Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Representing the true state of the atmosphere is a very difficult task.   In the modern weather forecasting, satellite based observations are assimilated into the numerical model in order to obtain a more realistic representation of the atmosphere in the model. This process is called “data assimilation (DA)”.     
DA plays an important role in constraining the model heavily with observations. However, due to the high dimension of the atmospheric model, many DA methods are developed based on either Gaussian or linear assumptions, which are not applicable for some types of observations. Recently, a more general DA method, the Particle Flow Filter (PFF), is proposed to deal with the nonlinear observations and has been shown to work effectively in high dimensional models. With some modifications of the algorithm, the PFF can be adapted to run efficiently in the Data Assimilation Research Testbed  (DART) framework and is now able to run in parallel.    
We will demonstrate an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) using an atmospheric model which has nonlinear interactions between dynamics and  thermodynamics. Specifically, the performance of the DA using the PFF will be compared with using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF), which is a widely used DA scheme based on linear and Gaussian assumptions. Discussions will be focused on how the PFF and the EAKF deal with the nonlinear observations differently, and how these differences can affect the model behavior.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75834' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1972)' class='star'><span class='star1972'>&star;</span></a> Kaibo Hu  <span id='bitlink-2668'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2668)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2668' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2668)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>SIAM Activity Group on Computational Science and Engineering Early Career Prize - Structure-Preserving Discretization of Incompressible MHD Systems</b><br />Kaibo Hu<br />Monday, February 27 5:00 PM&ndash;5:25 PM<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76579' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(833)' class='star'><span class='star833'>&star;</span></a> Xun Huan  <span id='bitlink-2669'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2669)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2669' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2669)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reinforcement Learning Framework for Bayesian Sequential Optimal Experimental Design</b><br />Xun Huan<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-182.html'>Optimal Experimental Design</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Experiments are indispensable for learning and developing models in engineering and science. When experiments are expensive, a careful design of these limited data-acquisition opportunities can be immensely beneficial. Optimal experimental design, while leveraging the predictive capabilities of a simulation model, provides a rigorous framework to systematically quantify and maximize the value of experiments. We focus on designing a finite sequence of experiments, seeking fully optimal design policies (strategies) that can (a) adapt to newly collected data during the sequence (i.e. feedback) and (b) anticipate future changes (i.e. lookahead). We cast this sequential decision-making problem in a Bayesian setting with information-based utilities, and solve it numerically via policy gradient methods from reinforcement learning. In particular, we directly parameterize the policies and value functions by neural networks—thus adopting an actor-critic approach—and improve them using gradient estimates produced from simulated design and observation sequences. The overall method is demonstrated on an algebraic benchmark and a sensor movement application for source inversion. The results provide intuitive insights on the benefits of feedback and lookahead, and indicate substantial computational advantages compared to previous numerical approaches based on approximate dynamical programming.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75481' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(306)' class='star'><span class='star306'>&star;</span></a> Cheng Huang  <span id='bitlink-2670'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2670)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2670' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2670)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Enabling Predictive Reduced-Order Models for Turbulent Reacting Flows Using Adaptive Model Order Reduction</b><br />Cheng Huang<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-67.html'>Nonlinear Approximations of Latent Dynamics for Model Reduction and Beyond - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Even with exascale computing capabilities, high-fidelity, full-scale simulations of turbulent combustion in realistic applications like rocket combustion remain computationally expensive and inaccessible for many-query applications. Projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) methods have shown promise in greatly improving computational efficiency. However, classical MOR methods that seek reduced solutions in low-dimensional subspaces fail for realistic turbulent combustion problems because reacting flows feature extreme stiffness, sharp gradients, and multi-scale transport, which pose great challenges in deriving effective low-order representations and developing predictive reduced-order models (ROMs). In this talk, we introduce an adaptive reduced-order modeling technique which updates the low-dimensional space, thus circumventing representation barriers faced by static reduced-dimensional spaces. The method leverages model-form preserving least-squares projections with variable transformation (MP-LSVT) for improved robustness of ROM and adapts the low-dimensional subspaces based on the evaluated dynamics during online calculations to enable predictive ROMs for turbulent reacting flows.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75310' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1776)' class='star'><span class='star1776'>&star;</span></a> Chengyang Huang  <span id='bitlink-2671'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2671)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2671' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2671)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Variantioanl System Identification of Fokker-Planck Equation</b><br />Chengyang Huang<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-390.html'>Variational Models for Machine Learning</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is an inverse problem of Reinforcement Learning (RL) that uncovers the reward function of a Markov decision process from observed trajectories of an agent. It is an appealing way to quantify the rationale behind the behavior of humans or any living agents. Like other inverse problems, IRL is ill-posed and becomes especially challenging when the transition model is unknown or inaccessible for sampling because the evolution of states and actions depends both on the transition model and the agent's policy, which is derived from the transition model as well together with the reward function. Current IRL approaches either assume the transition model is accessible or utilize data-driven methods to estimate the transition model beforehand without considering physics. We propose a novel physics-aware IRL algorithm that can simultaneously infer the reward function and transition probability function. We first build a connection between the value function in RL and the potential function in the Fokker-Planck equation and then employ a variational system identification method to infer the potential function. The reward function and transition probability function can then be evaluated instantaneously with the built connection. We demonstrate our new approach using a Gridworld benchmark problem and a biological problem of cancer cells.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75864' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1755)' class='star'><span class='star1755'>&star;</span></a> Jinzi Mac Huang  <span id='bitlink-2672'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2672)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2672' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2672)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Morphological Attractors in Natural Convective Dissolution</b><br />Jinzi Mac Huang<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-386.html'>Flow-Induced Geophysical Shaping Processes - Part I of I</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>Ever-changing geological features on this planet never fail to capture our imagination and inspire new scientific advances. Among them, the formation of stone forests is one striking geomorphology caused by dissolution and fluid-structure interactions in nature. Recent experiments demonstrate how a soluble body placed in a fluid spontaneously forms a dissolution pinnacle — a slender, upward pointing shape that resembles naturally occurring karst pinnacles found in stone forests. This unique shape results from the interplay between interface motion and the natural convective flows driven by the descent of relatively heavy solute. In this talk, we will discuss a class of exact solutions that act as attractors for the shape dynamics in two and three dimensions. Intriguingly, the solutions exhibit large but finite tip curvature without any regularization, and they agree remarkably well with experimental measurements. The relationship between the dimensions of the initial shape and the final state of dissolution may offer a principle for estimating the age and environmental conditions of geological structures.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75857' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2021)' class='star'><span class='star2021'>&star;</span></a> Jan Hueckelheim  <span id='bitlink-2673'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2673)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2673' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2673)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Integrating Scientific Simulations with Machine Learning Algorithms</b><br />Jan Hueckelheim<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-421.html'>Integrating Scientific Simulations with Machine Learning Algorithms - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77172' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2024)' class='star'><span class='star2024'>&star;</span></a> Jan Hueckelheim  <span id='bitlink-2674'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2674)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2674' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2674)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Integrating Scientific Simulations with Machine Learning Algorithms</b><br />Jan Hueckelheim<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-422.html'>Integrating Scientific Simulations with Machine Learning Algorithms - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77173' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(628)' class='star'><span class='star628'>&star;</span></a> Mario Huemer  <span id='bitlink-2675'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2675)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2675' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2675)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Unfolding for Data Estimation in Wireless Communication Systems</b><br />Mario Huemer<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-138.html'>EU-MATHS-IN: Success Stories of Mathematical Technologies in Societal Challenges and Industry, Part I</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Traditionally, data estimation on the receiver side of a wireless digital communication system is accomplished with model-based methods. These methods are based on well-established physical and statistical models. Consequently, they are well-interpretable and performance bounds can often be derived. However, modeling errors, oversimplifications, wrong statistical assumptions, or insufficient model knowledge may severely degrade the performance of model-based approaches, and incorporating empirical statistics of possibly available data is usually difficult. Data-driven approaches can resolve some of the aforementioned issues. However, they usually suffer from huge data hunger, and they typically lack interpretability. Some of these problems may be tackled by incorporating model knowledge into data-driven methods, which is a major challenge with lots of open research questions.    
In this talk, we will present model-inspired neural networks (NNs) for data estimation, which are derived by using deep unfolding. These NNs are designed by unfolding the iterations of iterative model-based algorithms to layers of NNs. We will highlight similarities between model-based methods and model-inspired NNs. For example, we will show that conducting preconditioning, which is known to improve iterative model-based methods, can boost the performance of NNs that are derived by deep unfolding. We will compare these NNs to traditional model-based methods, and highlight their pros and cons.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75427' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(175)' class='star'><span class='star175'>&star;</span></a> Hennie Husniah  <span id='bitlink-2676'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2676)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2676' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2676)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Condition-Based Maintenance Lease Contract with Continuously Monitored Equipment</b><br />Hennie Husniah<br />Tuesday, February 28 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-38.html'>Recent Advances in Stochastic Optimization and Computational Game Theory - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>This paper develops a mathematical model for a lease contract equipment with continuously monitoring through condition based maintenance (CBM). This equipment is used in dynamic environment and can be either use in normal stress (N) or severe/high stress (H) and the failure depends on the usage intensity of the equipment. The transitions from N to H and form H to N occur in a random manner. So we model the transitions by a two state continuous time Markov chain formulation. The usage intensity varies across the population of users and is modeled as a continuous random variable. Since the equipment degradation and failure depends on the usage intensity, this in turn has an impact on the expected lease contract cost. Finally we find numerically the optimal inspection time which minimizes the expected lease contract using non-cooperative game theory.

The numerical simulation of these complex cardiac models is very challenging since it requires high-resolution space and time discretizations, as well as numerical tools that can handle natural discontinuities (for instance, disconnected cells).    
Here we consider a cardiac microscopic model, which is able to describe a cell-by-cell framework. We show how physiological discontinuities can be naturally included through a standard space discretization.    
Then, we build an ad-hoc non-overlapping domain decomposition preconditioner for the solution of the associated algebraic system. This preconditioner relies on the one introduced by [Dryja et al.

The former has been changing over the past 30 years, especially with increasing power of computing centers, while the later was largely untouched and still provides rather worse case scenarios (pessimistic estimates). In this talk, I present my work on accuracy and reproducibility assuring strategies for parallel iterative solvers that may not hold due to the non-associativity of floating-point operations; these strategies primarily rely on guarding every bit of resulting computation until the final rounding, hence they can be costly. Driven by the energy consumption constraint for computing centers and, hence, computations, scientists began a revision of applications, algorithms, as well as the underlying working / storage precision. The main aim is to make the computing cost sustainable and apply the lagom principle, especially when it comes to precision but also to the error estimates. Hence, I will also present preliminary results on probabilistic (aka optimistic) error analysis that closely captures the actual accumulated error.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75549' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(798)' class='star'><span class='star798'>&star;</span></a> Sara M.

Thus in order to enhance users’ ability to manage and examine practical, real-world datasets, we have extended the functionality of PyDMD to include several of these recent DMD developments. In this talk, an overview is given for a variety of modern DMD innovations that will debut in this major update to PyDMD.

The stability analysis of the model was conducted to determine free and endemic equilibrium. The exact solutions of the models were obtained using analytic technique. The basic reproduction number was determined using the next generation matrix approach. The local and global stability were carried out using Routh-Hurwitz conditions and the Castillo-chavez criterion. The numerical computations of the exact solutions were also done using Mathematica software. The result obtained shows that, the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction   otherwise it’s unstable.

Metabolism, in turn, relies on the delivery of metabolites and removal of toxic byproducts through diffusion processes and the cerebral blood flow. A comprehensive mathematical model of brain metabolism, should account not only for the biochemical processes and the interaction of neurons and astrocytes, but also the diffusion of metabolites. We present a computational methodology based on a multidomain modeling view of the brain tissue using a homogenization argument to account for the diffusion processes. In our spatially distributed compartment model, communication between compartments occur both through local transport fluxes, as is the case within local astrocyte-neuron complexes, and through diffusion of some substances in some of the compartments. Our model assumes that diffusion takes place in the extracellular space (ECS) and in the astrocyte compartment, where its strength depends on the strength of the gap-junctions. The diffusion process is implemented numerically by means of a finite element method (FEM) based spatial discretization, and robust stiff solvers are used to time integrate the resulting large systems. Computed experiments investigate how the effects of ECS tortuosity, gap junction strength and spatial anisotropies in the astrocyte network affect the brain energy metabolism.

These thermal properties are parameterised using a level-set function that defines the region of anomalous thermal conductivity (from the potential presence of thermal bridges), as well as random fields that characterise variability in thermal properties within each region of the wall. Parameters are inferred via EKI in a Bayesian setting given data from multiple sources including surface temperatures from thermal camera images and thermocouples as well as surface heat flux measurements from heat flux meters. We show numerical examples with synthetic and real data in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed EKI framework in practical settings.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75191' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(637)' class='star'><span class='star637'>&star;</span></a> Traian Iliescu  <span id='bitlink-2687'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2687)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2687' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2687)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reduced Order Modeling of the Quasi-Geostrophic Equations</b><br />Traian Iliescu<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-140.html'>Reduced Order Methods for Geophysical Problems - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>We summarize some recent reduced order model (ROM) developments for the quasi-geostrophic equations (QGE) (also known as the barotropic vorticity equations).  The QGE are a simplified model for geophysical flows in which rotation plays a central role, such as wind-driven ocean circulation in mid-latitude ocean basins. Since the QGE represent a practical compromise between efficient  numerical simulations of ocean flows and accurate representations of large scale ocean dynamics, these equations have often been used in the testing of new numerical methods for ocean flows.  ROMs have also been tested on the QGE for various settings in order to understand their potential in  efficient numerical simulations of ocean flows.  We survey the ROMs developed for the QGE in order to understand their potential in efficient numerical simulations of more complex ocean flows: We explain how classical numerical methods for the QGE are used to generate the ROM basis functions, we outline the main steps in the construction of projection-based ROMs (with a particular focus on the under-resolved regime, when the closure problem needs to be addressed), we illustrate the ROMs in the numerical simulation of the QGE for various settings, and we present several potential future research avenues in the ROM exploration of the QGE and more complex models of geophysical flows.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75434' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(963)' class='star'><span class='star963'>&star;</span></a> S&#233;bastien P.

The main idea is to add to the wave equation a stabilizing term which damps the high-frequency oscillating components of the solutions such as spurious waves.

Nested Monte Carlo and related methods are popular approaches to estimating EIG.  We note two issues with the use of these estimators.  The first is the effect that outliers can have in the estimators when they are undersampled.  The second is the sensitivity of experiments to perturbations in the prior: the sensitivity of an experiment's EIG to perturbations in the prior should affect its suitability in a risk averse situation.  We propose a quantity called robust expected information gain (REIG) that maximizes the minimum EIG over perturbations in the prior which maps onto a fast post-processing of Monte Carlo estimators, which in some cases can also address the outlier affect.  We show numerical experiments comparing REIG estimators to EIG estimators on simple problems, then on an OED problem modeling experiments with catalysis reactors to determine kinematic reaction coefficients.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75554' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(516)' class='star'><span class='star516'>&star;</span></a> Mariya Ishteva  <span id='bitlink-2691'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2691)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2691' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2691)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Decoupling Multivariate Functions</b><br />Mariya Ishteva<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-113.html'>Sparse Computations in Science and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>While linear functions are well-understood, for nonlinear (multivariate vector) functions it is unclear how to i) define their complexity, ii) reduce the complexity and iii) increase their interpretability.

In order to analyze the resulting regression errors, a novel stability result of kernel regression with respect to the Wasserstein distance is derived. This allows us to bound errors that occur when perturbed input data is used to fit a kernel function. We combine the stability result with known estimates from the literature on both principal component analysis and kernel regression to obtain convergence rates for the two-step procedure.

Thereby, the NPZD model---a stiff, positive and conservative system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) describing the ecosystem of phytoplankton---arises as a sub-problem.    
For solving the NPZD model we compare standard ODE solvers and an unconditionally positive and conservative modified Patankar--Runge--Kutta method (MPRK) with respect to their efficiency. Thereby, we confirm that only the MPRK scheme is positive for all time step sizes while the remaining schemes face severe time step restrictions in order to maintain positive approximations. As a result,  MPRK schemes may choose  the maximal time step size coming from an explicit time integration of the advection-diffusion part also for the reaction part, whereas the standard ODE solvers must choose an even smaller time step size leading to an overall higher computational effort.

Secondly, the kernel $P^{m,k}$ must be designed to vanish the first up to the $m^{th}$ moments and $k$ continuous derivatives at the endpoints of the compact support. To vanish the moments the regularized delta can have negative values. The vanishing moments ensure that the regularized Dirac delta kernel converges to the exact Dirac delta function at $O(\epsilon^{m+1})$ rate. This moment property is necessary for the construction of high-order approximations of singular Dirac delta source terms in spectral approximations of PDEs [Jean-Piero et al., SIAM SISC, 2014]. To preserve high-order spatial accuracy it was further shown that the optimal value for the compact support must be $\epsilon=N_x^{-k/(m+k+2)}$. We will discuss applications of this kernel to solve PDEs with high-order order accuracy including PDEs with singular sources, the regularized solution of PDEs that admit singular solutions, and the approximation of deterministic initial conditions of governing PDEs for probability density functions.

Sometimes, the values cannot be returned because the experiment failed or the simulation crashed. This causes to lose an evaluation in the budget for a point that brings very little information. In such case, it is said that the point hits a 'hidden constraint'. Therefore, it becomes helpful to avoid those hidden constraints and use the information given by the fact that a point is hitting or not a hidden constraint. This presentation offers different ways to handle those hidden constraints using surrogates and subproblem formulations in the algorithm MADS and shows numerical results.      </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75456' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1612)' class='star'><span class='star1612'>&star;</span></a> Janin J&#228;ger  <span id='bitlink-2697'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2697)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2697' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2697)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Theoretical Foundations of Kernel Methods on Compact Manifolds</b><br />Janin J&#228;ger<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-356.html'>Efficient Kernel Methods - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>The focus of this talk is the study of non-isotropic kernels on compact Riemannian manifolds with approximation  properties similar to those of classically studied radial kernels.

A class of functions for which the resulting interpolation problem is uniquely  solvable for any distinct point sets is the class of strictly  positive definite kernels. For kernels possessing a certain series expansion in  eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M^d$  , we derive a characterisation of this class. We give more specific results for two-point homogeneous  manifolds and the sphere.  For the special case of $S^{d-1}$  , we study the connection between geometric  properties of the kernel and the coefficients in the series expansion.

In this work we study oscillatory flow in stenosed  geometries to quantify and characterize the onset of turbulence in zero mean  oscillatory flows.    
Simulations on a stenosed pipe in axisymmetric and eccentric configurations  were conducted using the LBM solver Musubi with various Reynolds numbers and  pulsation frequencies. Stenosis with area reduction of 75%, 60%, 50% and 25%  were studied in both axisymmetric and eccentric configurations. Meshes of up to  2.8 billion cells were created and simulations were conducted on 300’000 CPU  cores of the SuperMUC-NG petascale system in Munich, GERMANY.    
Main findings include:  1. The flow transitions only in higher degrees of stenosis namely 50%, 60% and  75%, where Re~1800 is the approximate threshold for transition.  2. The flow reversal stabilizes the flow field.  3. A higher pulsation frequency leads to earlier breakdown of flow – a phenomenon  that is seen mostly for lower stenoses degrees.  4. The eccentricity of the stenosis is one of the major factors for flow  transition.    
The results advocate that transition to turbulence is a possibility in  physiologic flows, and the geometry of the conduit is the most prominent factor  that results in the onset of turbulence.

Model reduction techniques based in rigorous dynamical systems theory aim to reduce such nonlinear systems over low-dimensional, attracting invariant manifolds. The low-dimensional dynamics of these invariant manifolds acts as a mathematically exact reduced-order model for the full, high-dimensional system. In particular, the recent theory of Spectral Submanifolds (SSM) allows for such a rigorous model reduction and leads to reliable steady-state response predictions within feasible computation times. Further developments have made the direct computation of such invariant manifolds and their reduced dynamics scalable to realistic, nonlinear finite-element models.    
In this talk, we review the basics of SSM theory and computation. We demonstrate applications of SSM-based reduced-order models towards the extraction of nonlinear forced response curves in realistic finite-element models of mechanical systems.

Therein, a noisy version of the cost function’s gradient is utilized as a search direction, where the noise originates, e.g., due to data sampling. There have been several recent studies showing that the gradient noise that arises in many scenarios, e.g., when training deep learning models, is heavy-tailed. In distributed environments, an additional source of heavy-tailed noise is the imperfect communication between different computing units, e.g., nodes in a wireless sensor network. In this context, we develop both centralized and distributed SGD-type algorithms that provably work in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient and/or communication noises. The methods are based on introducing a generic nonlinearity in the iterate updates in order to combat the noise. We provide for the methods strong convergence and convergence rate guarantees, including almost sure, mean square rate, and asymptotic normality, in a challenging heavy-tailed setting, when noises are of infinite variance. We present the analysis for two different settings: 1) centralized SGD algorithms that provably work under heavy-tailed gradient noise and generic cost functions; and 2) distributed algorithms for stochastic quadratic costs (corresponding to a distributed estimation scenario) that provably work under heavy-tailed gradient and/or communication noises.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75779' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1376)' class='star'><span class='star1376'>&star;</span></a> Revathi Jambunathan  <span id='bitlink-2702'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2702)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2702' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2702)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fully Kinetic Simulations of Pulsar Magnetospheres Using WarpX</b><br />Revathi Jambunathan<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-304.html'>Kinetic Simulations of Astrophysical Processes - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars immersed in strong electromagnetic fields that emit twin beams of electromagnetic radiation. However, the plasma composition and structure in the region surrounding pulsars, called magnetospheres, and the physical processes that drive particle acceleration leading to the observed spectra are not well understood. Global pulsar magnetosphere simulations are required to answer these questions. However, resolving the current sheet skin-depth which is O(106) smaller than the pulsar radius for realistic systems, is intractable even on large supercomputers. Thus, the magnetic field strength in global PIC simulations is typically scaled-down, restricting the maximum energy of the charged particles. We will present the effect of scaling down the magnetic field on particle acceleration, energy dissipation, and Poynting flux. We use WarpX, a highly scalable, electromagnetic PIC code with advanced algorithms to mitigate numerical artifacts in mesh-refinement simulations. We will also present 3D simulations to study the effect of pulsar obliquity and plasma injection rate on the plasma structure and Poynting flux. Additionally, we explore the use of ultra high-order spectral methods (PSATD) to perform pulsar magnetosphere simulations and compare their accuracy and performance with traditional finite-difference methods.

This wide diffusion is due to its effectiveness in solving linear systems arising from PDE discretizations. The key feature of AMG is its optimality, i.e., the ability to guarantee a convergence rate independent of the mesh size for different problems. This is obtained through a good interplay between the smoother and the interpolation. Unfortunately, for difficult problems, such as those arising in industrial applications, standard AMG techniques are not effective and more elaborate strategies and algorithms need to be developed. The implementation of novel AMG methods became even more difficult with the advent of many-core hardware such as GPU accelerators. While AMG application simply consists in matrix by vector products that have been already successfully ported on GPU by a number of authors, the set-up stage needs to be completely re-designed. In this work, we present the AMG preconditioner included in Chronos, tailored for industrial applications from both solid mechanics and CFD and entirely running on GPU. Thanks to some numerical experiments we will show its performance and scalability on real-world problems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75648' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1740)' class='star'><span class='star1740'>&star;</span></a> Niclas Jansson  <span id='bitlink-2704'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2704)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2704' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2704)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Refactoring Legacy Fortran Applications to Leverage Modern Heterogeneous Architectures in Extreme-Scale CFD</b><br />Niclas Jansson<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-383.html'>Cross-Cutting Aspects of Utilizing Exascale Platforms for High-Fidelity CFD - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Recent trends and advancement in including more diverse and heterogeneous hardware in High-Performance Computing is challenging software developers in their pursuit for good performance and numerical stability.

Unlike prior works, Neko adopts a modern object-oriented Fortran 2008 approach, allowing multi-tier abstractions of the solver stack and facilitating various hardware backends ranging from general-purpose processors, accelerators down to exotic vector processors and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) via Neko's device abstraction layer.

In particular we focus on modelling a cooperating fleet of forklifters (FL's) as an $N$-vertex-graph $(V,E,w)$. The vertex set $V$ splits in stationary (e.g. charging stations, pick/drop-places) and moving vertices (FL's), the edge-set $E$ represents cooperation or source/sink-relations of the connected vertices, the weight function $w$ quantifies these relations.  As an example we study the task of optimal placement of charging stations for battery-driven FL's based on recorded motion and task data of the fleet.   One idea is to connect stationary (charging stations) with moving vertices (FL's) with a proper edge set $E$ and weight function $w$ and to measure the 'importance' of the charging stations at their individual position by a properly modified pagerank-like algorithm.  Alternatively in this graph we may consider the state of charge (SOC) of the individual FL's as a graph signal $f$ and perform a sensitivity analysis to its graph Fourier transform $\hat{f}$, when the positions of the charging stations are varied.  Apart from these examples we also show simulations of GSP-like models of FL-fleets. These simulations rely on CARLA; an open source tool developed mainly in the context of autonomous driving.  The reported work comes from a cooperation of the Aschaffenburg University of Applied Sciences with a local manufacturer of fork lifters.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75789' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1032)' class='star'><span class='star1032'>&star;</span></a> Carlos Jerez-Hanckes  <span id='bitlink-2706'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2706)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2706' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2706)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multilevel Domain Uncertainty Quantification In Computational Electromagnetics</b><br />Carlos Jerez-Hanckes<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-226.html'>Novel Multilevel Methods for Uncertainty Quantification</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>We study the numerical approximation of time-harmonic electromagnetic fields for the Maxwell lossy cavity problem for uncertain geometries. We adopt the same affine-parametric shape parametrization framework, mapping the physical domains to a nominal polygonal domain with piecewise smooth maps. The regularity of the pullback solutions on the nominal domain is characterized in piecewise Sobolev spaces.  We prove error convergence rates and optimize the algorithmic steering of parameters for edge-element discretizations in the nominal domain combined with: (a) multilevel Monte Carlo sampling, and (b) multilevel, sparse-grid quadrature for computing the expectation of the solutions with respect to uncertain domain ensembles. In addition, we analyze sparse-grid interpolation to compute surrogates of the domain-to-solution mappings. All calculations are performed on the polyhedral nominal domain, which enables the use of standard simplicial finite element meshes. We provide a rigorous fully discrete error analysis and  show, in all cases, that dimension-independent algebraic convergence is achieved. For the multilevel sparse-grid quadrature methods, we prove higher order convergence rates which are free from the so-called curse of dimensionality, i.e.~independent of the number of parameters used to parametrize the admissible shapes. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results and verify the superiority of the sparse-grid methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75548' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1523)' class='star'><span class='star1523'>&star;</span></a> Abhinav Jha  <span id='bitlink-2707'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2707)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2707' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2707)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Grids for Algebraic Stabilizations of Convection-Diffusion-Reaction Equations</b><br />Abhinav Jha<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-335.html'>Adaptive Mesh Refinement: Algorithms and Applications - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>Non-linear discretizations are necessary for convection-diffusion-reaction equations for obtaining accurate solutions that satisfy the discrete maximum principle (DMP). Algebraic stabilizations belong to the very few finite element discretizations that satisfy this property.     
This talk considers three algebraically stabilized finite element schemes for discretizing convection-diffusion-reaction equations on adaptively refined grids. These schemes are the algebraic flux correction (AFC) scheme with Kuzmin limiter, the AFC scheme with BJK limiter, and the recently proposed Monotone Upwind-type Algebraically Stabilized (MUAS) method. Both conforming closure of the refined grids   and grids with hanging vertices are considered based on a residual-based a posteriori error estimator.    
A non-standard algorithmic step becomes necessary before these schemes can be applied on grids with hanging vertices.  The assessment of the schemes is performed with respect   to the satisfaction of the global discrete maximum principle (DMP), the accuracy, e.g., smearing of layers, and the efficiency in solving the corresponding nonlinear problems.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75740' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1834)' class='star'><span class='star1834'>&star;</span></a> Hui Ji  <span id='bitlink-2708'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2708)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2708' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2708)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Self-Supervised Deep Image Restoration via Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</b><br />Hui Ji<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-404.html'>Learning Deep Neural Networks and Sparse Approximations from Limited Data for High-Dimensional Problems in Computational Science and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>While supervised deep learning has been a prominent tool for solving many image restoration problems, there is an increasing interest on studying self-supervised or un- supervised methods to address the challenges and costs of collecting truth images.

For  computing solution estimates, we develop hybrid projection methods for solution decomposition that are based on a combined flexible and generalized Golub-Kahan processes. This approach integrates  techniques from the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization and the flexible Krylov methods. The benefits of the proposed methods are that the decomposition of the solution can be done iteratively,  and the regularization terms and regularization parameters are adaptively chosen at each iteration. Numerical results from photoacoustic tomography and atmospheric inverse modeling demonstrate the potential for these methods to be used for anomaly detection.

Comparison of classical PINNs, variational PINNs (VPINNs) and variational energy based PINNs (VE-PINNs) to solve a simple 1D problem leads us to conclude that the variational approaches may be more accurate than the standards PINNs, whilst VPINNs is less straightforward to implement than VE-PINNs: leading to a preference for the latter. This is then deployed for the solution of more challenging phase-field problems in two dimensions and the performance is analysed in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Our conclusions suggest that, whilst accurate solutions are certainly achievable for this class of problem, further research is required to ensure the robustness and the generalization of the approach.  	    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75276' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(757)' class='star'><span class='star757'>&star;</span></a> Yury A.

Approximately 1 in 4 people will suffer from a mental disorder throughout their lives and between 35% and 50% will receive inadequate treatment, causing up to 800,000 suicides each year. Minimising the time that elapses between the appearance of the first symptoms and the application of the treatment is key to recovery, as it can reduce the severity of the pathology or even slow down its development. In adolescents, especially, if symptoms are not detected and treated in time, it could persist in the adult stage in more severe forms. Each person has different symptomatology and emotional state changes can be suddenly triggered by endogenous and/or exogenous factors, which makes detecting symptoms challenging. One common symptom for many mental illnesses is significant changes in sleep patterns, such as inability to fall asleep, to stay awake, or to get up in the morning. The main objective of this research is to characterize the emotional state of each person in order to predict future changes by analysing their sleeping activity. With that aim, this research presents a mathematical model that allows the characterization of a personalized emotional state.  The data used by the model are collected in real time by an alternative and non-intrusive sleep monitoring system that works without the need of supervision or intervention from the monitored person, guaranteeing thus that the data are reliable

One approach to alleviate this cost is by building multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate models that combine a small number of HF simulations with a larger number of less expensive lower-fidelity (LF) simulations. We focus on using Karhunen-Loève expansions (KLEs) as surrogate models, which are based on low-rank spectral approximations that can effectively characterize random field (e.g., spatio-temporal) quantities. We build KLEs in a multi-fidelity manner by retaining the connections to the physical sources of uncertainty through the use of polynomial chaos expansions inside an LF KLE and an additive correction KLE. Predictions can then be generated rapidly for any input parameter value, and greatly accelerate the UQ computations. When additional high-fidelity simulations can be performed to further improve the surrogate model, we propose an active-learning framework to strategically select new simulation points in the input parameter space. We achieve this by using a Gaussian Process (GP) to represent the current MF surrogate error, and use Expected Improvement to find the point with the highest expected surrogate error for performing the next HF simulation. We show the advantages of the overall method on benchmark problems and field quantities from a turbulent round jet application.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75505' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(701)' class='star'><span class='star701'>&star;</span></a> Andrey Jivkov  <span id='bitlink-2714'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2714)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2714' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2714)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Background Independent Formulations of Conservation Laws in Structured Solids</b><br />Andrey Jivkov<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-154.html'>Exterior Calculus in Numerical Computing, Modeling, and Simulation - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>The approximation of materials as continuous solids leads to the classical formulations of conservation of scalar (mass, energy, charge) and vector (linear and angular momentum) quantities in terms of their densities. Such formulations do not allow for describing localisations of properties and processes by underlying material structures. One approach to address the deficiency of the classical formulations is to consider explicitly the internal structures of engineering materials as assemblies of discrete, finite cells with different apparent dimensions. Calculus on such cell complexes was born at the beginning of this century. It offers great opportunities for revisiting and reformulating the descriptions and analyses of real materials. The talk will show the development of discrete analogues of the conservation laws relevant to the analysis of materials with complex internal structures. These are based on the notions of combinatorial vector fields and differential forms on cell complexes. Topological, i.e., metric-independent, as well as metric-dependent operation of such forms will be discussed, together with the strategy that combines them into intrinsic, i.e., background-independent, descriptions of the conservation laws.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75449' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(221)' class='star'><span class='star221'>&star;</span></a> Hans Johansen  <span id='bitlink-2715'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2715)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2715' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2715)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Exposing AMR Application Interfaces for Time Integrators</b><br />Hans Johansen<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-48.html'>High-Performance Computing in the FASTMath SciDAC-5 Institute - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>We will discuss software design and lessons learned from our experience implementing SUNDIALS time integrators in the Chombo-based BISICLES ice sheet code.

Furthermore the development of physical models via traditional methods is particularly time-consuming in human terms.  Developing comparably accurate models directly from data can enable rapid development of accurate models as well as more robust design, uncertainty quantification, and exhaustive structure-property exploration.  We have been developing neural network models that are guided by traditional constitutive theory, such as tensor function representation theorems to embed symmetries, and also exploiting deep learning to infer intrinsic microstructural features.  Neural networks are flexible since sub-components of their graph-like structure can be arranged to suit particular tasks, such as image processing and time integration, and represent the mechanistic flow of information.  This talk will describe the architectures and demonstrate the efficacy of neural networks designed to model the response of complex history-dependent materials with pores, inclusions or grains based solely on observable data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75276' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1989)' class='star'><span class='star1989'>&star;</span></a> Anirudh Jonnalagadda  <span id='bitlink-2717'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2717)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2717' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2717)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>PeleSurface: A Low Mach Number Heterogeneous Chemistry Solver for Catalytic Combustion Simulations</b><br />Anirudh Jonnalagadda<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-410.html'>Models and Software for Multiscale Computational Chemistry</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>Catalyst-assisted heterogeneous reacting flows are a ubiquitous and integral component of several chemical industries. As such, a thorough understanding of the interactions between the reacting flow and catalytic media is of significant value to both academia as well as industry. In this work, to enable high fidelity numerical explorations of catalytic combustion processes, we build upon the adaptive mesh refinement enabled, low Mach number reacting flow solver, PeleLM (https://amrex-combustion.github.io/PeleLM/), and present a new catalytic reacting flow solver called PeleSurface. The required pore-scale heterogeneous chemical kinetics and surface-species specific thermodynamic information adhere to the SURFACE-CHEMKIN standard and are implemented within the PelePhysics library (https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PelePhysics). Since the framework employed is suited for high performance exascale compute architectures, the proposed solver is expected to facilitate large scale numerical workloads of catalytic reacting flows with detailed reaction chemistry for problems of theoretical and practical relevance.

Inspired by the Nonlinear Level set Learning (NLL) method that uses the reversible residual network (RevNet), in this paper we propose a new method of Dimension Reduction via Learning Level Sets (DRiLLS) for function approximation. Our method contains two major components: one is the pseudo-reversible neural network (PRNN) module that effectively transforms high-dimensional input variables to low-dimensional active variables, and the other is the synthesized regression module for approximating function values based on the transformed data in the low-dimensional space. The PRNN not only relaxes the invertibility constraint of the nonlinear transformation present in the NLL method due to the use of RevNet, but also adaptively weights the influence of each sample and controls the sensitivity of the function to the learned active variables. The synthesized regression uses Euclidean distance in the input space to select neighboring samples, whose projections on the space of active variables are used to perform local least-squares polynomial fitting. This helps to resolve numerical oscillation issues present in traditional local and global regressions.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75624' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1946)' class='star'><span class='star1946'>&star;</span></a> Austin T.

The interior environments in such infrastructure can be complicated and diverse, which makes it important to safeguard people in the event of a fire and get them to the nearest safe exit quickly. Hence, in this work, we propose a Q-learning based approach to find a deadline-aware adaptive emergency navigation strategy in buildings with WSNs, which informs each customer about a hazard-avoided evacuation path to successfully reach safe exit gates within the specified deadline under all circumstances. For this, the proposed approach analyzes the intensity of fire to predict the specific limited evacuation time and then, an online navigation strategy is proposed based on a real-time adaptive routing algorithm to maximize and ensure the user's safety. The proposed approach is evaluated by conducting extensive simulations and prototype experiments.

The LAC has been originally proposed by extracting the common properties from thousands of plane curves that car designers regard as aesthetic, which includes various spirals as special cases, such as the circle involute, the clothoid, the Nielsen's spiral, and the logarithmic spiral.    
We present a new mathematical framework of the LAC on the theory of integrable systems and the similarity geometry, a Klein geometry associated with the similarity transformation group. Using this framework, we show that the similarity curvature is governed by the stationary Burgers equation and that the LAC is characterized by the variational principle. Namely, the LAC can be regarded as the similarity geometry analogue of the celebrated Euler’s elasticae in the Euclidean geometry.  Based on this result, we present some generalizations of LAC: (i) integrable discretization, (ii) space curves, and (iii) surfaces. We expect that those curves and surfaces may be useful for generating “aesthetic shapes”.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75347' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1701)' class='star'><span class='star1701'>&star;</span></a> Vasileios Kalantzis  <span id='bitlink-2726'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2726)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2726' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2726)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Domain Decomposition Rayleigh-Ritz Algorithm for Symmetric Generalized Eigenvalue Problem</b><br />Vasileios Kalantzis<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-376.html'>Advances and Challenges in Eigensolutions and Industrial Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>In this talk we propose a distributed-memory parallel algorithm for computing all the  eigenvalues (and corresponding eigenvectors) of a large, sparse, real symmetric  positive definite matrix pencil that lie within a target interval.

The experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies help us to understand the dynamics of hydrodynamically unstable turbulent flows such as Kelvin-Helmholtz, Rayleigh-Taylor, and Richtmyer-Meshkov Instabilities. In this talk, we present an increasingly accurate and robust front tracking method for the numerical simulations of single mode Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability (RMI) of an air/SF6 interface. The front tracking method is used to track the interface explicitly with high order accuracy. This technique stores and dynamically evolves a meshed front that partitions a simulation domain into two or more regions, each representing a different material or physics model. The simulations based on front tracking with the classical weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes in Jiang and Shu (1996) with Yang's artificial compression and Balsara and Shu (2000) are compared with Collins and Jacobs (2002) shock tube experiments. We address verification and validation issues to achieve good agreement on the amplitude and the displacement of interface at all times including the pre-reshock and post-reshock.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77157' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1089)' class='star'><span class='star1089'>&star;</span></a> Shoaib Kamil  <span id='bitlink-2729'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2729)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2729' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2729)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Halide: Growing Dopsies from Research Projects to Industrial Adoption</b><br />Shoaib Kamil<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-239.html'>From Math to Code: Domain-Specific Programming Abstractions, Languages, and Frameworks - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>While research into domain-specific programming systems ("dopsies") continues to expand, only a few of these systems have matured enough to find adoption outside of small research communities.

Typically, the main bottleneck in optimization of these models are contractions of a single large sparse tensor with a network of several dense matrices or tensors (SpTTN). Prior works on high-performance tensor decomposition and completion have focused on performance and scalability optimizations for specific SpTTN kernels.      We present algorithms and a runtime system for identifying and executing the most efficient loop nest for any SpTTN kernel. We consider both enumeration of such loop nests for autotuning and efficient algorithms for finding the lowest cost loop-nest for simpler metrics, such as buffer size or cache miss models. Our runtime system identifies the best choice of loop nest without user guidance, and also provides a distributed-memory parallelization of SpTTN kernels. We evaluate our framework using both real-world and synthetic tensors. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms available generalized state-of-the-art libraries and matches the performance of specialized codes.

Since the two-dimensional barotropic system has a gravity-induced wave speed which is around two orders of magnitude faster than the three-dimensional advection-dominated baroclinic mode, numerical stability and model performance are strongly dependent on numerical methods solving the barotropic system. A scalable semi-implicit barotropic mode solver for the Model for Prediction Across Scale-Ocean (MPAS-O) has been implemented as a competitor of the default explicit-subcycling solver. The barotropic system is discretized in time with the Crank-Nicolson method. As a Krylov subspace solver, we use the single synchronization biconjugate gradient stabilized solver that has one global synchronization point per solver iteration. To accelerate the convergence of this solver, the restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner is introduced. Before the construction of the RAS preconditioning matrix, the global coefficient matrix is reordered to make a near-block diagonal form to obtain optimal performance. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that the semi-implicit barotropic mode solver has faster computational performance up to two times compared to the default solver while maintaining the numerical accuracy. Moreover, GPU acceleration of this semi-implicit solver is underway. We will briefly introduce this work at the minisymposium.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75567' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(14)' class='star'><span class='star14'>&star;</span></a> Michelle Kanipe  <span id='bitlink-2733'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2733)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2733' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2733)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Dynamical System Analysis of a Rich Cloud Model and Implications for Cloud Aggregation</b><br />Michelle Kanipe<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-3.html'>Understanding Cloud Physics Using Stochastic, Dynamical, and Data-Driven Modeling - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Shallow-cumulus evolution and self-organization, or aggregation, into different cloud patterns is a complicated process, with many not well understood elements.

In collaboration with many other scientists, we have worked intensively with policy-makers to fight the pandemic. I will present an overview of our pandemic-related research: a) A new modelling framework (Lau et al, Proc. R. Soc. A, 2022) for the airborne transmission of viruses that quickly determines the infection risk in an indoor space, as ventilation changes. The model agrees well with real superspreading events during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be used in future epidemics. b) An agent-based modelling framework (Moore et al, COVID, 2021) that allows quick decision-making and comparison of mitigations in educational settings. We find that, although frequent testing can be used to reduce the number of infected students, investment in masks and ventilation is more effective. c) Modelling air purifiers. Air purifiers can be used to improve ventilation and reduce infection risk from SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in indoor spaces. It is, however, frequently not clear where to place them and how strong they should be. Hence, deploying them to schools, hospitals and other spaces poses interesting challenges for policy-makers and managers of spaces. We provide solutions to some of these challenges.

However, it is an open question what numerical precision is required for a specific simulation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). While we have conventionally relied on double-precision arithmetics, several factors affect what numerical precision is required to obtain a resolved flow field. In this presentation, we talk about our work to assess how the numerical precision requirements depend on the fluid scales and simulation size, both in theory and practice. We investigate how numerical precision affects a series of different flow cases and try to isolate the impact of numerical precision and connect it to the dynamics and properties of the considered flow cases. To do this we perform experiments with different discretization schemes and perform a series of computational experiments. We focus on direct numerical simulations and shed some light on what machine epsilon is required in the best case to perform a resolved CFD simulation. Finally, we address whether even higher numerical precision will be required in order to perform direct numerical simulations on exascale and post-exascale parallel systems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75849' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1176)' class='star'><span class='star1176'>&star;</span></a> Peter Karpov  <span id='bitlink-2738'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2738)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2738' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2738)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Latest Improvements of the Elpa Eigenvalue Solvers</b><br />Peter Karpov<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-258.html'>High-Performance Algorithms for Large Scale Eigenvalue Problems in Physical Simulations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>In the electronic structure community, the solution of eigenvalue problems lies at the core of the numerical approaches and in  most simulation packages the numerical eigenvalue solver can consume a substantial fraction of the complete runtime.

Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are high order discretizations, promising for simulation of unsteady compressible fluid flow in three dimensions. Systems arising from such discretizations of turbulent fluid motion are often stiff, and require implicit time integration. This requires fast, parallel, low-memory solvers for the algebraic equation systems that arise.  For (low order) finite volume (FV) methods, multigrid (MG) methods have been successfully applied for this purpose. But for high order DG such solver are currently lacking.  This deficiency inhibits wider adoption of DG methods, and motivates our research to construct a matrix free preconditioner for high order DG discretizations. The preconditioner is based on a multigrid method constructed for a low order finite volume discretization defined on a subgrid of the DG mesh. Numerical experiments on atmospheric flow problems show the benefit of this approach.

We further demonstrate how to enforce Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions (BCs) exactly for the predicted PDE solution field. Our numerical experiments show that this can reduce training time and increase accuracy of the predicted solution compared to standard PINNs with Fourier Feature embedding.  Evolutional neural network (ENNs) use a time-stepping scheme based on the PDE residual to evolve the network parameters such that at each time step, the parameter state allows to predict the PDE solution. Our proposed modified PINNs eliminate the BC loss term and thus allow to extend this paradigm to more general geometries.

We utilize training data from computationally intensive high-fidelity discrete fracture network simulations, augmented by easily generated low-fidelity (i.e. noisy) graph flow models, in a multi-fidelity approach. Specifically, we take advantage of Bayesian methods to predict the high-fidelity model output, along with uncertainty bounds. In this way, we aim to generate rapid and accurate predictions of particle breakthrough times, orders of magnitude faster than the simulations themselves, with associated uncertainty quantification.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75392' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1433)' class='star'><span class='star1433'>&star;</span></a> Daniel S.

People outside the community see these changes, and then also take up these practices.

The NDE is a coupled system of nonlinear Volterra integral equations, for which the history integrals lead to $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ computational complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory complexity for $N$ time steps in traditional solvers.  Our method is based on the empirical observation that for many problems of physical interest, the kernels of the integral operators in the NDE, as well as its solutions, can be represented as hierarchical off-diagonal low rank (HODLR) matrices. We present an algorithm which builds these HODLR representations on the fly during the course of time stepping, and uses the them to reduce the cost of computing history integrals. For systems with the hierarchical low rank property, our method achieves $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$ computational complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ memory complexity. We present numerical examples demonstrating orders of magnitude speedup and memory reduction over previous methods, and reaching unprecedented propagation times.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75258' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(460)' class='star'><span class='star460'>&star;</span></a> Yoshihito Kazashi  <span id='bitlink-2744'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2744)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2744' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2744)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Density Estimation in RKHS with Application to Korobov Spaces in High Dimensions</b><br />Yoshihito Kazashi<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-102.html'>High-Dimensional Approximation and Reduced-Order Models - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we will consider a kernel method for estimating a probability density function (pdf) from an i.i.d. sample drawn from such density.

We focus on a multilevel approximation scheme based on the tensor decomposition known as matrix product states (MPS) in computational quantum physics and as tensor train (TT) in computational mathematics. This scheme has been shown, both theoretically and experimentally, to efficiently approximate functions with algebraic singularities and highly-oscillatory solutions to multiscale diffusion problems, achieving exponential convergence with respect to the total number of representation parameters.    
We present recent results on the use of the multilevel MPS-TT representation for the numerical solution of elliptic and parabolic PDE problems, which involves the multilevel preconditioning and the iterative solution of resulting linear systems in low-rank form. The approach is based on generic finite-element spaces and amounts to the adaptive computation of a collection of quasi-optimal low-dimensional subspaces. The use of low-rank tensor approximation in combination with robust multilevel preconditioning allows to work with extravagantly large finite-element spaces and leads to data-driven computations with effective discretizations adapted to the data, which contrasts with the use of approximation spaces designed analytically.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75656' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(838)' class='star'><span class='star838'>&star;</span></a> Jens Keim  <span id='bitlink-2746'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2746)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2746' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2746)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Relaxation Model for the Approximation of the Non-Isothermal Navier-Stokes-Korteweg Equations Using High-Order Methods</b><br />Jens Keim<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-183.html'>High Order Numerical Methods for Hyperbolic PDEs and Multiphysics Phenomena</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>The non-isothermal Navier-Stokes-Korteweg (NSK) equations are a classical diffuse interface model, which governs two-phase flow that include surface tension and phase transition effects.  However, if the numerical discretization of the NSK system is aimed, several issues have to be resolved.  First, the non-convex bulk Helmholtz free energy induces a non-monotonous pressure function, which in turn results in mixed hyperbolic-elliptic first-order fluxes.  Secondly, the gradient dependence of the underlying energy potential generates a third-order derivative in the momentum equation, which prevents the straight forward use of boundary conditions at the three-phase contact line.   In this talk, we present the non-isothermal extension of our recently presented relaxation formulation for the isothermal NSK equations [T. Hitz, J. Keim, C.-D. Munz, C. Rohde, A parabolic relaxation model for the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations, Journal of Computational Physics, 421 (2020) 109714].  The model is derived from principles of classical irreversible thermodynamics and hence inherently consistent with the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  For an appropriate choice of the relaxation parameters, the model converges to the non-isothermal NSK equations.  The model is discretized by the use of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method.  We demonstrate an excellent agreement with the original NSK model for several one-, two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75485' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(622)' class='star'><span class='star622'>&star;</span></a> Hanne Kekkonen  <span id='bitlink-2747'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2747)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2747' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2747)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Random Tree Besov Priors</b><br />Hanne Kekkonen<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:50 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-136.html'>Statistical Inverse Problems: Theory and Computation - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>We propose alternatives for Bayesian a priori distributions that are frequently used in the study of inverse problems.

That is, PDEs with inputs that are expressed as functions of parameters with an associated probability distribution. Developing efficient and accurate solution strategies that account for errors on the space, time and parameter domains simultaneously is highly challenging. Indeed, it is well known that standard polynomial-based approximations on the parameter domain can incur errors that grow in time. In this work, we focus on advection–diffusion problems with parameter-dependent wind fields. A novel adaptive solution strategy is proposed that allows users to combine stochastic collocation on the parameter domain with off-the-shelf adaptive timestepping algorithms with local error control. This is a non-intrusive strategy that builds a polynomial-based surrogate that is adapted sequentially in time. The algorithm is driven by a so-called hierarchical estimator for the parametric error and balances this against an estimate for the global time-stepping error which is derived from a scaling argument.   	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75548' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1814)' class='star'><span class='star1814'>&star;</span></a> Stefan Kerkemeier  <span id='bitlink-2751'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2751)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2751' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2751)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>NekRS, Next Generation Spectral Element Navier-Stokes Solver</b><br />Stefan Kerkemeier<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-399.html'>Exascale Software and Algorithms for High-Order PDE Solvers - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>This talk is about our next generation CFD code nekRS targeting CPUs and accelerators like GPUs.

The Generalised Langevin Equation formalism provides a rigorous way to describe all memory effects via the so-called memory kernel in an integro-differential equation. However, the memory kernel is often unknown, and accurately predicting or measuring it via e.g. a numerical inverse Laplace transform remains a herculean task. In this talk we will first review the importance and difficulties of measuring realistic memory kernels, and describe our recent progress using deep neural networks (DNNs) to tackle this problem. We demonstrate that DNNs are remarkably robust against noisy data and can therefore successfully circumvent the bottleneck that plagues conventional inverse Laplace transform approaches. Furthermore we show that DNNs are capable of tackling the notoriously long-lived memory effects of glassy systems. Our work will provide a general purpose tool for extracting memory kernels from glasses and supercooled liquids, and, with sufficient data, from a broad range of other non-Markovian systems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75204' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(926)' class='star'><span class='star926'>&star;</span></a> Torsten Ke&#223;ler  <span id='bitlink-2753'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2753)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2753' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2753)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Entropy-Stable Methods for Rarefied Gas Dynamics</b><br />Torsten Ke&#223;ler<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-203.html'>Multiscale Methods for Kinetic Models: Theory and Numerics - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we develop an entropy-stable finite-element-moment method  for the Boltzmann equation with full collision operator.

We associate with each member of this sequence a  normalisation map for the distribution function and an entropy.  We show that each approximate collision operator inherits salient properties  from Boltzmann's operator,  such as the preservation of the collision operator, the H-theorem  and that the linearisations near equilibrium agree.  We prove that our method is entropy-stable  for each member of the sequence of approximations to the collision operator.

With the help of these tools, we wish to make reliable assertions and predictions for one or more quantity of interests (QoI), also in the presence of uncertainty, e.g., in process conditions, material properties or similar. Thus, methods from the field of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) can enhance the quality of processes and products by augmenting the results for the QoI with quantified probability measures.     
We consider sampling-based UQ methods that usually require a great number of model evaluations. Thus, employing high-fidelity models may easily exceed available resources. Here, the usage of surrogate models, which are computationally cheaper, can provide a remedy. Therefore, we first follow the path of Model Order Reduction (MOR). In particular, we explore the benefits of intrusive MOR techniques and use Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with a subsequent Galerkin projection of the operators onto the constructed subspaces. As an alternative, we also investigate the advantages of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) as a meta model. Finally, the integration of the resulting surrogate models into an UQ setting is demonstrated for applications coming from polymer processing.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75552' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1219)' class='star'><span class='star1219'>&star;</span></a> David E.

Such numerical computations for multiple parameters are computationally expensive. A suitable approach to tackle such problems is model order reduction (MOR), where we solve the problem in an appropriate subspace of the high-dimensional discretization space. Standard MOR methods generally exhibit several issues for wave-type problems, including reducibility and potentially weak stability.    
We present a goal-oriented MOR approach for wave-type problems with band-limited output of interests (e.g., in seismology) or damping (e.g., in structural health monitoring). The proposed method combines numerical Laplace inversion within the Greedy algorithm to identify a parameter with the worst reduced basis (RB) approximation. A POD-based compression is then used in the frequency domain to iteratively enrich the RB space, where we exploit band-limited functions to limit high frequencies and guarantee rapid convergence of the RB approximation.

A framework that combines direct measurements and computational modeling techniques is therefore an important analytical tool, able to extract various insights from the collected statistics and open new strategies for mitigation policies.    
Since pollutant dispersion depends on daily weather conditions, CFD models with low time scales, repeated evaluation, and fine mesh discretization must be used. The former requirements translate into huge memory requirements, making it essential to use HPC facilities. However, the problem is suitable for the employment of Reduced Order Models (ROMs) to achieve fast converged solutions with limited loss of accuracy.    
For this reason, the present work consists of the exploration of a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) coupled with the Galerkin projection approach for the acceleration of external environmental flow problems.    
The evolution of the pollutant is described through the transport equation, where the convective field is given by the solution to the RANS equations, while the source term consists of an empirical time series.  Here we propose a data-driven approach based on a POD-NN reconstruction of the flux field, which is used to recover in a non-intrusive fashion the reduced-order operators required for the online evaluation.    
Our framework is validated on different scales and using real traffic measurements.

Monte Carlo (MC) methods are a favorable algorithmic choice in these situations, given the inherent multi-dimensional and multi-physics nature of such phenomena. MC transport methods have traditionally used a history-based approach, where individual particle histories are tracked until census. With the recent computational shift to GPUs, an alternative "event-based" approach is becoming more attractive given their potential speedups compared to their history-based counterparts. In this talk, we present a CUDA implementation of an event-based MC method in the astrophysical radiative transfer code Sedona. Through a series of benchmark test problems, we examine the computational efficiency relative to a history-based CPU approach including strong and weak scaling measurements. We also demonstrate the drawbacks of event-based approaches for memory-bound situations that may appear in more realistic science production runs, and suggest potential workarounds in such cases.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75678' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(943)' class='star'><span class='star943'>&star;</span></a> Shilpa Khatri  <span id='bitlink-2759'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2759)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2759' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2759)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Close Evaluation of Layer Potentials</b><br />Shilpa Khatri<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-206.html'>Numerical Simulation of Bio-Inspired Fluid-Structure Interaction - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>To understand the fluid dynamics of complex phenomena, fluid-structure interaction problems must be solved.

Since both simulation methods incorporate thermal fluctuations, a correct coupling of the two methods through a computational interface requires careful stochastic analysis. In addition, the fact that the two methods are based on disparate types of descriptions (that is,  FHD is a continuum description whereas KMC is particle dynamics on a lattice) makes it a nontrivial task to develop a thermodynamically-consistent coupling between the two phases. By assuming that additional interactions between the two phases that are induced by the inclusion of surface chemistry occur only through adsorption and desorption processes, we develop a physically-inspired flux-exchange model where mass and energy fluxes across the interface are computed based on adsorption/desorption counts. By performing stochastic analysis, we justify the proposed mass and energy updates in FHD cells. We validate the overall hybrid simulation method by performing simulations for gas-solid interfaces undergoing reversible adsorption. We also discuss high-performance computing implementation strategies.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75498' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1898)' class='star'><span class='star1898'>&star;</span></a> Chansoo Kim  <span id='bitlink-2763'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2763)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2763' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2763)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Acceleration of Convergence of Fixed-Point Iterations</b><br />Chansoo Kim<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1353)' class='star'><span class='star1353'>&star;</span></a> Hwanwoo Kim  <span id='bitlink-2764'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2764)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2764' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2764)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hierarchical Ensemble Kalman Methods with Sparsity-Promoting Generalized Gamma Hyperpriors</b><br />Hwanwoo Kim<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-298.html'>Robust Uncertainty Quantification and Inference - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we introduce a computational framework to incorporate flexible regularization techniques in ensemble Kalman methods for nonlinear inverse problems.

The attractiveness of spectral methods has been  demonstrated by thousands of long and highly accurate binary black hole simulations.  Discontinuous Galerkin methods seek to provide the accuracy of spectral  methods while also robustly capturing shocks in hydrodynamics simulations.

While the classical Lanczos method has exponential cost in the system size to represent the Krylov states for quantum systems, our efficient quantum algorithm achieves this in polynomial time and memory. The construction presented is exact in the sense that the resulting Krylov space is identical to that of the Lanczos method, so the only approximation with respect to the Lanczos method is due to finite sample noise. This is possible because, unlike previous quantum versions of the Lanczos method, our algorithm does not require simulating real or imaginary time evolution. We provide an explicit error bound for the resulting ground state energy estimate in the presence of noise. For this method to be successful, the only requirement on the input problem is that the overlap of the initial state with the true ground state must be $\Omega(1/\text{poly}(n))$ for $n$ qubits.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75873' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1902)' class='star'><span class='star1902'>&star;</span></a> Mikhail Kirilin  <span id='bitlink-2770'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2770)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2770' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2770)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Added Technical Aspects of P4est: Alternative Quadrant Representation and MPI-3 Shared Memory</b><br />Mikhail Kirilin<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(207)' class='star'><span class='star207'>&star;</span></a> George Kissas  <span id='bitlink-2771'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2771)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2771' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2771)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Operator Learning in Vascular Flows Modeling: Online Biomarker Prediction and Uncertainty Quantification from Non-Invasive 4D Flow MRI Data</b><br />George Kissas<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-45.html'>Operator Learning in the Physical and Data Sciences - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Unlike diseases with strong genetic predisposition, such as cancer, there exist no accurate personalized diagnostic tools for disorders such as Hypertensive Pregnancy Disorders (HPD) and its mechanism remain understudied. For the purpose of performing diagnostics, we require disease indicators (biomarkers) that are strongly correlated with the underlying condition, i.e. absolute vascular pressure for hypertension. Measuring absolute pressure requires an invasive procedure and it is impossible for pregnant subjects, but an informed estimate is possible via the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics. Unfortunately, not only the computational cost of CFD is high, but also patient specific information required in modeling is missing in the clinic.    
The goal of this talk is to synthesize AI, CFD and medical imaging (US/MRI) techniques to provide trustworthy predictions of strong  biomarkers for early diagnosis of HPD in a real-time clinical setting.

However, the increasing availability of large amounts of datasets as well as the increasing available computational power of modern computers lead to a steady growth in the complexity and size of DNN and CNN models, respectively, and thus, to  longer training times. Hence, various methods and attempts have been developed to accelerate and parallelize the training of complex network architectures. In this talk, a novel domain decomposition-based CNN-DNN architecture  is presented which naturally supports a model parallel training strategy. Experimental results for different 2D image classification problems are shown as well as for a face recognition problem, and for a classification problem for 3D computer tomography (CT) scans.  The results show that the proposed approach can significantly accelerate the required training time compared to the global model and, additionally, can also help to improve the accuracy of the underlying classification problem.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75728' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(708)' class='star'><span class='star708'>&star;</span></a> Andreas Kleefeld  <span id='bitlink-2774'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2774)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2774' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2774)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Interior Transmission Eigenvalue Trajectories</b><br />Andreas Kleefeld<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-156.html'>Novel Methods for Inverse Scattering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>Properties of complex-valued eigenvalue trajectories for the interior transmission problem parametrized by a constant index of refraction are investigated.

Finally, a conjecture on the link between these two eigenvalue families is given.

This is manifested in a long list of well-known open-source frameworks and commercial services that provide Bayesian optimization solutions for HNAS problems.  However, despite its success, vanilla Bayesian optimization faces several challenges on popular HNAS use-cases: First, Bayesian optimization itself needs to become more robust and automated, to not open another hyperparameter optimization problem on top. Second, with the ever increasing computational demands of machine learning, we have to accelerate the optimization process as much as possible. Third, there is a growing interest to optimize more than just the validation performance, such as inference latency or model size.  In this talk, I will present an overview of our recent work that tries to overcome the current short-coming of Bayesian optimization. I argue that these are necessary steps towards fully automated machine learning systems that are able to learn truly end-to-end.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75229' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(991)' class='star'><span class='star991'>&star;</span></a> Pedro Costa Klein  <span id='bitlink-2777'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2777)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2777' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2777)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Paving the Way for Open and Reproducible Research Within the CRC 1456</b><br />Pedro Costa Klein<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-217.html'>Interfaces, Workflows, and Knowledge Graphs for FAIR CSE - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>We witness an era where unprecedented amounts of data are acquired in experimental research in the natural sciences. While new measurement techniques and instruments keep being devised and improved for inexpensive and efficient data acquisition, the current bottleneck is how to extract meaningful information from the resulting vast amounts of such measurements.  The DFG-funded Collaborative Research Center 1456 "Mathematics of Experiments" conducts research to improve mathematical tools for analyzing experimental data. In several subprojects between research groups from the natural sciences and mathematics, experiments and algorithms are developed, improved and analysed. Research activities in this field are very diverse which makes it challenging to define and ensure quality measures for good scientific practice in view of open research and reproducibility. In this talk, we present different actions undertaken as part of central efforts of the CRC's infrastructure project. This includes basic means such as infrastructure and training to ensure reproducibility, but also fostering scientific communication of research results through interactive documentations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75531' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1482)' class='star'><span class='star1482'>&star;</span></a> &#216;ystein Klemetsdal  <span id='bitlink-2778'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2778)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2778' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2778)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Nonlinear Domain Decomposition Preconditioning Strategies for Robust and Efficient Simulation of Field-Scale Subsurface Flow</b><br />&#216;ystein Klemetsdal<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-326.html'>Nonlinear Preconditioning</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>Macro-scale models of subsurface flow are usually simulated using implicit methods, which lead to large, stiff, and strongly coupled systems of discrete nonlinear equations. Newton-type methods work well as long as the coupling/nonlinearity is balanced in space, but may end up wasting a lot of computational effort when the dominant nonlinearity is localized. A better alternative is then to use a nonlinear domain-decomposition preconditioning strategy (e.g., ASPIN) that first resolves challenging nonlinearities in a local stage before accounting for long-range iterations in a global, Newton-like stage. This improves robustness to time-step sizes and initial guess but also introduces higher computational cost per global iteration compared with standard Newton. In this talk, we will discuss methods to hybridize the two approaches, so that standard Newton is used when this method converges well, with an adaptive switch to ASPIN when faced with severe local nonlinearities. We demonstrate the efficacy of the hybrid method on examples carefully designed to stress-test the nonlinear solver as well as on real, industrial simulation models.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75729' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(167)' class='star'><span class='star167'>&star;</span></a> Kerry Klemmer  <span id='bitlink-2779'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2779)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2779' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2779)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Leveraging Model Assumptions for Model Form Uncertainty Quantification</b><br />Kerry Klemmer<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-37.html'>Probabilistic Methods for Model-Form Uncertainty</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>Model-form uncertainty arises from physical assumptions made in constructing models either to reduce the physical complexity or to model physical processes that are not well understood. In Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling and turbulent combustion modeling, some of these assumptions are known and can be leveraged as a priori knowledge in quantifying the uncertainty. Three such approaches are presented in this talk that take advantage of the physics inherently neglected by a model in order to characterize the structural uncertainties and model-form error. The “peer models” approach compares the model output between two equally plausible models with divergent assumptions, such that model variability is indicative of model error. The “hierarchical models” approach identifies a hierarchy of models of increasing fidelity and functionalizes the error in a lower fidelity model based on the principles of a higher fidelity model. These first two approaches are applied to turbulent reacting flows, where the model-form error is propagated through Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using stochastic collocation. The final “implied models” approach analyzes the model error through the derivation of a transport equation for the model error that is implied by the model for the quantity of interest. The “implied models” approach is applied to RANS turbulence model for multiple turbulent flow configurations in order to better understand the sources of model-form error including the role of error cancellation and error superposition.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75253' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(391)' class='star'><span class='star391'>&star;</span></a> Christian F.

Instead they want to determine the uncertain coefficient in a PDE by measuring data of the experiment corresponding to the PDE. In other words experimentalists are interested in solving an inverse problem.    
To this end we shall have lectures on a range of mathematical techniques needed to approach this problem. Our underlying tenet is to approach the inherent illposedness of inverse problems for macroscopic PDEs by considering inverse problems for the corresponding kinetic equations. This is well illustrated by considering models from mathematical biology, namely the motion of cells, as described by the kinetic chemotaxis equations. The corresponding macroscopic Keller-Segel type model will be a diffusion equation. The aim is to study the inverse problems in these two settings. We will hear about numerical approaches that need to be devolped in this context.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75349' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1568)' class='star'><span class='star1568'>&star;</span></a> Jakub Klinkovsk&#253;  <span id='bitlink-2781'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2781)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2781' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2781)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Development and Optimization of a Coupled Multi-GPU LBM-MHFEM Solver for Vapor Transport in the Boundary Layer over a Moist Soil</b><br />Jakub Klinkovsk&#253;<br />Tuesday, February 28 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-345.html'>Recent Developments on GPU-Based Solvers in High-Performance Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>We present an efficient computational approach for simulating component transport within single-phase free flow over a soil layer. A numerical model based on this approach is validated using controlled experiments in a climate-controlled low-speed wind tunnel that is interfaced with a soil tank to study problems of heat and mass flux across the land-atmospheric interface.  The numerical model is based on a combination of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) formulated for a weakly compressible fluid flow and the mixed-hybrid finite element method (MHFEM) for solving constituent transport. Both of these methods individually, as well as when coupled, are implemented for execution entirely on a GPU accelerator in order to utilize its computational power and avoid the hardware limitations caused by slow communication between the GPU and CPU over the PCI-E bus. Furthermore, domain decomposition and optimization techniques are used to balance the load and communication costs when using multiple GPUs on an HPC cluster.    
We describe the numerical method and implementation of the solver, focusing primarily on the coupling mechanisms and performance optimizations. The performance of the solver is studied on Nvidia A-100 GPUs within the Karolina supercomputer managed by IT4Innovations, Czech Republic. Flow and transport simulation results are shown and compared with experimental data measured in the wind tunnel.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75757' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1975)' class='star'><span class='star1975'>&star;</span></a> Alicia M.

These plasmas can undergo magnetic reconnection, which converts the potential energy of the magnetic fields to particle kinetic energy. This mechanism is an important source of particle acceleration and heating in astrophysical plasmas. Using the particle-in-cell code WarpX, we perform large first-principles 2D simulations of relativistic reconnection plasmas representative of those found in these environments. These simulations produce particle energies and plasmoid structures in agreement with results previously reported in the literature. Using this robust baseline case, we compare the accuracy and computational performance of three methods of solving Maxwell’s equations, including the commonly-used second-order finite difference time domain (FDTD) method and the more advanced ultra-high-order pseudo-spectral analytical time domain (PSATD) method. This is the first time PSATD has been used in simulations of astrophysical reconnection. We find that for the reconnection problem, FDTD and PSATD are comparably accurate, but that time-to-solution with PSATD is half that of FDTD. These performance gains will make our 3D simulations of reconnection more tractable, and complement other efforts to improve simulation efficiency, such as the use of mesh refinement.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75678' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1807)' class='star'><span class='star1807'>&star;</span></a> Robert Kl&#246;fkorn  <span id='bitlink-2784'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2784)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2784' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2784)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Overview on Recent Development in Dune and Dune-Fem</b><br />Robert Kl&#246;fkorn<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-398.html'>Solving PDEs with DUNE-FEM</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small>For about two decades the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment  (DUNE:https://dune-project.org) has been an active part in the scientific  development of computational software and technology and it's C++ routines are the basis for several other well established open source projects, for example, DuMux (https://dumux.org) or the Open Porous Media Initiative  (https://opm-project.org).

They are well-suited to find low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional systems and are a powerful tool in the creation of surrogate models but require an expensive offline training-phase.     
In addition, simulation models often consist of many degrees of freedom due to the modeling approach, but not due to the underlying requirements. Hence, they possess a higher resolution than necessary which leads to computational ballast. Accordingly, we propose to decrease the level of detail of the problem first to enable an efficient offline phase and hyperparameter tuning during training of AEs. Hereafter, a higher-detail surrogate model is built which is only refined in areas where necessary. For this, we use transfer-learning approaches to take advantage of already learned information.    
In detail, we work on down-sampled finite element models using mesh simplification. On a very coarse mesh, the first surrogate model is created using a graph convolutional autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron to capture the model's parameter dependencies. Based on its approximation quality, some areas are refined by replacing up-sampling matrices with adaptive up-sampling networks.  We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach on high-dimensional static as well as dynamic problems and compare it to classic AE-based MOR.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75203' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(547)' class='star'><span class='star547'>&star;</span></a> Matthew G.

Finally, I will assess prospects for quantum control in reservoir engineering where the desired dissipation can be realized via quantum non-demolition measurements.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75324' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1784)' class='star'><span class='star1784'>&star;</span></a> Marcel Koch  <span id='bitlink-2791'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2791)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2791' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2791)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adapting Exascale Techniques Through Ginkgo</b><br />Marcel Koch<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-392.html'>Exascale Applications of High-Order PDE Solvers - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>This talk presents modern, exascale-ready techniques within the Ginkgo high-performance linear algebra library, focused on manycore systems.

The Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM), a global model with an icosahedral grid system, has been developed and used for two decades. The first grand challenge simulation of NICAM was global cloud-resolving (here, 3.5 km mesh) simulation around 2005, and its extension toward climate scale is now in sight with Fugaku. The value of such climate simulation is guaranteed by a series of recent model improvements to better simulate both mean state and disturbances. We are also revealing the climatological performance of the ocean-coupled version of NICAM through a series of seasonal to decadal simulations. Another important challenge is an O($10^3$) ensemble global prediction experiment with 14 km mesh for better forecast of tropical cyclones over a week. As a resolution-intensive approach, we are trying to run NICAM with a mesh size of 200 m globally to open an era of global large-eddy simulation. The above challenges on Fugaku would be harder without an effective co-design activity with the application developers. In terms of post-processing, we recently modified our MPI-based remapping tool and confirm its applicability to a global 870 m mesh data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75467' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(254)' class='star'><span class='star254'>&star;</span></a> Julian Koellermeier  <span id='bitlink-2794'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2794)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2794' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2794)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Model Reduction Using Moment Models</b><br />Julian Koellermeier<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-56.html'>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>The high dimensionality of many mathematical models in science and engineering leads to prohibitively large computational cost for even an approximate numerical solution. However, an accurate solution of the full model is often not even necessary, as only a small set of variables suffices to characterize the main behavior of the solution. This poses the question of model reduction: How can we efficiently reduce the complexity of the model and arrive at a reduced model, that is both sufficiently accurate and computationally feasible?     
In this talk, we fist briefly discuss different model reduction techniques for kinetic equations. We then focus on moment models as one way to reduce the full model to a set of analytical, lower dimensional equations. The benefits of moment models are the mathematically sound derivation, their hierarchical structure, and the possibility to assess analytical properties of the model from the resulting equations.   We consider, among others, examples from rarefied gases and free-surface flows and illustrate those by numerical simulations.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75290' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(149)' class='star'><span class='star149'>&star;</span></a> Lyndon Koens  <span id='bitlink-2795'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2795)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2795' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2795)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tubular-Body Theory</b><br />Lyndon Koens<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-33.html'>Computational Methods and Analysis for Biological Applications in Stokes Flow - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Cable-like bodies play a key role in many biological fluid systems but are hard to simulate. Asymptotic theories, called slender-body theories, are effective but apply in specific regimes and can be hard to extend beyond leading order. In this presentation I will develop an exact slender-body-like theory for the surface traction of cable like bodies in viscous flow. This theory expresses the traction as a series of solutions to a well behaved one-dimensional Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. This process can be simply generalised to other systems. We test this theory against known solutions and then use it to look at the swimming of a tightly wound helix exposed to an external torque.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75249' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(242)' class='star'><span class='star242'>&star;</span></a> Tobias Koeppl  <span id='bitlink-2796'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2796)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2796' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2796)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Calibration of Model Parameters for 1D-0D Coupled Blood Flow Models</b><br />Tobias Koeppl<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-53.html'>Computational Modeling of Coupled Multiscale Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we present a model for simulating blood flow within the largest arteries branching out of the heart. In order to decrease the computational effort one-dimensional (1D) Navier-Stokes equations are used to describe the flow field within this network. Since only large arteries are modeled by means of the 1D Navier-Stokes equations appropriate boundary conditions have to be imposed at the outlets of the considered network. One way to account for the missing vessels is to use systems of ordinary differential equations incorporating the resistance and capacity of the omitted vessels. Since they exhibit no space variable they are indicated as 0D models. All in all, this results in a 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. Parameters of the 0D models have to be chosen in a careful way to produce realistic simulation data. Using measurements of blood pressure curves, these parameters are calibrated formulating appropriate minimization problems. To avoid expensive evaluations of the respective cost functionals, physics informed neural networks are considered. For the solution of the minimization problems, we apply two different types of approaches: The first one is a classical gradient based method, while the second one uses features of quantum computers. In case of the second approach, we outline how data are transferred from a classical to a quantum computer and discuss new algorithmic aspects. The performance of both algorithms is illustrated by several numerical tests.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75279' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1811)' class='star'><span class='star1811'>&star;</span></a> Tzanio V.

These architectures favor algorithms that expose ultra fine-grain parallelism and maximize the ratio of floating point operations to energy intensive data movement. One of the few viable approaches to achieve high efficiency in the area of PDE discretizations on unstructured grids is to use matrix-free / partially-assembled high-order finite element methods, since these methods can increase the accuracy and/or lower the computational time due to reduced data motion. In this paper we provide an overview of the research and development activities in the Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED), a co-design center in the Exascale Computing Project that is focused on the development of next- generation discretization software and algorithms to enable a wide range of finite element applications to run efficiently on future hardware. CEED is a research partnership involving more than 30 computational scientists from two US national labs and five universities, including members of the Nek5000, MFEM, MAGMA and PETSc projects.

Recently, a connection between linear Gaussian Bayesian inference problems and the system theoretic concept of balanced truncation was drawn for the first time. Although this connection is new, the application of balanced truncation to data assimilation is not a novel concept: It has already been used in four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) in its discrete formulation. In our work, the link between system theory and data assimilation is further strengthened by discussing the application of balanced truncation to standard linear Gaussian Bayesian inference, and, in particular, the 4D-Var method. Similarities between both data assimilation problems allow a discussion of established methods as well as a generalisation of the state-of-the-art approach to arbitrary prior covariances as reachability Gramians. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced approach that allows to balance Bayesian inference for unstable systems and improves the numerical results for short observation periods.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75692' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1052)' class='star'><span class='star1052'>&star;</span></a> Julia Konrad  <span id='bitlink-2800'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2800)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2800' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2800)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Exploring Context-Aware Learning of Low-Fidelity Models for Multi-Fidelity Monte Carlo Sampling in Plasma Micro-Turbulence Analysis</b><br />Julia Konrad<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-230.html'>Accelerating Computational Science and Engineering via Data-Driven Learning and Nonlinear Model Reduction - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>Multi-fidelity Monte Carlo methods leverage hierarchies of high- and low-fidelity models for speeding up the computation of quantities of interest depending on high-fidelity models. However, the low-fidelity models are assumed to be fixed and therefore cannot be refined or improved, which is relevant, e.g, for data-driven models. To this end, the context-aware multi-fidelity Monte Carlo algorithm optimally balances the costs of training low-fidelity models with the sampling costs, which means that it takes into account the context in which the low-fidelity models will be used, i.e., for variance reduction in Monte Carlo estimation. In the original formulation of the algorithm, all low-fidelity models depend on all uncertain inputs. In this work, we use the fact that in many applications only a subset of the inputs is important for the underlying problem, and explore the potential of reduced-dimension low-fidelity models for speeding up computations further. With sensitivity information obtained from a first fully-dimensional context-aware low-fidelity model, we also construct reduced-dimension context-aware low-fidelity models, which only depend on subsets of selected, important uncertain inputs.  We explore this idea in the highly relevant context of quantifying uncertainty in small-scale fluctuations in confined fusion plasmas, which is a problem typically characterized by a large number of uncertain inputs and is therefore challenging to address with conventional methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75552' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(202)' class='star'><span class='star202'>&star;</span></a> Katiana Kontolati  <span id='bitlink-2801'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2801)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2801' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2801)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Transfer and Multi-Task Learning in Physics-Based Applications with Deep Neural Operators</b><br />Katiana Kontolati<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-44.html'>Operator Learning in the Physical and Data Sciences - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Traditional machine learning algorithms are learned in isolation, i.e., a predictive model is trained for a single task. In cases where multiple tasks are considered, this learning approach can be computationally prohibitive. Furthermore, when only few and insufficient labeled data are available for a given task, training a model from scratch might lead to overfitting. Transfer learning allows us to leverage information from a model trained on a source domain with sufficient labeled data and transfer it to a different but closely related target domain for which only a small number of data is available. We propose a new TL framework for task-specific learning of partial differential equations (PDEs) under multiple domains that are heterogeneous but subtly correlated, based on the deep operator network (DeepONet). After the training of a source operator regression model, additional given tasks are learned via the fine-tuning of task-specific layers based on a hybrid loss function that allows for the matching of individual target samples while also preserving the global properties of the conditional distribution of target data. The task-specific training is based on the conditional embedding operator theory where conditional target distributions are embedded onto a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for various TL scenarios involving nonlinear PDEs under diverse conditions due to shift in the geometric domain and model dynamics.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75264' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1472)' class='star'><span class='star1472'>&star;</span></a> Alena Kopanicakova  <span id='bitlink-2802'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2802)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2802' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2802)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards Large-Scale Training of Deep Neural Networks Using Domain-Decomposition Methods</b><br />Alena Kopanicakova<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-324.html'>On the Mutual Benefit of  Machine Learning and Domain Decomposition/Multilevel Methods - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are routinely used in a wide range of application areas and scientific fields, as they allow to efficiently predict the behavior of complex systems. However, before the DNNs can be effectively used for the prediction, their parameters have to be determined during the training process. Traditionally, the training process is associated with the minimization of a loss function, which is commonly performed using variants of the stochastic gradient (SGD) method. Although SGD and its variants have a low computational cost per iteration, their convergence properties tend to deteriorate with increasing network size. In this talk, we aim to alleviate the training cost of DNNs by leveraging the nonlinear domain decomposition strategies. The subdomains will be constructed by exploiting two complementary approaches, namely the decomposition of the data and the parameter space. This will give rise to two new classes of training methods, convergence properties of which will be analyzed using a series of numerical experiments. Comparison with state-of-the-art optimizers will be also performed, demonstrating the efficiency of our novel training methods. Moreover, we will discuss our parallelization strategy, its shortcomings, and possible future directions.

The growing amount of research data challenges an old requirement in science: its reproducibility and the re-usability of results. In an attempt to answer this challenge at current level, the FAIR principles have been formulated. Yet, despite the existence of special solutions a comprehensive infrastructure for research data that supports the research process and implements the FAIR principles in science or in mathematics is missing. In 2020 Germany started the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) which will be created along the needs of all scientific disciplines and aims at FAIR use of research data. Within the NFDI the Mathematical Research Data Initiative (MaRDI) is the consortium for developing a research data infrastructure for mathematics. Starting with the areas of computer algebra, scientific computing, statistics and machine learning, MaRDI will develop standards for confirmable workflows and certifiable mathematical results and provide new services that assist the research cycle up to peer-review in the publication process. Standardized formats, data interoperability and application programming interfaces need to be established to ensure the ease of use of data across broad disciplines.

This kinetic description of a plasma is computationally very challenging due to the dimensionality of the phase space.   Low-rank solutions to the Vlasov-Maxwell equations have the potential to  compress the distribution function which enables a fast and accurate   solution. However, most simulations so far have been for relatively simple test cases which exhibit a strong low-rank structure.  Parallelizing low-rank solvers on a large scale is hard which hampers the applicability in state-of-the-art physics simulations. In joint work with Allmann-Rahn and Grauer, we have recently shown that more complex test cases can be tackled with a compression that is only confined to the velocity space. Another way of exploiting low-rank solutions in large-scale simulations    is to use a hybrid simulation that combines a low-rank solution with a particle-in-cell simulation. In this talk, we consider a particle-in-cell simulation with   a low-rank solution as a dynamic control variate. For benchmark test cases, it is shown that the low-rank control variate---in contrast to a time-independent   control variate---continues to improve on the accuracy of the particle solution when nonlinear effects become dominant.

A typical example of such a situation is a contact between two bodies with concentrated stress under the contact region, which requires a more accurate simulation than in the rest of the domain. Similarly, in flow simulations we often deal with geometries with narrow passages or other geometric complications for which a more refined solution is desired. In fact, most real-world problems we wish to simulate exhibit such behaviour at some point. This can be addressed with two conceptually different adaptive approaches, namely p-adaptivity or h-/r-adaptivity. In p-adaptivity, the solution accuracy is varied by changing the order of approximation, while in h-/r-adaptivity the resolution of the spatial discretisation is adjusted for the same purpose. Ultimately, h- and p-adaptivities can be combined into hp-adaptivity for maximum performance. Since the regions where higher accuracy is required are usually not known a priori, and to avoid human intervention in the solution procedure, a measure of the quality of the solution, commonly referred to as an a posteriori error indicator, is a necessary additional step in an adaptive solution procedure. In this talk we will present our work on the hp-adaptive RBF-FD method for solving problems from linear elasticity and fluid flow.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75784' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1810)' class='star'><span class='star1810'>&star;</span></a> Niklas Kotarsky  <span id='bitlink-2806'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2806)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2806' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2806)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Time Adaptive Quasi-Newton Waveform Iteration</b><br />Niklas Kotarsky<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-398.html'>Solving PDEs with DUNE-FEM</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75877' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1903)' class='star'><span class='star1903'>&star;</span></a> Niklas Kotarsky  <span id='bitlink-2807'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2807)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2807' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2807)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Time Adaptive Quasi-Newton Waveform Iteration</b><br />Niklas Kotarsky<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1481)' class='star'><span class='star1481'>&star;</span></a> Hardik Kothari  <span id='bitlink-2808'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2808)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2808' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2808)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Nonlinear Preconditioning Strategy for Solving Phase-Field Fracture Problems</b><br />Hardik Kothari<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-326.html'>Nonlinear Preconditioning</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>One of the state-of-the-art methodologies to model crack propagation is the phase-field approach.  In this approach, a new variable called phase-field is introduced which characterizes the state of the material from intact to fully broken.  Modeling such problems is computationally challenging due to the highly nonlinear, non-convex, and non-smooth nature of the underlying energy function.  In this work, we aim to solve such problems, from the perspective of the optimization methods.  We propose to solve the arising nonlinear problems efficiently using the domain decomposition methods.  For the domain decomposition approach, we take advantage of the field-split method to decouple the problem into two sets that are related to the displacement and the damage variable.  This spit allows us to take advantage of the additive and multiplicative variants of the Schwarz preconditioned inexact Newton (ASPIN/MSPIN) method to solve the nonlinear system.  In this work, we will demonstrate the convergence behavior of the proposed solution strategies using several benchmark problems, and also discuss an approach to handle the variational inequalities.  We will also compare these methods with the widely-used alternate minimization method and show the benefits of our solution schemes.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75729' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(763)' class='star'><span class='star763'>&star;</span></a> Christian K&#246;the  <span id='bitlink-2809'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2809)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2809' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2809)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Space-Time Finite Element Methods for Electric Machines</b><br />Christian K&#246;the<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-167.html'>Computational Methods for Electric Machines - Part II of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>For the numerical solution of parabolic evolution equations we consider   a space-time least squares formulation in appropriate function spaces which results in a mixed finite element scheme.

We prove global convergence of our method in Hilbert space and analyze the worst-case complexity to reach a prescribed tolerance.  Our method employs the proximal mapping of the nonsmooth objective function and is simple to implement. Moreover, when using a quadratic Taylor model, our algorithm represents a matrix-free proximal Newton-type method that permits indefinite Hessians.  We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on various examples from data-science and PDE-constrained optimization.

While several data-driven strategies for the construction of inexpensive surrogates have been proposed, their majority is hampered by the following difficulties:    
 -  they rely on a large, training dataset of input-output pairs which in turn  implies a significant computational cost.   -  the inputs for which training data is generated are decided a priori without regard to their informational content in constructing the surrogate.   -  deterministic surrogates are mostly considered which cannot quantify predictive uncertainty, especially in out-of-distribution settings.    
We propose a fully probabilistic approach in which the governing PDE is treated as a source of virtual data which is inquired iteratively by considering appropriate weighted residuals. We formulate this as a Variational Inference optimization objective, the output of which is a fine-tuned, probabilistic surrogate. We  consider several variations of the main strategy and demonstrate its efficacy in a variety of problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75855' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2072)' class='star'><span class='star2072'>&star;</span></a> P&#233;ter Kov&#225;cs  <span id='bitlink-2813'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2813)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2813' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2813)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fusing Model- and Deep Learning-Based Methods for Thermographic Imaging</b><br />P&#233;ter Kov&#225;cs<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-138.html'>EU-MATHS-IN: Success Stories of Mathematical Technologies in Societal Challenges and Industry, Part I</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques offer tools to inspect material parts without causing damage. Thermographic imaging is a specific NDE approach in which the investigated object is heated up by induction, flashlamps, or lasers. After an initial thermal excitation, the surface temperature can be measured with infrared cameras. Inside the object, the temperature evolution in time can be described by the heat diffusion equation conditioned by the measured surface temperature. In NDE applications, we are interested in the reconstruction of the initial temperature profile, since it infers the internal structure of the inspected material. Mathematically, this can be formulated as a large-scale linear inverse problem which is highly ill-posed.     
In this talk, we propose a hybrid approach for thermographic imaging in which we combine numerical regularization with deep learning to improve the reconstruction accuracy. This framework provides new alternatives to extract features with physical interpretation and to incorporate domain knowledge, such as smoothness, non-negativity and sparsity,  automatically during the reconstruction procedure. As a case study, applications in NDE material testing will be considered starting with 2D problems towards thermal tomography in 3D.

In contrast to Bayesian inverse problems governed by linear parameter-to-observable maps, a closed-form expression for the optimality criterion is typically not available for nonlinear inverse problems because the posterior distribution is generally non-Gaussian. Common approaches for dealing with this challenge rely on: (i) reformulation or approximation of the optimality criterion via linearization of the problem, or, (ii) sampling-based Monte Carlo estimates of the expected utility.     
We follow the latter approach and focus on designs maximizing the expected information gain from prior to posterior, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Using transport maps, we present a computationally tractable approach for finding optimal designs for Bayesian inverse problems governed by nonlinear parameter-to-observable maps. More precisely, we approximate the joint density of the design, observable, and parameter random variables as the pushforward of a reference probability density, allowing real-time sampling from the (approximate) posterior distribution for any realization of data and design. Additionally, we touch upon possible extensions of our method to sequential optimal experimental design.

Small size requirements come in pair with increasing demands on electrical properties, which makes high-frequency design challenging, as reducing physical dimensions is detrimental to performance. Miniaturization-oriented parametric optimization is a heavily  constrained task, which is also multimodal due to a parameter redundancy associated with topological modifications introduced in compact structures. Identification of truly minimum-size designs can only be realized through global search. Utilization of nature-inspired algorithms is impractical due to their poor computational efficiency as well as the fact that reliable evaluation of electrical characteristics requires full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation. Here, we introduce a machine learning procedure for low-cost global optimization-based size reduction of high-frequency structures. Our methodology involves a parameter space pre-screening, and kriging surrogate models iteratively refined using minimization of the predicted objective function as an infill criterion. Numerical experiments conducted using a number of antenna and microwave structures indicate that the proposed framework is capable of yielding consistent results for multiple algorithm runs, as well as achieving competitive miniaturization rates at low computational cost, as compared to the benchmark.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75699' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(796)' class='star'><span class='star796'>&star;</span></a> Boris Kramer  <span id='bitlink-2816'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2816)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2816' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2816)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Shifted Operator Inference Method for Learning Solar Wind Models</b><br />Boris Kramer<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-174.html'>System-Theoretic Learning Methods and Model Reduction - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>Solar wind conditions are predominantly predicted via three-dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Despite their ability to produce highly accurate predictions, MHD models require computationally intensive high-dimensional simulations. This renders them inadequate for making time-sensitive predictions and for large-ensemble analysis required in uncertainty quantification. This paper presents a new data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) capability for forecasting heliospheric solar wind speeds. Traditional model reduction methods based on Galerkin projection have difficulties with advection-dominated systems---such as solar winds---since they require a large number of basis functions and can become unstable. A core contribution of this work addresses this challenge by extending the non-intrusive operator inference ROM framework to exploit the translational symmetries present in the solar wind caused by the Sun's rotation. The numerical results show that our method can adequately emulate the MHD simulations and outperforms a reduced-physics surrogate model, the Heliospheric Upwind Extrapolation model.

There are many benefits of using a boundary integral method such as this one to numerically solve Stokes equations. An advantage is that the dimensionality is reduced by one as the partial differential equation is rewritten into a boundary integral equation that must only be solved over the boundary of the domain in order to determine a so-called layer density. As a post-processing step, different quantities of the flow can be found via integrals of the layer density, which become difficult to accurately compute when evaluated at or close to the boundary of the domain due to the Green’s function in the integrand. Periodic problems are also considered, where so-called Ewald decompositions of the aforementioned quantities are derived to allow for rapid evaluation of the arising sums using FFTs.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75805' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(780)' class='star'><span class='star780'>&star;</span></a> Dieter Kranzlmueller  <span id='bitlink-2818'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2818)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2818' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2818)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Environmental Energy-Aware Computing applied High Throughput Applications</b><br />Dieter Kranzlmueller<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-170.html'>A Roadmap to Robust Science for High-throughput Applications: Use Cases and Lessons Learned</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Environmental research comes in many different flavors and on a variety of topics.

That is their dynamical equations can be obtained from an action principle or a Poisson bracket and a Hamiltonian functional, typically the total energy of the system.  Non-conservative problems are usually composed of a conservative (Lagrangian or Hamiltonian) and a dissipative part.  In both cases, it is important to preserve the structure of the conservative part in the course of discretisation in order to obtain stable numerical schemes that deliver accurate and reliable simulation results.    
We discuss Hamiltonian structure-preserving discretisation approaches based on high-order Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Methods (DGSEM). We show how these approaches relate to and generalise known energy-stable schemes based on split-forms and summation-by-parts properties.  The inviscid Burgers equation and the compressible Euler equations serve as main examples. Generalisations to other important fluid and plasma systems are sketched.    
A remarkable property of the proposed approach is that exact mass, momentum and energy conservation can be achieved even if the system of equations is not cast in conservative form and momentum and energy do not explicitly appear as variables.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75455' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(668)' class='star'><span class='star668'>&star;</span></a> Rolf Krause  <span id='bitlink-2820'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2820)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2820' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2820)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Enhancing Training of Scientific Machine Learning Applications</b><br />Rolf Krause<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-147.html'>Scientific Machine Learning and Data-Driven Techniques in Complex Multi-Physics Systems  - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Scientific machine learning  (SCL) approaches employ supervised and unsupervised deep learning techniques in order to model the dynamics of complex multiscale and multiphysics problems, and are designed to provide exceptionally cheap surrogates. Despite their performance during model evaluation, SCL approaches suffer from a computationally exhaustive training phase.     
In this talk, we will leverage ideas from multilevel minimization methods to efficiently train deep neural networks (DNNs) employed in SCL applications. The main idea behind multilevel methods is to employ a hierarchy of auxiliary problems, which are minimized internally to accelerate the solution process of the original problem. We will discuss how to construct a multilevel hierarchy and transfer operators by exploring the properties of the loss function and the structure of the DNN architecture.     
The convergence properties of our novel training method will be analyzed using a series of numerical experiments, including physics-informed neural networks, and deep operator learning approaches. A comparison with the stochastic gradient and Adam optimizers will be also presented, showing a significant reduction in terms of the computational cost for the training phase.

Sometimes we use well developed solvers like LP or  SAT. And sometimes we develop specialized algorithms, as general  solvers may have drawbacks like speed or robustness. In the course of  developing such algorithms graphs and graph theoretical approach  appear more and more often.    
In some cases graph emerge naturally as obvious models. In some  chemical related problems the chemical structure represented by graph  structure. Distances measured and clusters searched in network models  for roads, social interactions or chemical interactions in complex  systems as our body.    
In other cases graphs used as a modeling language alike numbers, and  thus graph models could represent hidden relationships far from  obvious. For analysis of the stock market the market graph is build  from pairwise temporal correlation of stock price.   Auxiliary graphs can represent scheduling problems,  protein docking sites and many more.    
In this talk we will review the state of the art methodologies in the  above sense with a special focus on algorithmic  complexity. Concentrating on hard problems we will highlight the  modeling expressivity as well as the efficiency of different  algorithmic engineering approaches. We will also outline the potential  approaches for future research trends.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75715' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(267)' class='star'><span class='star267'>&star;</span></a> Remo Kretschmann  <span id='bitlink-2827'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2827)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2827' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2827)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimal Regularized Hypothesis Testing in Statistical Inverse Problems</b><br />Remo Kretschmann<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-59.html'>Computational Methods for Statistical Inverse Problems</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>In many inverse problems, one is not primarily interested in the whole solution $u^\dagger \in \mathcal{X}$, but in specific features of it that can be described by a family of linear functionals of $u^\dagger$. We perform statistical inference for such features by means of hypothesis testing.    
This problem has recently been treated by multiscale methods based upon unbiased estimates of those functionals. Constructing hypothesis tests using unbiased estimators, however, has two severe drawbacks: Firstly, unbiased estimators only exist for sufficiently smooth linear functionals, and secondly, they suffer from a huge variance due to the ill-posedness of the problem, so that the corresponding tests have bad detection properties.    
We overcome both of these issues by considering hypothesis tests with maximal power among all tests based upon linear estimators that have a given level of significance. While the construction of such optimal tests requires knowledge of the true solution $u^\dagger$, we present a way to compute approximately optimal hypothesis tests adaptively. We study this approach both analytically and numerically for linear inverse problems and compare it with unregularized hypothesis testing.

The core algorithm is the matrix-free evaluation of the discretized partial discretization, computing the cell and face integrals of high order continuous and discontinuous finite elements on general curved meshes on the fly with sum-factorization techniques. I will contrast the algorithm selection for achieving a high throughput on GPUs and CPUs, with a focus on the latter in terms of SIMD vectorization and cache behavior. As modern implementations involve an arithmetic intensity of one to five Flop/byte, the most pressing limit is the memory bandwidth. I will present available options to reduce the memory access and increase data locality, such as computation of metric terms on the fly and the fusion of vector operations into the operator evaluation. The performance will be assessed in the context of multigrid algorithms with point-Jacobi and fast-diagonalization smoothers as well as iterative solvers with simple preconditions.

In this talk, we consider the specific parallel-in-time algorithms of multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT) and Parareal. We discuss recent advances we have made in solving linear hyperbolic PDEs with these methods. This includes improved theoretical understanding of the difficulties that arise when applying these methods to hyperbolic PDEs, and new and improved coarse-grid operators that use semi-Lagrangian discretization techniques.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75635' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1979)' class='star'><span class='star1979'>&star;</span></a> Anna Kucherova  <span id='bitlink-2832'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2832)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2832' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2832)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Computational Modelling of Protein Conformational Changes - Application to the Opening Sars-CoV-2 Spike</b><br />Anna Kucherova<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-408.html'>Using CSE to Understand COVID and Other Infectious Diseases</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>We present a new approach to compute and analyze the dynamical electro-geometric properties of proteins undergoing conformational changes.

We introduce novel a posteriori error estimates to quantify the solution's accuracy on the molecular surface. To illustrate the approach, we consider the opening of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the recent molecular trajectory simulated through the Folding@home initiative.

The interface is typically a manifold of co-dimension 1 or 2 with the latter being the case in reduced-order models. The mixed-dimensional nature of the models, the coupling between the subsystems and the large ranges of physical parameters found in the applications of interest present a challenge for designing efficient numerical schemes.  In this talk, we develop monolithic preconditioners leading to order optimal and parameter robust solvers for coupled multiphysics models where the coupling is realized through a dedicated Lagrange multiplier on the interface as well as for the formulations where it is enforced weakly. A crucial component in the analysis is correctly posing the interface conditions between the subsystems. In particular, we show that robust preconditioning requires weighted fractional order Sobolev spaces and their intersections. The performance of the preconditioners will be illustrated in biomedical applications in cardiac and brain mechanics.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75747' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1509)' class='star'><span class='star1509'>&star;</span></a> Sebastian Kuckuk  <span id='bitlink-2834'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2834)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2834' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2834)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Code Generation for the Simulation of Ocean Flows on Block-Structured Grids</b><br />Sebastian Kuckuk<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-332.html'>Stencil Computation for Scientific Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>Stencil computations and their application in various scientific domains have been an active field of research for the past decades.  We present our work on utilizing stencil technologies in complex application scenarios transcending simple benchmark problems.  One such domain is the simulation of ocean flows which requires support for real-world geometries, advanced numerical components, as well as domain-specific boundary conditions and source terms.    
Based on an early code version, we first transition from uniform to block-structured grids.  They are set up automatically by coarsely meshing a given geometry before applying multiple refinement steps and nodal position optimization.  Next, we extend for higher-order quadrature-free discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations.  The resulting compute kernels are more complex than traditional stencil codes but share beneficial characteristics such as vectorizability, consecutive memory accesses, and suitability for GPUs.    
To tackle performance portability and the high number of possible implementation variants, we employ code generation techniques.  The ExaStencils framework serves as an excellent base as it is capable of automatically optimizing stencil-like codes, as well as of parallelizing them with MPI, OpenMP and CUDA.  Its Python-based front end GHODDESS adds the necessary support for DG discretizations, and further increases performance through domain-specific optimizations on the algorithmic level.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75737' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1623)' class='star'><span class='star1623'>&star;</span></a> Navjot Kukreja  <span id='bitlink-2835'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2835)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2835' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2835)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Revolve and Its Extensions</b><br />Navjot Kukreja<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-359.html'>Alleviating the Memory Footprint of Backpropagation</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75787' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(338)' class='star'><span class='star338'>&star;</span></a> Kaushik Kulkarni  <span id='bitlink-2836'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2836)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2836' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2836)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Transforming (not Just) DG-FEM Array Expressions (not Just) on GPUs</b><br />Kaushik Kulkarni<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-74.html'>PDE Simulations with High-Productivity Languages at the Dawn of Exascale - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>While domain-specific languages for finite-element-based PDE solvers have enjoyed considerable success, composing them with supporting computations (e.g. chemistry, neural networks, non-variational discretization schemes) has proved challenging.    
We solve this by developing a lazy-evaluation based array package (“Pytato”) with numpy-like semantics that also serves as an Intermediate Representation (IR) for operations on multi-dimensional arrays. In our framework, we lower the Pytato IR to an imperative, scalar, polyhedrally-based IR, based on our “Loopy” tool for loop transformations. Using these IRs we developed a transformation strategy that delivers near-roofline performance for a class of array computation graphs that have the same memory access pattern as that of chained Einstein summation expressions. We claim that the most-common DG-FEM operators have a similar computation structure and support it by applying the transformation to a range of operators seen in real world applications from Combution Physics, Wave Mechanics and Electrodynamics.    
We end by showing the relative-roofline performance metrics for a suite of DG-FEM operators and also show a comparison with off-the-shelf array packages and hand-tuned DG-FEM libraries.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75323' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(969)' class='star'><span class='star969'>&star;</span></a> Sunita Kumawat  <span id='bitlink-2837'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2837)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2837' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2837)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Elastodynamic Response of Sh Wave Dispersion in a Multi-Layered Concentric Cylinders Composed of Reinforced and Piezo-Materials</b><br />Sunita Kumawat<br />Monday, February 27 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-211.html'>Computational Challenges in Wave Theory: Methods and Applications - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>The present study fundamentally focuses on analyzing the limitations and transference of horizontally polarized Shear waves in a four-layered compounded cylinder. It comprises of concentric cylinders of infinite length composed of self-reinforced, fibre-reinforced, piezo-magnetic, and piezo-electric materials. The entire structure is assumed to be pre-stressed along the azimuthal direction. In order to make the structure sensitive to the application pertaining to sensors and actuators, the PM and PE cylinders have been categorically placed in the outer part of the geometry. Whereas in order to provide stiffness and stability to the structure, the inner part consists of self-reinforced and fibre- reinforced media. The common boundary between each of the cylinders has been essentially considered as imperfectly bounded. At the interface of PE and PM media, mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and inter-coupled types of imperfections have been exhibited. The closed-form of dispersion relation has been deduced for two contrast cases i.e. EOMS and ESMO circuit conditions. Dispersion curves have been plotted to illustrate the salient features of parameters like normalized imperfect interface parameters, initial stresses, and radii of the concentric cylinders. Graphs have been plotted to compare the effects of these parameters using two consecutive modes. This theoretical study may be implemented to improvise the performance of surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors and actuators.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75522' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(736)' class='star'><span class='star736'>&star;</span></a> Vyacheslav Kungurtsev  <span id='bitlink-2838'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2838)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2838' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2838)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Retraction Based Direct Search Methods for Derivative Free Riemannian Optimization</b><br />Vyacheslav Kungurtsev<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-64.html'>Theory and Applications of Derivative-Free Optimization - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75457' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(839)' class='star'><span class='star839'>&star;</span></a> Alexander Kurganov  <span id='bitlink-2839'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2839)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2839' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2839)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Central-Upwind Schemes with Reduced Numerical Dissipation</b><br />Alexander Kurganov<br />Friday, March 3 10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-183.html'>High Order Numerical Methods for Hyperbolic PDEs and Multiphysics Phenomena</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>Godunov-type central-upwind schemes are quite popular tools as they can be applied as &#8220;black-box' solvers for a wide variety of hyperbolic systems of conservation and balance laws.

I will introduce two new ways of reducing the amount of numerical dissipation present in central-upwind schemes. Both approaches lead to significant enhancement of the resolution, especially in the areas of contact waves, which are typically heavily affected by excessive numerical diffusion.    
The new schemes are implemented in the second-order finite-volume and fifth-order finite difference frameworks and applied to one- and two-dimensional compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics in both single- and multi-fluid cases.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75485' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1259)' class='star'><span class='star1259'>&star;</span></a> Marius Kurz  <span id='bitlink-2840'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2840)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2840' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2840)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reinforcement Learning for Discretization-Aware LES Models</b><br />Marius Kurz<br />Tuesday, February 28 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-276.html'>Machine Learning for Large-Scale Scientific Data Analysis and Model Simulations - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Over the past few years, increasing efforts have been devoted to leveraging the recent advances in machine learning for the field of turbulence modeling. Most approaches in this field were based on Supervised Learning, for which artificial neural networks (ANN) are trained by means of a precomputed training dataset. However, for large eddy simulations (LES), this approach can cause instabilities in practical simulations, since the dynamics of the discretized equations are not captured by the training process. An approach which avoids this pitfall is the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm, which, in contrast to Supervised Learning, trains ANN by interacting directly with the discretized dynamical system.  We demonstrate how the RL paradigm can be applied for turbulence modeling by presenting the novel RL framework Relexi, which couples flow solvers with the machine learning library TensorFlow, while leveraging modern high-performance computing resources. Relexi is applied to canonical flows, for which ANN are trained to adapt the coefficients of analytical LES models dynamically in space and time. We show that these data-driven LES models provide stable simulations, while outperforming traditional LES models in terms of accuracy. Thus, the proposed framework can provide a novel class of discretization-aware LES models, which can incorporate complex LES filter formulations and discretization effects by design.

An emerging tool to efficiently reduce computational costs and memory footprint in such settings is dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), which evolves the solution on a low-rank manifold. Since this manifold can exhibit a high curvature, time integrators for DLRA need to be carefully constructed to guarantee a robust error bound while preserving crucial properties of the original problem.    
This talk discusses a novel rank-adaptive and fully parallel DLRA time integrator. The integrator shares the robust error bound of the projector--splitting and the unconventional integrator while allowing basis functions and coefficients to be updated in parallel. Moreover, it allows for rank adaptivity while not requiring the potentially expensive augmented Galerkin step of the rank-adaptive unconventional integrator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrator for various radiation transport problems including radiation therapy.

This is based on the series of works for solving differential equations for applications in fluid dynamics and generative modelling. First, I will show how to differentiate quantum circuits with feature maps and embed derivatives of multidimensional functions. This approach relies on automatic differentiation to represent derivatives in an analytical form, thus avoiding inaccurate finite difference procedures. We refer to the underlying circuits as derivative quantum circuits (DQCs). I will describe the proposed hybrid quantum-classical workflow where DQCs are trained to satisfy nonlinear differential equations and specified boundary conditions. As an example, I will apply the algorithm to solve a problem from computational fluid dynamics. This corresponds to the fluid flow in a convergent-divergent nozzle (described by Navier-Stokes equations), where we predict density, temperature and velocity profiles for the stiff system of equations that can challenge classical solvers. Second, I will also show that DQCs can provide an advantage for generative modelling from stochastic differential equations, giving access to sampling from financially relevant models. Finally, I will discuss the protocols that may be scaled to treat large industrial problems in the future.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75547' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1762)' class='star'><span class='star1762'>&star;</span></a> Ignacio Labarca  <span id='bitlink-2844'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2844)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2844' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2844)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Volume Integral Equations and Single-Trace Formulations for Acoustic Wave Scattering in an Inhomogeneous Medium</b><br />Ignacio Labarca<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-387.html'>Recent Advances on Integral Equation and Spectral Methods for Inhomogeneous Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>We study frequency domain acoustic scattering at a bounded, penetrable, and inhomogeneous obstacle.

Laboratories develop and use different tools to generate data due to the vast number of different experimental, computational and analytical methods used in the MSE domain. Often, this myriad of tools does not follow standardized schemas and results in heterogeneous data when generated in different laboratories and even within the same laboratory. Heterogeneous data is difficult to exchange, reuse and process, resulting in uncoordinated MSE research. In the Data Analytics in Engineering group, we often store numerical results (e.g., homogenized stresses, stress fields, strain fields, plastic strains, ...) as a function of the loading. Description of the loading, its provenance, and authorship is quintessential to know. This information is important for machine learning tasks, however, metadata is usually missing in the produced datasets. Therefore, we need a common and complete description of the stored experimental results. Ontologies and knowledge graphs are state-of-the-art technology to enable such a unified data view. Thereby, we have designed and developed a knowledge graph; by using standardized World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) technologies and interfaces, the access to MSE experiment data enables compliance with the FAIR principles.

This is an extension of the Fluctuating Immersed Boundary (FIB) approach that treats a solute as discrete Lagrangian particles that interact with Eulerian hydrodynamic and electrostatic fields. In both cases the Immersed Boundary (IB) method of Peskin is used for particle-field coupling. Hydrodynamic interactions are taken to be overdamped, with thermal noise incorporated using the fluctuating Stokes equation, including a "dry diffusion" Brownian motion to account for scales not resolved by the coarse-grained model of the solvent. Long range electrostatic interactions are computed by solving the Poisson equation, with short range corrections included using a novel immersed-boundary variant of the classical Particle-Particle Particle-Mesh (P3M) technique. This approach is designed to enable scaling to large problems which are difficult to tackle using many existing mesoscale methods. It has been implemented using the AMReX framework for use on large scale HPC systems, including heterogeneous CPU+GPU architectures.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75537' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1359)' class='star'><span class='star1359'>&star;</span></a> Ignacio Laguna  <span id='bitlink-2847'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2847)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2847' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2847)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Testing and Debugging for Numerical Exceptions in GPU Scientific Applications</b><br />Ignacio Laguna<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-300.html'>Bridging the Gap from HPC Software Engineering to Academic Research</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Testing scientific applications for numerical correctness and reproducibility in GPU systems is a challenging task.

Commonly used GPUs, such as NVIDIA GPUs, provide no support to detect floating-point exceptions, which makes it tricky for developers to mitigate such errors.  In this talk, we present techniques and tools to mitigate different classes of numerical exceptions and anomalies, with a particular focus on GPUs. We present FPChecker and BinFPE, two tools based on LLVM instrumentation and binary instrumentation to detect the location of code affected by floating-point exceptions in the CPU and GPU; we also present Xscope, a Bayesian optimization approach to find inputs that trigger such exceptions in the GPU.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75662' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1837)' class='star'><span class='star1837'>&star;</span></a> Ming-Jun Lai  <span id='bitlink-2848'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2848)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2848' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2848)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem can Break the Curse of Dimensionality When Approximating High Dimensional Functions</b><br />Ming-Jun Lai<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-405.html'>Learning Deep Neural Networks and Sparse Approximations from Limited Data for High-Dimensional Problems in Computational Science and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>We explain how to use Kolmogorov's Superposition Theorem (KST) to overcome the curse of dimensionality in approximating multi-dimensional functions and learning multi-dimensional data sets by using neural networks of two layers. That is, there is a class of functions called K-Lipschitz continuous in the sense that the K-outer function  of  is Lipschitz continuous can be approximated by a ReLU network of two layers with  widths to have an approximation order $\mathcal{O}(d^2/n)$. In addition, we show that polynomials of high degree can be expressed by using neural networks with activation function $\sigma_l(t)=(t_{+})^{l}$ with $l\geq 2$ with multiple layers and appropriate widths. More layers of neural networks, the higher degree polynomials can be reproduced. Hence, the deep learning algorithm can well approximate multi-dimensional data when the number of layers increases with high degree activation function $\sigma_l$. Finally, we present a mathematical justification for image classification by using a deep learning algorithm.

However, it is not clear that prognostic moments form an optimal basis set for representing microphysical processes across the range of conditions experienced in the atmosphere. In addition, microphysical parameterizations employing prognostic moments require developing closure schemes, which are known to suffer from both parametric and structural uncertainty in their representations of inherently higher dimensional cloud processes. These uncertainties limit model fidelity and lead to forecasting errors. Recently, machine learning methods have been used to develop reduced order models of various physical systems by discovering governing equations directly from high-dimensional observational data. Here we investigate how machine learning methods such as variational auto-encoders can be used to learn optimal predictors for microphysical process rates in an unsupervised manner, by simultaneously learning lower dimensional representations of droplet size distributions and predicting their dynamic evolution. We discuss how these findings could be used to either guide moment-based scheme development, or replace them with alternative formulations.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75182' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(985)' class='star'><span class='star985'>&star;</span></a> James V.

It will also be shown that the region of absolute stability exhibits striking behavior that helps explain the effectiveness of these new methods.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75528' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(314)' class='star'><span class='star314'>&star;</span></a> Lena Lambers  <span id='bitlink-2853'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2853)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2853' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2853)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hybrid Data- and Knowledge-Driven Multiscale and Multiphase Simulation of the Human Liver</b><br />Lena Lambers<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-69.html'>Data-Driven Methods in Computational Biomechanics - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>The liver is the central organ for metabolic processes with a complex function-perfusion relationship. This coupled relation can be investigated by numerical multiscale simulations of the total organ, liver lobules and liver cells. To enable robust, efficient, and patient-specific diagnosis and prediction of hepatic diseases through simulations, the purely knowledge-based models are complemented by data-based approaches.  To better understand the relation between hepatic perfusion, metabolism and tissue, we have developed a multicomponent, poroelastic multiphase and multiscale function-perfusion model, using a mixture theory based on the Theory of Porous Media.   To increase the robustness of the model and allow for near real-time patient-specific simulations, computationally critical parts are enhanced by data-driven methods through the integration of experimental, clinical and in silico data from cooperation partners. In addition to purely data-driven methods, we will increase the model robustness and the overall accuracy of the model predictions by exploring hybrid knowledge- and data-driven approaches. The overarching goal is the definition and development of an accurate decision-supporting framework for clinical applications.

In particular, performing wall-resolved large eddy simulations (LES) can predict the steady state performance and help improve the reactor design. High order method is known to be able to capture the turbulence with minimal numerical dissipation. Our spectral element methods code, Nek5000/NekRS, uses curved hexahedral elements that takes O(n) storage where $n=EN^3$ is the number of grid points for E elements and polynomial order N, and with an efficient preconditioner, the computational cost is only O(nN). However, elevating N requires 2-3 orders of magnitude fewer elements than standard finite elements, which brings challenges to meshing complex geometries at large scales.    
We present an all-hex meshing strategy for randomly packed spheres in pebble bed reactors. With Voronoi decomposition, spheres are bounded by cells and the facets are tessellated into quads that are swept to the sphere to generate a base mesh. The singularities at contact points between spheres are covered by the overlapping region to achieve the target void fraction that realizes the correct pressure drop. We generate high quality meshes with $10^2–10^5$ spheres using ~300 elements per sphere. We present mesh quality metrics and its impact to the solver performance under different preconditioners which realizes fluid simulations for full-core pebble bed reactors at exascale platforms.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75848' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1405)' class='star'><span class='star1405'>&star;</span></a> Johannes Langguth  <span id='bitlink-2855'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2855)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2855' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2855)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>ML Accelerator Hardware: A New Model For Parallel Sparse Computations?</b><br />Johannes Langguth<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-309.html'>Recent Advances in Combinatorial Scientific Computing - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>A major recent development in computer hardware was the rise of dedicated accelerator hardware for machine learning applications such as the Graphcore IPUs and Cerebras WSE.

In these methods, the nonlinear problem is first linearized and afterwards decomposed into subdomains. By changing this order, that is, by first decomposing the nonlinear problem, many nonlinear domain decomposition methods have been designed in the last decades. These methods often show a higher robustness and a faster nonlinear convergence compared with classical Newton-Krylov variants. In this talk, Nonlinear-FETI-DP (Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting - Dual Primal) will be discussed. Here, the choice of the nonlinear elimination set, that is, the set of degrees of freedom which are eliminated in a nonlinear fashion, and the choice of the coarse space have a huge impact on the nonlinear and linear convergence behavior. In this talk, we will show new results combining recently developed approaches for the adaptive choice of the nonlinear elimination set with adaptive coarse spaces.

The surface of the diaphragm is represented as the zero-level-set of a global function which is computed by covering the point cloud domain with overlapping patches and computing local solutions on each patch through RBF interpolation. The different solutions are then combined into a global function using weight functions and the data points are then moved to the zero-level-set surface through Newton iteration. The quality of the reconstruction is influenced by several different parameters, the most important of which are the number of stencil points in the local problems, the number of patches covering the domain and a scaling factor which determines the size of the separation between the data representing the lower and upper parts of the diaphragm.

Surface plasmons are highly oscillatory waves localized to the interface between a dielectric (air, vacuum) and a metal (gold, silver). As surface plasmons lead to large field enhancements, they are useful for high-resolution imaging and other applications. It is challenging to capture them numerically, and standard methods do not succeed. In the context of spherical scatterers, we identify where plasmonic excitations can arise, propose a strategy to enrich the solution space with the plasmonic behavior, and construct a mesh to allow us to treat both the highly oscillatory and regular behaviors. In the discrete context, this leads to an enriched finite element method.

When employing a 'soft-sphere' methodology, where particle collisions are multi-bodied and enduring, a neighbor list must be constructed. Traditionally, the neighbor list is built with a grid that is ~2-3X the largest particle diameter. When considering polydisperse solids, the construction of the neighbor list and computation of collision forces becomes computationally prohibitive since many small particles are contained within a cell. Following [Shire et al., 2021, DOI: 10.1007/s40571-020-00361-2], we implement a multi-grid neighbor search algorithm within AMReX; an exascale-compatible, open-source software for block-structured adaptive mesh refinement [Zhang et al., 2021, DOI: 10.1177/10943420211022811].

They are often formulated as non-smooth minimisation problems. In sparse inversion, we minimise, e.g., the sum of a data fidelity term and an L1/LASSO regulariser. In classification, we consider, e.g., the sum of a data fidelity term and a non-smooth Ginzburg--Landau energy.  In this work, we study splitting from a stochastic continuous-time perspective. Indeed, we define a differential inclusion that follows one of the two subtarget function's negative subgradient at each point in time. The choice of the subtarget function is controlled by a binary continuous-time Markov process. The resulting dynamical system is a stochastic approximation of the underlying subgradient flow. We investigate this stochastic approximation for an L1-regularised sparse inversion flow and for a discrete Allen-Cahn equation minimising a Ginzburg--Landau energy. In both cases, we study the longtime behaviour of the stochastic dynamical system and its ability to approximate the underlying subgradient flow at any accuracy. We illustrate our theoretical findings in a simple sparse estimation problem and also in a low-dimensional classification problem.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75425' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(438)' class='star'><span class='star438'>&star;</span></a> Guillaume Lauga  <span id='bitlink-2863'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2863)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2863' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2863)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multilevel Proximal Methods for Image Restoration</b><br />Guillaume Lauga<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-97.html'>Multiresolution and Multilevel Optimization in Imaging</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>We propose a family of multilevel proximal gradient methods going from the simplest multilevel iterative soft-thresholding to inexact and inertial forward-backward extensions.

The proposed meta estimators are particularly efficient within outer-loop applications, such as reliability-based design and shape optimization, when the input distribution of the uncertainties changes with the outer-loop iteration. We derive asymptotic formulae for the variance reduction of the meta estimators in the limit of convergence of the outer-loop applications. We demonstrate the meta estimators, using data-driven surrogates and biasing densities, on an uncertainty propagation problem from nuclear fusion, namely the estimation of energetic particle confinement statistics during a stellarator coil design optimization loop. The numerically measured speedups agree well with the asymptotic variance formulas. The meta estimators outperform all of their constituent variance reduction techniques alone, ultimately yielding two orders of magnitude speedup compared to standard Monte Carlo estimation at the same computational budget.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75247' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1423)' class='star'><span class='star1423'>&star;</span></a> Yann-Meing Law  <span id='bitlink-2865'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2865)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2865' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2865)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Hermite-Taylor Correction Function Method for Embedded Boundary and Maxwell&#8217;s Interface Problems</b><br />Yann-Meing Law<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-313.html'>Recent Advances in Cut Cell Discretizations: Accuracy, Stability, and Applications - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>The Hermite-Taylor method is a high-order method for hyperbolic problems that relies on a Hermite interpolation procedure in space and a Taylor method in time. The stability condition of this method depends only on the largest wave-speed, independent of the order. However, the treatment of general boundary and interface conditions is still a challenge since the Hermite-Taylor method requires not only to know the electromagnetic fields on the boundary and the interface but also their derivatives through order $m$ in each Cartesian coordinate to achieve a ($2\,m+1$)-order accurate method. In this talk, we investigate the correction function method to estimate all the needed information at the nodes near either the boundary or the interface in the Hermite-Taylor setting. The correction function method relies on the minimization of a functional based on Maxwell's equations. This minimization problem has to be solved only for some nodes in the vicinity of the boundary or the interface at each time step. Numerical examples in 1-D and 2-D are performed and the expected convergence order is observed for reasonable values of $m$.

The pair correlation function was thus introduced almost a century ago to succinctly capture the distribution of interparticle distances.  Despite its great success in providing deep insight into countless physical systems and mechanisms, this method can be highly sensitive to structurally insignificant differences among patterns and also insensitive to structurally significant ones.  We show how topological data analysis provides a natural and robust discrete version of this method that is both simple to compute and easy to analyze, providing insight into ordered and disordered systems alike.

By using a regular Cartesian grid that is independent of the geometry, the IB framework yields a robust scheme that can efficiently handle immersed deformable structures. The IB method has also been adapted to problems with prescribed motion. IB methods for these problems traditionally involve penalty forces or they are formulated as constraint problems. In the latter approach, one must find the unknown forces by solving an equation that corresponds to a poorly conditioned first-kind integral equation. This operation can require a large number of iterations of a Krylov method, and since a time-dependent problem requires this solve at each time step, this method can be prohibitively inefficient without preconditioning. In this talk, we introduce a new, well-conditioned IB formulation for flows with rigid bodies, which we call the Immersed Boundary Double Layer (IBDL) method. In this formulation, the equation for the unknown boundary distribution corresponds to a well-conditioned second-kind integral equation that can be solved efficiently with a small number of iterations of a Krylov method without preconditioning. Furthermore, the iteration count is independent of both the mesh size and boundary point spacing. Additionally, while the original constraint method applies only to Dirichlet problems, the IBDL formulation can also be used for Neumann problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75810' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1438)' class='star'><span class='star1438'>&star;</span></a> Roy R.

Cryo-electron microscopes produce many very noisy two-dimensional projection images of individual frozen molecules; unlike related methods, such as computed tomography (CT), the viewing direction of each particle image is unknown. The unknown directions and extreme noise make the determination of the structure of molecules challenging. While other methods for structure determination, such as x-ray crystallography and NMR, measure ensembles of molecules, cryo-electron microscopes produce images of individual particles. Therefore, cryo-EM could potentially be used to study mixtures of conformations of molecules. We will discuss a range of recent methods for analyzing the geometry of molecular conformations using cryo-EM data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75713' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(608)' class='star'><span class='star608'>&star;</span></a> Jaeyong Lee  <span id='bitlink-2870'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2870)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2870' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2870)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Two Approaches Using Deep Learning to Solve Partial Differential Equations</b><br />Jaeyong Lee<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-133.html'>Recent Advances in Modeling, Simulation, and Sampling via Artificial Intelligence for Physical Sciences and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Many differential equations and partial differential equations (PDEs) are being studied to model physical phenomena in nature with mathematical expressions. Recently, new numerical approaches using machine learning and deep learning have been actively studied. There are two mainstream deep learning approaches to approximate solutions to the PDEs, i.e., using neural networks directly to parametrize the solution to the PDE and learning operators from the parameters of the PDEs to their solutions. As the first direction, Physics-Informed Neural Network was introduced in (Raissi, Perdikaris, and Karniadakis 2019), which learns the neural network parameters to minimize the PDE residuals in the least-squares sense. On the other side, operator learning using neural networks has been studied to approximate a PDE solution operator, which is nonlinear and complex in general. In this talk, I will introduce these two ways to approximate the solution of PDE and my research related to them.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75421' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1966)' class='star'><span class='star1966'>&star;</span></a> Jia Yin Lee  <span id='bitlink-2871'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2871)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2871' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2871)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Pattern Formation in a Nonlocal Lotka-Volterra System</b><br />Jia Yin Lee<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1990)' class='star'><span class='star1990'>&star;</span></a> Jinsil Lee  <span id='bitlink-2872'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2872)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2872' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2872)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Multivariate Spline Based Collocation Method for Numerical Solution of PDEs</b><br />Jinsil Lee<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-411.html'>High-Order Methods for PDEs</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>We propose a collocation method based on multivariate polynomial splines over triangulation or tetrahedralization for the numerical solution of partial differential equations.

The process learns generalized Casimirs for energy and entropy guaranteed to be conserved and nondecreasing, respectively. Furthermore, for the case of added thermal noise, we guarantee exact preservation of a fluctuation-dissipation theorem, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. We provide benchmarks for dissipative systems demonstrating learned dynamics are more robust and generalize better than either" black-box" or penalty-based approaches.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75364' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(386)' class='star'><span class='star386'>&star;</span></a> Ming-Hsiao Lee  <span id='bitlink-2874'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2874)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2874' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2874)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Effective Modelling for PCBA Warpage Simulation</b><br />Ming-Hsiao Lee<br />Thursday, March 2 3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-85.html'>Mathematics for Industry in the Asia Pacific Area - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>A printed circuit board (PCB) is a multi-layered composite which includes many layers of copper circuits and dielectric materials. It is used as a backbone to carry and connect various electronic components, i.e. PCBA, to achieve certain functions. However, because the components are decreasing in size, the reliability of PCBA have become a critical issue. One of the serious problems is the warpage, which is induced by the thermal mismatch between unevenly-distributed circuits, dielectric layers and assembled components during the manufacturing process which experiences a temperature variation. This may cause defects in the assemblies. It is helpful to simulate in advance to evaluate. However, since the circuit on a PCB is very tiny compared with the size of the PCB or the components, it is too difficult to build a finite element model to include all the details of circuits and components. Hence, a feasible way is needed. Here, a new effective modelling approach which adopts equivalent material properties is proposed for PCBA warpage simulation. In this approach, the multi-layered PCB with connected components (PCBA) are meshed and connected properly, and the model is not too large while the circuit’s effect is still considered. With the proposed approaches, this method can be useful and efficient to simulate the PCBA manufacturing process to evaluate the warpage of the PCBA. Even those cases with irregular-shaped PCBs and shielding frames can be also treated efficiently.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75347' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1635)' class='star'><span class='star1635'>&star;</span></a> Wen-shin Lee  <span id='bitlink-2875'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2875)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2875' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2875)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards the Future Removal of Bandwidth Constraints</b><br />Wen-shin Lee<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-361.html'>Superresolution in Exponential Analysis - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>The Nyquist condition which imposes a condition on the sampling step used when collecting data from a digital signal, in terms of the frequencies present in the signal, is at the basis of many digital signal processing algorithms.    
The Nyquist constraint can be circumvented by using mutually prime multiples of the sampling step, as in coprime arrays. The performamnce of the latter can be improved to using mutually prime scale and shift parameters instead of two mutually prime scales. We show that the bandwidth condition can be further stretched by cleverly choosing the multiples of the sampling step. Can we remove the bandwidth condition entirely?

For a signal with both sparsity and smoothness, it is natural to use regularization that changes over different signal locations to account for corresponding characteristics, which we call inhomogeneous regularization. In this work, we use Ensemble Kalman Inversion for inhomogeneous regularization. The ensemble provides prior information for classifying characteristics to determine the power $p$ for $l_p$ regularization. Once the characteristics are determined, Ensemble Kalman Inversion uses the transformation-based approach for $l_p$ regularization as an efficient solver for inhomogeneous regularization problems. The work validates the effectiveness and robustness of the inhomogeneous regularization problem using Ensemble Kalman inversion through a suite of stringent 1D and 2D test problems, including sea ice image recovery that shows both smooth heterogeneous variations and local cracks.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75294' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(861)' class='star'><span class='star861'>&star;</span></a> Aline Lefebvre-Lepot  <span id='bitlink-2878'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2878)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2878' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2878)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Numerical Simulations of Suspensions: Lubrication Correction Including Fluid Correction</b><br />Aline Lefebvre-Lepot<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-188.html'>Numerical Methods for Particle Suspensions and Fluid-Structure Interactions at Small Scales - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>We address the problem of numerical simulation of suspensions of rigid particles in a Stokes flow. We focus on the inclusion of the singular short range interaction effects (lubrication effects) in the simulations when the particles come close one to another. The problem is solved without introducing new hypothesis nor model. The key idea is to decompose the velocity and pressure flows in a sum of a singular and a regular part. The singular part is computed using an explicit asymptotic expansion of the solution when the distance goes to zero. This expansion can be computed for any locally convex (that is the particles have to be convex close to the contact point) and regular shape of particles. We prove that the remaining part is regular in the sense that it is bounded independently of the distance. As a consequence, only a small number of degrees of freedom are necessary to compute numerically this remaining regular part of the solution and obtain accurate results. The method is tested in dimension 2 for clusters of two or three aligned particles with general rigid velocities. We show that, as expected, the convergence is independent of the distance.

In this paper, a systematic study of the predictive capability of LES across a range of angles of attack (including maximum lift and post-stall regimes), the robustness of the predictions to grid resolution and the incorporation of wind tunnel effects is carried out. Integrated engineering quantities of interest, such as lift, drag and pitching moment will be compared with experimental data, while sectional pressure forces will be used to corroborate the accuracy of the integrated quantities.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75868' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1349)' class='star'><span class='star1349'>&star;</span></a> Simon Lemaire  <span id='bitlink-2880'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2880)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2880' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2880)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High-Order Polyhedral Methods for Electromagnetics</b><br />Simon Lemaire<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-297.html'>Mesh Constraints: From Specific to General Meshes</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>This talk will review the recent developments in the HHO approximation of (three-dimensional) electromagnetics problems. Introduced in 2014, the Hybrid High-Order (HHO for short) method provides a novel framework for the discretization of models based on PDEs. Its construction hinges on (hybrid) polynomial unknowns attached to both the cells and the faces of the mesh. HHO methods have several assets: (i) they are applicable on general polyhedral meshes, (ii) they allow for an arbitrarily large approximation order, and (iii) they are amenable to static condensation, thus allowing for a reduced computational burden. This talk will focus in particular on magnetostatics models. In that case, the well-posedness of HHO schemes hinges on (discrete) hybrid Weber inequalities, whose statement strongly depends on the topology of the problem at hand. This is a joint work with F. Chave and D. A.

These operations become intractable for large scale structure-from-motion datasets. For pure permutation synchronization, the recent Cycle-Edge Message Passing (CEMP) framework suggests a memory-efficient and fast solution. Here we overcome the restriction of CEMP to compact groups and propose an improved algorithm, CEMP-Partial, for estimating the corruption levels of the observed partial permutations. It allows us to subsequently implement a nonconvex weighted projected power method without the need of spectral initialization. The resulting new PPS algorithm, MatchFAME (Fast, Accurate and Memory-Efficient Matching), only involves sparse matrix operations, and thus enjoys lower time and space complexities in comparison to previous PPS algorithms. We prove that under adversarial corruption, though without additive noise and with certain assumptions, CEMP-Partial is able to exactly classify corrupted and clean partial permutations. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy, speed and memory efficiency of our method on both synthetic and real datasets.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75820' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(374)' class='star'><span class='star374'>&star;</span></a> Elo&#239;se Letournel  <span id='bitlink-2882'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2882)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2882' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2882)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Numerical Analysis of Linear Response in Time-Dependent Mean-Field Models of Quantum Mechanics</b><br />Elo&#239;se Letournel<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-83.html'>Recent Advances in Numerical Methods for Electronic Structure Calculations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>We study a non linear mean field model for quantum mechanics for a $N$-particle system (such as time-dependent density functional theory).

Numerical simulations can facilitate the investigation of the relationship between the diffusion MRI signals and cellular structures. With the rapid advance of available computing power, the diffusion MRI community has begun to employ numerical simulations for model formulation and validation, as well as for imaging sequence optimization.  Existing simulation frameworks use the finite difference method, the finite element method, or the Matrix Formalism method to solve the Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation.  We propose a new method based on the efficient evaluation of layer potentials. In this paper, the mathematical framework and the numerical implementation of the new method are described.  We demonstrate the convergence of our method via numerical experiments and analyze the errors linked to various model and simulation parameters. Since our method provides a Fourier-type representation of the diffusion MRI signal, it can potentially facilitate new physical and biological signal interpretations in the future.

Our framework consists of the newly introduced wide-band butterfly network coupled with a simple training procedure which dynamically injects noise during training. While our trained network provides competitive results in classical imaging regimes, most notably it also succeeds in the super-resolution regime where other comparable methods fail. This encompasses both (i) reconstruction of scatterers with sub-wavelength geometric features, and (ii) accurate imaging when two or more scatterers are separated by less than the classical diffraction limit. We demonstrate these properties are retained even in the presence of strong noise and extend to scatterers not previously seen in the training set. In addition, our network is straightforward to train requiring no restarts and has an online runtime that is an order of magnitude faster than optimization-based algorithms. We perform experiments with a variety of wave scattering mediums and we demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms both classical inversion and competing network architectures that specialize in oscillatory wave scattering data.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75326' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1910)' class='star'><span class='star1910'>&star;</span></a> Mou Li  <span id='bitlink-2885'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2885)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2885' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2885)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Learning Sparse Approximate Inverse Preconditioners with Graph-Conditioned Variational Auto-Encoders</b><br />Mou Li<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(881)' class='star'><span class='star881'>&star;</span></a> Qianxiao Li  <span id='bitlink-2886'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2886)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2886' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2886)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Approximation Theory of Deep Learning for Sequence Modelling</b><br />Qianxiao Li<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-193.html'>Deep Learning for Sequence Modeling - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we present some recent results on the approximation theory of deep learning architectures for sequence modelling.

The present work leverages a randomization strategy to remove bias entirely, which simplifies estimation substantially, particularly in the MIMC context, where the choice of index set is otherwise important. With theoretical results, the proposed method provably achieves the same canonical complexity of MSE$^{-1}$ under appropriate assumptions as the original method, but without discretization bias.

Experimental design often involves choosing the observation map to minimise uncertainty in the parameter estimate. However, for some inverse problems, error in the solution map may arise due to inaccurate mathematical models or the use of surrogates. This error may propagate to error in the forward model and thus lead to biased parameter estimates. If the bias in the estimate is large, then minimising uncertainty about the estimate is undesirable, and the need arises for experimental design that takes into account error in the solution map. We consider some natural approaches for modeling the error in the solution map, and use theoretical results about local Lipschitz stability of the posterior in order to suggest how one may choose the observation map for each approach.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75414' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(400)' class='star'><span class='star400'>&star;</span></a> Kim Liegeois  <span id='bitlink-2892'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2892)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2892' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2892)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Computational Efficient Estimation of the Extreme Event Probability of the Mass Loss of Antarctic Ice Sheets</b><br />Kim Liegeois<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-89.html'>Advanced Computational Methods for Ice-Sheet Modeling and Analysis - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>The mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheets is one of the major causes of the sea level rise.   Future projections of sea level rise have a large variability due to uncertainties in the climate models and socioeconomics factors, and it is important to study low-probability but high-risk scenarios.  Standard Monte Carlo methods may require an infeasible large number of expensive forward simulations to obtain useful estimate of extreme events probability.  In this presentation, we explore forward uncertainty quantification methods that rely on optimization strategies to estimate these probabilities.  The proposed UQ methods build on ideas from PDE-constrained optimization and the probability estimation of tail probabilities.  We illustrate that this approach is computationally more efficient than using standard Monte Carlo methods with larger number of expensive forward simulations when estimating the probability of extreme mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheets.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75353' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(792)' class='star'><span class='star792'>&star;</span></a> Bjoern Liljegren-Sailer  <span id='bitlink-2893'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2893)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2893' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2893)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Realization-Free Balancing-Related Model Reduction Approach from Frequency Response Data</b><br />Bjoern Liljegren-Sailer<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-173.html'>System-Theoretic Learning Methods and Model Reduction -  - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>Balancing-related model order reduction methods guarantee stable reduced-order models, and additionally, a priori error bounds have been derived for them. However, the explicit numerical implementation of such methods is often computationally demanding and it is intrusive; this means that it requires explicit access to the matrices scaling the state variables in the original (full-order) dynamical system.    
For the classical Balanced Truncation (BT) method, and for a few more recent extensions of it, approximate implementations have been derived, which make the application to the large-scale setting more feasible. For time simulation near steady state or for low-frequency applications, the Singular Perturbation Approximation (SPA) method [Fernando/Nicholson, Internat. J. Control, 1982] is known to have better approximation properties than BT.    
In this contribution, we derive an approximate implementation of SPA that alleviates the computational burden for computing the reduced-order models and can be applied also for such cases in which explicit access to the original dynamical system is not granted. Only transfer function evaluations are required in our approach. Specifically, we adapt and extend the purely data-driven (approximate) implementation of BT in [Gosea/Gugercin/Beattie, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2022] to SPA, which as such is strongly related to  the Loewner framework. The performance of our proposed method is illustrated by several numerical results.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75472' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(153)' class='star'><span class='star153'>&star;</span></a> Sookkyung Lim  <span id='bitlink-2894'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2894)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2894' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2894)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Understanding Bacterial Swimming in E.

Our simulations reveal that physical properties of the hook and the counterrotation of the cell body are important factors for efficient flagellar bundling, and that longer hooks in mutant cell models create an instability and disrupt the bundling process, resulting in a limited range of movement.

This is particularly the case for accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs), which require a substantial amount of work to keep them operating efficiently and solving smaller problems one after another would be highly inefficient. An example use case is found in the XGC gyrokinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code used for modeling magnetically confined fusion plasma devices.  The collision operator employs a LAPACK linear solver, which does not run on a GPU, for current production runs.  As these matrices are well-conditioned, batched iterative sparse solvers are an attractive option.  A proxy application has been created for facilitating optimizations and porting of the collision operator to GPUs.  We describe how Ginkgo's batched solver can be integrated into the collision kernel and accelerate the simulation process. Comparisons for the solve times on NVIDIA V100 and A100 GPUs and AMD MI100 GPUs with a CPU node  are presented for matrices from the collision kernel of XGC. The results suggest that Ginkgo's batched sparse iterative solvers are well suited for efficient utilization of the GPU for this problem, and the performance portability of Ginkgo in conjunction with Kokkos (used within XGC as the heterogeneous programming model) allows seamless execution for exascale oriented heterogeneous architectures.

In particular, we propose the use of a deep variational autoencoder, which encodes high dimensional turbulent flow into disentangled low dimensional representations. Benefiting from extremely weak correlation between latent dimensions, we implement latent Bayesian online changepoint detection algorithm to identify regime transition. We deploy this state-of-art two-stage data-driven approach on the Kolmogorov flow dataset, revealing an accurate correlation between the detected changepoint and a regime transition.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75223' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1015)' class='star'><span class='star1015'>&star;</span></a> Jonathan Lindbloom  <span id='bitlink-2897'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2897)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2897' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2897)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Computational Strategies for Bayesian Inversion with Conditionally Gaussian Sparsity Priors</b><br />Jonathan Lindbloom<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-222.html'>Sparsity-Promoting Bayesian Inverse Problems</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>In many practical Bayesian linear inverse problems, important parameters such as the noise covariance and the ideal strength of regularization are unknown a priori. Furthermore, adopting a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) approach we may wish to employ a sparsity-promoting prior that strongly promotes sparsity in a linear transform of the unknown. It has been shown that both concerns may be addressed using hierarchical Bayesian models that employ conditionally Gaussian priors with various choices of hyper-priors. However, the resulting posterior densities are typically no longer log-concave, which creates convergence concerns when using either optimization or sampling to characterize the posterior distribution. With this in mind, here we study iterative algorithms for posterior point estimation, particularly with regards to more general measurement and regularization settings. In particular, we consider the scenario that the noise covariance of one or several data sources are unknown and made part of the inference procedure, and when sparsity is promoted in multiple transforms of the unknown. We then apply recent data-augmentation techniques to accelerate the methods for large-scale problems such as image-deblurring and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) despeckling. We demonstrate the performance of our methods on a suite of numerical examples.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75540' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1388)' class='star'><span class='star1388'>&star;</span></a> Viktor Linders  <span id='bitlink-2898'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2898)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2898' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2898)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Nonlinear Waves and Entropy Stable Iteration</b><br />Viktor Linders<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-306.html'>Fast Algorithms for Variable Coefficient, Time-Dependent, and Inhomogeneous Problems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Long time simulations of nonlinear wave equations have applications in the study of light propagation in optical fibers, surface gravitation and deep water waves. A common feature of such equations is the presence of high order spatial derivatives, rendering implicit methods necessary for their simulation.    
The equations considered here are accompanied by an entropy conservation principle. It is known that simulations based on entropy conservative discretizations display favorable error growth (typically linear in time) compared to non-conservative alternatives (typically quadratic). This result assumes that the nonlinear systems of equations arising from the implicit scheme are solved exactly, or nearly so. However, in practice the discrete solution is approximated using  iterative methods that are terminated after a finite number of iterations. Since iterative methods have not been derived with entropy conservation in mind, entropy conservation is generally violated, thus compromising the favorable error growth.    
We discuss techniques based on relaxation and modifications of existing methods for reclaiming entropy conservation with iterative solvers that otherwise violate this principle. Certain iterative methods, as well as relaxation techniques, impact on the flow of time. This can be exploited to improve the quality of long time simulations. Numerical experiments indicate that accurate solutions can be obtained with comparably large tolerances on the iterations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75685' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1322)' class='star'><span class='star1322'>&star;</span></a> Neil Lindquist  <span id='bitlink-2899'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2899)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2899' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2899)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Portable C++ for Modern, Heterogenous Mixed-Precision Methods</b><br />Neil Lindquist<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-291.html'>Recent Advances in Numerical Linear Algebra Programming and Libraries - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Mixed precision methods are increasingly popular in numerical linear algebra.

It relies on the fast Fourier transform, which imposes a strict requirement for equispaced data. In this work, we propose a neural operator learning method utilizing a generalized Vandermonde structured matrix to act as a surrogate for the forward and inverse pass of the Fourier transform on nonequispaced data, while still maintaining quasi-linear operational complexity. Our results show that the proposed Vandermonde neural operator surpasses the Fourier neural operator in speed, while maintaining its accuracy. The simple structure makes this method ideal for applying neural operator learning to the nonequispaced lattice, as well as real-world data collected on a global scale.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75335' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(37)' class='star'><span class='star37'>&star;</span></a> Mario Lino  <span id='bitlink-2901'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2901)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2901' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2901)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multi-Scale and Rotation-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for the Simulation of Fluid Dynamics</b><br />Mario Lino<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-8.html'>Scaling Data Science, AI, and, ML on Massively Multi-Threaded Systems - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>The numerical simulation of fluid dynamics is an essential tool in many areas of science and engineering. However, its high computational cost can limit application in practice. Recent deep-learning approaches have demonstrated the potential to yield surrogate models for fluid dynamics simulation. While such models exhibit lower accuracy in comparison, their low runtime makes them appealing for design-space exploration and real-time simulation. We introduce two novel graph neural networks (GNNs) for extrapolating the time evolution of a fluid in an unstructured discretization of the domain. In both models, previous states are processed through multiple coarsenings of the graph, which enables faster information propagation through the fluid domain and improves the capture and forecast of the system state. One of the models is architecturally equivariant to rotations, which allows the network to learn the underlying physics more efficiently. We analyse these models using two canonical fluid models: advection and incompressible fluid dynamics. Our results show that the proposed models can generalise from uniform advection fields to high-gradient fields on complex domains. The multi-scale graph architecture allows for inference of incompressible Navier-Stokes solutions, within a range of Reynolds numbers and design parameters, more effectively than a single-scale GNN. Simulations are between $10^2$ to $10^4$ times faster than the numerical solutions on which they were trained.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75194' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1488)' class='star'><span class='star1488'>&star;</span></a> Robert P.

The dynamics is represented by an ode in terms of nonlocal constitutive laws relating force to deformation. Here the length scale of nonlocality is taken on the particle length scale and is smaller than the mesoscopic length scale characterizing the flow.

However, it is in its infancy in that of low-dimensional, generalized-coordinate-based simulations such as those performed using projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs). This talk presents a complete framework for executing PROMs in the presence of AMR that builds on elements of readily available methods while contributing several critical new ones. In particular, it introduces an efficient algorithm for computing a pseudo-meshless inner product between AMR snapshots for the purpose of projection and clustering. The proposed framework allows for hyperreduction, which is often necessary for parametric and/or nonlinear problems: for this purpose, it incorporates the energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) method. It relies on the concept of local reduced-order bases to achieve computational tractability in the presence of AMR. All new ideas described in the talk are illustrated with the solution of three-dimensional, nonlinear, convection-dominated turbulent flow problems. Their impact is highlighted by the significant speedups that they deliver for realistic problems.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75560' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1935)' class='star'><span class='star1935'>&star;</span></a> Hayden Liu Weng  <span id='bitlink-2904'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2904)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2904' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2904)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data-Driven Solver Selection for Sparse Linear Matrices at Scale</b><br />Hayden Liu Weng<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1418)' class='star'><span class='star1418'>&star;</span></a> Jun Liu  <span id='bitlink-2905'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2905)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2905' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2905)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Numerically Consistent Unstructured Volume-of-Fluid Discretization for the Two-Phase Momentum Convection with High-Density Ratios</b><br />Jun Liu<br />Friday, March 3 10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-312.html'>Recent Advances in Cut Cell Discretizations: Accuracy, Stability, and Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>We extend the numerically consistent discretization of the single-field two-phase momentum convection from the $\rho$LENT method – an unstructured Level Set / Front Tracking method – to the isoAdvection VOF method. The numerical consistency of the momentum convection term in the discretized single-field Navier-Stokes equations is crucial for the numerical stability when simulating two-phase flows with high density ratios. We use an auxiliary mass transport equation to ensure the numerical consistency. A careful derivation of the unstructured VOF discretization indicates that an exact solution of the volume fraction equation is equivalent to solving this auxiliary mass equation. However, equation discretization is unavoidable, and it introduces the inequality between the numerical integration of the mass flux $\rho_f F_f$ and the geometrical integration of the phase-specific volume by the VOF method. Two numerically consistent discretizations are possible with the isoAdvection VOF method. First, an auxiliary mass equation can be solved, while carefully dealing with the face-centered density. Second, an appropriate discretization scheme chosen for the momentum convection term stabilizes the solution. Multiple droplet studies with the density-ratio range $\rho^-/\rho^+ \in [1, 10000]$ are used to verify the discretization.

However, compressed sensing massively loses signal quality. In theory, it violates fundamental  principle of approximation theory, which spawned the enormous success of data compression technologies.

In compliance with the principle of  best n-term approximation and based on discovery of a new logical phenomenon, high efficiency sensing radically  rectifies mathematical rationale, while immensely improves technical performance.

In the past, several butterfly-based direct solvers have been developed to demonstrate reduced complexities. The critical component for constructing these solvers is to reconstruct a butterfly representation of a block from fast randomized black-box matrix-vector multiplications. Previously we developed a randomized butterfly algorithm that yields an $O(N^{1.5}\mathrm{log}N)$ complexity for a $N\times N$ block. In this work, we show some recent progress on developing an improved randomized algorithm that detects and prunes the sparsity patterns of a butterfly on-the-fly. Empirical studies show that an $O(N\mathrm{log}^2N)$ complexity is achievable for several classes of butterfly matrices.

"Goal-oriented adaptive finite element multilevel Monte Carlo with convergence rates." Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering (2022)] method to solve an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) with lognormal random input data, where the PDE model is subject to geometry-induced singularity.     
The previous work [Moon, K-S., et al. "Convergence rates for an adaptive dual weighted residual finite element algorithm." BIT Numerical Mathematics 46.2 (2006)] developed convergence rates for a goal-oriented adaptive algorithm based on isoparametric d-linear quadrilateral finite element approximations and the dual weighted residual error representation in the deterministic setting. This algorithm refines the mesh based on the error contribution to the QoI.     
This work aims to combine MLMC and the adaptive finite element solver. Contrary to the standard Multilevel Monte Carlo methods, where samples are computed using a discretization-based numerical method, whose resolution is linked to the level, our AMLMC algorithm uses a sequence of tolerances as the levels. Specifically, for a given realization of the input coefficient and a given accuracy level, the AMLMC constructs its approximate sample as the ones using the first mesh in the sequence of deterministic, non-uniform meshes generated by the above-mentioned adaptive algorithm that satisfies the sample-dependent bias constraint.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75577' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(408)' class='star'><span class='star408'>&star;</span></a> Oren E.

This task arises when estimating a covariance matrix from noisy data or due to model constraints, which can cause spurious small negative eigenvalues. A special case is the problem of finding the nearest well-conditioned PD matrix to a given matrix. RCO explicitly optimizes the entries of the Cholesky factor. This requires solving a regularized nonlinear optimization problem, for which we apply Newton-CG and exploit the Hessian's sparsity. The regularization parameter is determined via numerical continuation with an accuracy-conditioning trade-off criterion.    
We apply RCO to our motivating educational measurement application of estimating the covariance matrix of an Empirical Best Linear Prediction (EBLP) of school growth scores. RCO outperformed general-purpose near-PD algorithms (Higham's method; Tanaka-Nakata) in terms of the EBLP estimate bias and accuracy of its mean squared error. We present results for two empirical datasets: a large urban school district dataset and state dataset.    
For finding the nearest PD matrix, RCO yields similar results to near-PD methods. While all methods admit an $O(n^3)$ runtime complexity, RCO's constant is $100 \times$ larger, thus it is best suited for general objective functions as opposed to this particular task.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75359' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(184)' class='star'><span class='star184'>&star;</span></a> Estefania Loayza-Romero  <span id='bitlink-2911'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2911)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2911' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2911)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quasi-Newton Methods for Fully Discrete Shape Optimization Problems</b><br />Estefania Loayza-Romero<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-40.html'>Advances in Optimal Control and Shape Optimization Concerning Applications in Physics and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we will consider fully discrete PDE-constrained shape optimization problems in 2D.

We propose an approximation for the Riemannian parallel transport and logarithm on the manifold of planar triangular meshes based on the discrete geodesic calculus proposed in [Rumpf, Wirth, Variational time discretization of geodesic calculus,2015, doi:10.1093/imanum/dru027].

The hydrodynamic reach of a single particle is extremely wide, preventing application of straightforward numerical-simulation approaches (e.g. finite-volume CFD). Furthermore, their scale renders the conventional Navier-Stokes equations, and associated boundary conditions, inaccurate, unable to capture rarefied effects such as thermophoresis and velocity slip. The problems are especially challenging in the transitional Knudsen regime for non-canonical geometries.    
In this paper, a framework is presented for simulating micro-scale particulate flows using the Method of Fundamental Solutions, applied to the linearised Grad’s 13 moment equations, which provides a convenient and numerically efficient alternative to solving the full Boltzmann equation.     
A range of particulate geometry are considered, including agglomerates, such as soot. We present a methodology to couple heat transfer within the solid particle (i.e. for problems of finite particle conductivity) to that of the external rarefied gas flowfield. Results are compared to available experimental results and known analytical results, where they exist.

Due to the requirement of solving a least squares problem (LSP) at each iteration, every iteration of AA requires some number of synchronization steps for global reductions. Performance of AA at scale on distributed systems is typically dependent upon the cost of solving this LSP or application of the underlying fixed point function. In this talk, we highlight approaches to low synchronization orthogonalization routines to reduce the overheard of the LSP solve and note that when performance is dependent upon the fixed point function evaluations, the reduction in synchronizations has little impact on overall performance. To reduce the overhead of costly function evaluations, there has been recent work done to modify the AA algorithm itself, such as alternating AA or non-stationary AA, methods which result in more rapid convergence than standard AA, thus reducing the number of function evaluations required for convergence. Overall, we explore several of these advances within the field of AA and their potential in developing scalable AA solvers on emerging supercomputer architectures.

When sampling from Bayesian posterior distributions, widely used schemes such as Langevin Dynamics or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo quickly become unfeasible as the data sets (and models) grow. This is because their dynamics is governed by the gradient of the log-posterior, whose computational complexity is linear in the size of the data set. I will present some work on using stochastic gradients in the samplers, obtained by data set subsampling, in order to decrease computational cost (an approach that is well-known from the neighbouring field of loss function optimization in neural network training). In particular, I will focus on the use of Metropolis correction of the bias introduced by gradient noise and highlight efficiency related issues.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75420' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(528)' class='star'><span class='star528'>&star;</span></a> Jean-Christophe Loiseau  <span id='bitlink-2916'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2916)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2916' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2916)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Submodular Optimization for Near-Optimal Sensor and Actuator Placement</b><br />Jean-Christophe Loiseau<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-115.html'>Reduced-Complexity Models for Fluid Flows - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Adequately choosing sensors to monitor a high-dimensional system is of utmost importance in numerous situations, most notably for feedback control applications. Yet, optimal sensor and actuator placement is a rapidly intractable combinatorial problem. Following an optimal design strategy, near-optimal selections can still be obtained using various convex relaxations of the otherwise combinatorial problem. One major drawback however is the limited scalability of the algorithms used to solve these convex problems in practice, or their long time to solution.  Based on the theory of modular and submodular functions, this contribution will present different algorithms for sensor selection having extremely high computational efficiency along with near-optimal guarantees. We will focus in particular on D-optimality and compare the performances of a semi-definite programming relaxation of the problem against that of the corresponding submodular relaxation and SupSub approximation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75391' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(931)' class='star'><span class='star931'>&star;</span></a> Arthur Loison  <span id='bitlink-2917'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2917)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2917' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2917)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Kinetic-Based Two-Phase Flow Model: a Reduced-Order Model of Polydisperse Oscillating Droplets with Geometrical Variables</b><br />Arthur Loison<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-204.html'>Multiscale Methods for Kinetic Models: Theory and Numerics - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>We consider two-phase compressible flows involving both separate regime where the interface dynamics is &#8220;smooth' and disperse regimes i.e. sprays of droplets. We introduced multi-fluid two-scale models whose large-scale is adapted to separate regime while the small-scale is for the disperse regime. The modeling of the latter relies on a kinetic modeling of the small-scale disperse phase. Originally proposed by [Williams, 1958], a kinetic-based model fits well the disperse configuration when the droplets are sufficiently distant from each other. However, the separate regime is not suited for such a description and averaged descriptions of the dynamics have been privileged. [Pope, 1988] proposed a probabilistic framework for separate regime, and it has been successfully extended to disperse flows by [Essadki, 2019] for spherical droplets. These works also underlined the key role of geometrical variables in the construction of a unified model for all regimes.    
This work proposes a polydisperse flow model of oscillating droplets extending Essadki's work. First, we propose a new set of geometrical variables along with the associated Williams-Boltzmann equation, recovering the work of [O’Rourke & Amsden, 1987]. Second, the moments compatible with Pope’s framework are identified. Finally, we propose realizable schemes [Ait Ameur, 2022] for simulations of the spray with both monodisperse and polydisperse closures.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75514' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1018)' class='star'><span class='star1018'>&star;</span></a> Joaquim Loizu  <span id='bitlink-2918'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2918)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2918' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2918)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimizing Stellarators to Preserve Magnetic Surfaces at High Plasma Pressure</b><br />Joaquim Loizu<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-223.html'>Computational Challenges in Fusion Plasma Confinement</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Stellarators are a promising concept for the development of controlled fusion power plants. They rely on the confinement of a hot plasma in a topologically toroidal vessel by using magnetic fields that are entirely generated externally. Since the charged particles in the plasma tend to follow magnetic field lines, a magnetic field that foliates nested surfaces is desirable. These magnetic surfaces can act as heat and particle transport barriers and in particular this is guaranteed if certain symmetries are ensured. The presence of the plasma, however, implies the existence of electric currents inside the confinement volume that scale with the plasma pressure. These currents perturb the magnetic field and, beyond a certain pressure limit, can break the magnetic surfaces. The breaking of the surfaces, which often leads to magnetic field line chaos, allows magnetic field lines to undergo large excursions across the device, which can be detrimental for confinement. In this talk I will show how these pressure limits can be predicted and how they can be increased by optimizing the external magnetic field or by externally perturbing the plasma current. This involves solving the magneto-hydrodynamic equilibrium problem in three dimensions, a fantastic numerical challenge that requires treating magnetic field discontinuities as well as chaotic magnetic field lines.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75545' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2016)' class='star'><span class='star2016'>&star;</span></a> Antonio Longa  <span id='bitlink-2919'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2919)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2919' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2919)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Hands-on Introduction to Geometric Deep Learning, with Examples in PyTorch Geometric</b><br />Antonio Longa<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-419.html'>A Hands-on Introduction to Geometric Deep Learning, with Examples in PyTorch Geometric - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77169' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2018)' class='star'><span class='star2018'>&star;</span></a> Antonio Longa  <span id='bitlink-2920'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2920)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2920' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2920)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Hands-on Introduction to Geometric Deep Learning, with Examples in PyTorch Geometric</b><br />Antonio Longa<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-420.html'>A Hands-on Introduction to Geometric Deep Learning, with Examples in PyTorch Geometric - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77170' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1577)' class='star'><span class='star1577'>&star;</span></a> Victoria L&#243;pez  <span id='bitlink-2921'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2921)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2921' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2921)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Verification of the Integration Process and Aggregation of Health Data from Portable Sensors</b><br />Victoria L&#243;pez<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-348.html'>Recent Advances in Federated Learning and Differential Privacy</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>Wearable devices are increasingly useful for the personalization of medical treatments. The manufacturers of these devices apply algorithms for aggregation and dimensionality reduction of the raw data collected to show the client a more user-friendly version that is easier to interpret. However, neither the raw data nor the details of the aggregation process are provided by the manufacturer, so in most cases they function as a black box for the user. Given the relevance of the information presented to the user, its application and the consequences of its interpretation (behavior modification, medication administration, etc.), it is essential to verify the algorithms used in the process to guarantee that the information presented really corresponds to the information collected by the sensors. In this work we present a suitable system for the verification of aggregated data from personal activity monitoring sensors. The system includes a parsing algorithm that does the data structure and relates it to the output. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been tested with real data over a period of two years and both for daytime activity and for monitoring sleep quality. The algorithm is perfectly scalable to be used in any device, so the computer system presented can be useful for the future computer audit of this type of process.

This information between the column/row entities of the matrix is expressed as a graph.  In our work, we are interested in the network of automatic stations of the Royal Meteorological Institute (RMI) in Belgium, which provides temperature measurements at 10-minute intervals. We evaluated the effectiveness and importance of good spatial and temporal graphs for improving the completion of missing data in these meteorological data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75715' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(765)' class='star'><span class='star765'>&star;</span></a> Dimitrios Loukrezis  <span id='bitlink-2923'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2923)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2923' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2923)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Surrogate Modeling, Uncertainty Quantification, and Sensitivity Analysis for Thermal Circuit Models of Electric Machines</b><br />Dimitrios Loukrezis<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-167.html'>Computational Methods for Electric Machines - Part II of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Thermal circuit models offer a computationally inexpensive alternative for assessing the performance of electric machine designs, as opposed to resource-demanding thermal and multiphysics simulations, e.g., based on finite element or finite volume methods. However, the simplifications that are necessary to establish a thermal circuit model introduce a number of uncertain model parameters. Variations in these parameters may significantly affect model-based predictions and, eventually, machine performance. In this study, we present surrogate modeling methods based on data-driven, regression-based Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCEs), which allow to perform uncertainty analyses and estimate the impact of said uncertainties on scalar- and vector-valued machine model outputs, both effectively and accurately. Additionally, the sensitivity of model outputs on the uncertain parameters is assessed by means of a PCE-based Sobol sensitivity analysis, which is additionally extended to the vector-valued output case by means of generalized Sobol indices. Sensitivity analysis results are also used to reduce the number of considered uncertainties to a minimum, by neglecting non-influential model parameters, thus reducing the computational demand of subsequent studies.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75463' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1532)' class='star'><span class='star1532'>&star;</span></a> Alexei Lozinski  <span id='bitlink-2924'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2924)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2924' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2924)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>$\phi$-Fem: Finite Elements on Unfitted Grids to Train Convolutional Neural Networks</b><br />Alexei Lozinski<br />Thursday, March 2 5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-337.html'>Machine Learning and Digital Twins</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>$\phi$-FEM is a recently proposed finite element method for the efficient numerical solution of partial differential equations posed in domains of complex shapes, using simple structured meshes, not necessarily fitted to the domain, and achieving the optimal accuracy. The only geometrical input for $\phi$-FEM is a level-set function of the domain. In this talk, we shall present a combination of $\phi$-FEM with the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) allowing for real-time predictions to be computed on any shape, with the ultimate goal of creating digital twins of human organs. We recall that CNN require a particular topological structure, in the form of a regular 2D or 3D grid. In themselves, they  are well suited for e.g. processing images. However, in our application domain, where the governing equations should be solved on domains reproducing the geometries of real organs to train the network, the requirement of a structured mesh is challenging for traditional finite element solvers. In this context, $\phi$-FEM turns out to be a promising alternative for training a CNN to provide predictions under the varying applied forces and under the varying geometries, conveniently represented by level sets that can be acquired from the medical images.

Researchers are eager to understand certain behavior and exploit powerful functions to make quantum computation more powerful and applicable. Quantum correlation contributes remarkably to speeding up algorithms by its non-negligible capability in processing massive data. Surprisingly, not only do entanglements have quantum correlations but separable states. However, quantifying the quantum correlation has been proven as an NP-hard problem, which drives us to approximate it alternatively. We consider a more general situation that turns quantifying quantum correlation into a particular case.   Through our talk, we will consider the Classical-Classical (  CC) formation to approximate quantum states in a bipartite system. The approximation problem is cast into an optimization problem that constraints on Stiefel manifolds. A Riemannian gradient-driven descent flow is established to tackle the problem.  We will finally show the objective function will decrease along the flow and successfully recover a synthetic CC state. Moreover, the consistency and convergence of the proposed method will be demonstrated via numerical results.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75462' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1707)' class='star'><span class='star1707'>&star;</span></a> Ding Lu  <span id='bitlink-2928'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2928)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2928' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2928)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hotelling Deflation and sTRLED Algorithm for Computing Many Eigenpairs</b><br />Ding Lu<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-377.html'>Advances and Challenges in Eigensolutions and Industrial Applications - Part II o II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Numerous applications in physical simulations and data analysis give rise to the need for computing many eigenpairs of large-scale Hermitian matrices. Subspace projection methods such as the Lanczos algorithm are expensive to apply directly due to the high costs of maintaining the orthogonality of a large number of projection basis vectors. To address the issue, we revisit Hotelling's explicit external deflation (EED) technique that sequentially shifts away converged eigenvalues while only maintaining a small number of basis vectors inside a subspace projection method. We first show that the EED with suitable shifts is numerically backward stable. We then introduce an eigensolver sTRLED, a combination of the EED with the s-step communication-avoiding thick-restarted Lanczos method (TRLan). sTRLED incrementally computes a batch of eigenpairs at a time and only uses a small projection subspace of TRLan. In addition, the sparse-plus-low-rank structure of the EED matrix allows for the design of specialized matrix power kernels that further reduces both communication and computation costs in sTRLED.

Here, we take advantage of modern computer hardware, and extend the original serial version to allow for multithreaded computation of Voronoi cells via the OpenMP application programming interface. We test the performance of the code, and demonstrate that we can achieve parallel efficiencies greater than 95% in many cases. The multithreaded extension follows standard OpenMP programming paradigms, allowing it to be incorporated into other programs. We provide an example of this using the VoroTop software library, performing a multithreaded Voronoi cell topology analysis of up to 102.4 million particles.

Replication offers efficiency in learning tasks that require large scale (thousands) stochastic simulations by reducing the size of the effective covariance matrix. Adaptive batching is a natural extension of sequential design heuristics with the benefit of replication growing as response features are learned, inputs concentrate, and the metamodeling overhead rises. Our algorithms propose novel acquisition functions that simultaneously determine the sequential design inputs $x^n$ and respective number of replicates $r^n$. We consider both schemes that gradually ratchet up the replication quantities $r^n$ as the number of inputs $n$ grows, and those that allocate additional replicates to existing inputs $x^k, k \le n$. Illustrations with synthetic experiments and an application in discrete-action stochastic control (learning noisily observed level sets that determine optimal actions) show that adaptive batching brings significant computational speed-ups with minimal loss of modeling fidelity.

The discretisation of such models poses significant computational challenges, both in representing discretely the structure of the original problem and the corresponding computational cost. In this work we will present recent developments in geometric integration for fluid dynamics in two dimensions. In particular, we will illustrate a recently developed efficient and scalable Lie-Poisson integrator for flows on the sphere. We will show that it is possible to design geometric integrators which conserve the Casimirs of the system at modest computational costs. The construction of such schemes, the main numerical algorithms and their parallelisation on modern supercomputing facilities will be discussed. An application to the spectrum of homogeneous two-dimensional turbulence and quasi-geostrophic turbulence will be illustrated.”    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75454' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(172)' class='star'><span class='star172'>&star;</span></a> Russell Luke  <span id='bitlink-2932'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2932)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2932' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2932)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Convexity by Randomization</b><br />Russell Luke<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-38.html'>Recent Advances in Stochastic Optimization and Computational Game Theory - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75254' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1128)' class='star'><span class='star1128'>&star;</span></a> Thibaut Lunet  <span id='bitlink-2933'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2933)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2933' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2933)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>First Steps Toward a Generic Tool for Comparing Parallel Efficiency of Iterative Parallel-in-Time Algorithms</b><br />Thibaut Lunet<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-248.html'>Parallel-in-Time Algorithms: Performance and Real-World Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>To increase parallel concurrency for the simulation of time-dependent problems, many ideas for time parallelization algorithms have been developped the last two decades. Iterative parallel-in-time (PinT) methods, like Parareal, MGRIT, and PFASST, have received the most attention.  Since those algorithms have different variants and can depend on many parameters, there is many ways for the scientific community to use them for PinT simulations. The optimal approach for one given problem is then quite difficult to determine.    
Parallel efficiency of iterative PinT algorithms relies on two aspects : the number of iterations required to get the PinT error below an acceptable level (convergence) and the computational cost for doing all those iterations, compared to a sequential simulation (speedup).  Recently, a new analysis approach has been introduced to study and compare the convergence analysis of all iterative PinT methods in a common framework. On an other side, recent research work have investigated how to compare the parallel performance of PinT methods using a common approach.  In this talk, we present our recent work in trying to merge both analysis (convergence & speedup), in order to develop a generic tool that can be used to compare the parallel performance of several PinT methods on simple problems, and provide indications on optimal approach for a given type of problem.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75574' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(584)' class='star'><span class='star584'>&star;</span></a> Dingcheng Luo  <span id='bitlink-2934'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2934)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2934' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2934)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Derivative Informed Neural Operators for PDE-Constrained Optimization under Uncertainty</b><br />Dingcheng Luo<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-128.html'>Goal-Oriented and Context-Aware Scientific Machine Learning - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>We present a novel framework for solving PDE-constrained optimization problems under uncertainty through the use of derivative informed neural operators. When optimizing the performance of systems governed by PDEs, uncertainty in the model parameters lead to  optimization under uncertainty (OUU) problems, where the optimization cost is defined in terms of risk measures of a quantity of interest. OUU problems are often orders of magnitude more expensive to solve compared to their deterministic counterparts due to the need to evaluate the risk measure by stochastic integration. This can require many evaluations of the governing PDE at every optimization iteration.    
To this end, we propose to use a reduced-basis network to approximate the PDE mapping from the input spaces of the uncertain parameter and the optimization variable to the output state, where derivative information of the PDE is used to determine the reduced-bases. We also incorporate the PDE derivatives into a Sobolev-type training loss to ensure that the neural operator has accurate derivatives with respect to the optimization variable, such that they are amenable to derivative based optimization algorithms when solving the OUU problem.  In this talk, we will discuss the construction of such neural operators and its use as surrogates for OUU. We also demonstrate its performance and computational speed-ups over a suite of numerical examples.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75415' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1476)' class='star'><span class='star1476'>&star;</span></a> Li Luo  <span id='bitlink-2935'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2935)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2935' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2935)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Nonlinear Preconditioning Strategy Based on Residual Learning for PDEs</b><br />Li Luo<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-325.html'>On the Mutual Benefit of  Machine Learning and Domain Decomposition/Multilevel Methods - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>We talk about a nonlinearly preconditioned inexact Newton method for solving highly nonlinear system of algebraic equations from the discretization of PDEs.

The LB method is based on moments of the discrete velocity distribution functions, instead of the distribution functions.  The phase-field LB method is validated by simulations of a bubble without and with buoyancy force. In particular, the dynamics of an oscillating bubble due to its initial nonequilibrium shape and a rising bubble driven by buoyancy force are simulated to compare two methods quantitatively.  Simulations of the breakup of a rising bubble and the bubble interaction with a horizontal plate are used to quantify the efficacy and efficiency of the two methods. It is observed that the phase-field LBM is more dissipative due to the nature of the diffuse-interface method used to capture the interfaces. Overall, the results obtained from both methods agree well with each other when the effects due to the numerical artifacts intrinsic to the diffuse-interface method can be neglected. Also, the LBE method is in general far more efficient and easier to parallelized.

Our work is motivated by accelerating stencil kernels through performance optimisations that exploit memory hierarchy. We focus on temporal blocking (aka time-tiling), which has long been proven beneficial for performance.  Temporal blocking reduces the required memory bandwidth of stencil computations by re-using data from the cache for multiple time steps.  However, applying temporal blocking to practical applications' stencils remains challenging.  These computations are more complex as they include sparsely located operators not aligned with the computational FD grid, like sources and receivers that perform scatter and gather operations, boundary and initial conditions, complicated physics, data dependencies and others.  Like other stencil optimisations, temporal blocking is error-prone and hard to implement by hand, requiring careful software engineering.  We present a fully-automated temporal blocking code generation through Devito, demonstrated in various applications of significant industrial interest. Devito offers a DSL to model simulations from a high-level symbolic abstraction and a compiler framework to automatically generate optimised stencil solvers.  Our implementation works in tandem with other domain-specific and compiler optimisations.  We evaluate the performance of our scheme on modern CPUs against highly-optimised stencil kernels generated by the Devito framework.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75736' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(611)' class='star'><span class='star611'>&star;</span></a> Bethany Lusch  <span id='bitlink-2938'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2938)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2938' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2938)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Benchmarking Machine Learning Methods for Reduced-Order Modeling on Large-Scale Datasets</b><br />Bethany Lusch<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-134.html'>Perspectives on Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>There are many recent advances in using machine learning for reduced-order modeling.

In order to investigate these rare structures, the gamma-rays emanating from the target must be reconstructed from recorded spectra. The partially complete spherical shells of high-purity germanium (HPGe), GRETA (GRETINA) and AGATA, represent the state-of-the-art in gamma-ray spectroscopy. GRETA is able to capture individual gamma-ray-matter interactions and their energies allowing the reconstruction of the scattered paths of individual gamma-rays that have undergone Compton scattering. However, current methods for reconstruction recover gamma-rays with an efficiency much lower than predicted and lower than older detectors (i.e., Gammasphere). Data-driven optimization using modern machine learning (ML) methods allows for more reliable separation of multiple gamma-rays and ordering of their interactions. Additionally, ML methods are used to improve existing metrics to better differentiate between high and low quality data and employ more computationally intensive methods only when needed. These methods, in conjunction a mixed integer non-linear program formulation, allow for increased efficiency of the ion-beam approaching the predicted efficiency for AGATA and GRETA as well as enabling further scientific investigations into rare isotopes.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75611' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(137)' class='star'><span class='star137'>&star;</span></a> Qiangxian Ma  <span id='bitlink-2942'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2942)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2942' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2942)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>O(N) Factorization of Dense Matrices on GPUs Without Trailing Submatrix Dependencies</b><br />Qiangxian Ma<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-30.html'>Structured Low-Rank Matrices - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>In the previous work, we demonstrated pre-computing the fill-ins and integrate them into the shared basis, allows us to remove the dependency on trailing-matrices even for $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices.

ABC replaces the likelihood computation by simulating from the underlying generative model and using the parameters corresponding to the generated observations which are &#8220;close enough' to the true data to  approximate the posterior distribution.   As a realistic test we present results of the use of an ABC algorithm to perform parameter estimation for a complex model of collective cell migration.  We consider a hybrid discrete-continuum model for the migration of a population of cells which interact with a background chemical chemoattractant field. Each individual cell acts as moving sink term reflecting the degradation of the chemoattractant through the action of membrane bound enzymes. We perform a sensitivity analysis of the model using a Morris screening approach to indicate which parameters in the model are indentifiable. Our results suggest that regardless of the algorithm used, the ABC-posterior distributions depend crucially on the value of the measurement time interval $T$ and that capturing the true parameter uncertainty of the SDE model parameters might therefore be a challenging task for ABC.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75317' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1986)' class='star'><span class='star1986'>&star;</span></a> Raj Maddipati  <span id='bitlink-2944'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2944)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2944' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2944)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Multiscale Framework for Chemical Kinetic Modeling via Reaxff and Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics: Application to Hydrogen Combustion</b><br />Raj Maddipati<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-410.html'>Models and Software for Multiscale Computational Chemistry</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>Chemical kinetics (CK) are an integral part of hierarchical multiscale modelling of combustion systems which provides reaction mechanisms and rate constants, extracted from theoretical approaches such as transition state theory and molecular dynamics (MD), to enable continuum scale simulations. To extend CK models for extreme conditions (e.g., thermochemical non-equilibrium), MD simulations based on an empirical reactive force field (reaxff-based MD: RMD) or a quantum-mechanical description (density functional theory MD: DFT-MD) to capture the atomistic interactions, has a potential to easily incorporate the necessary complexities (e.g., imposing vibrational non-equilibrium). In this work, we propose a multiscale modelling workflow using reactive MD, and validate its performance based on simple hydrogen-oxygen (HO) combustion at equilibrium conditions. For HO system, we extract the complete reaction mechanism and the statistically computed rate constants. Arrhenius parameters are then fitted for each elementary reaction and a detailed CK model is generated for hydrogen oxidation. The parametrization obtained from both the MD approaches are evaluated by computing the flame speed of a one-dimensional premixed flame in continuum scale simulations and compared against standard results. A good agreement in flames speed is obtained at different equivalence ratios, indicating the robustness of the information extracted from the MD simulations.

But access to biomedical datasets is governed by complex data usage agreements, time-consuming IRBs. One possible solution is to send models to data and develop frameworks to perform secure federated learning with privacy guarantees. In this talk I will present the Argonne Privacy Preserving Federated Learning Framework (APPFL) and adopting the framework to challenges in biomedicine.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75773' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(256)' class='star'><span class='star256'>&star;</span></a> Vince Maes  <span id='bitlink-2947'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2947)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2947' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2947)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Two-phases Hybrid Method for Modelling Neutral Particles in the Plasma Edge of a Fusion Device</b><br />Vince Maes<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-56.html'>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>In nuclear fusion reactors, neutral particles play an important role in shielding the reactor walls and in particular the divertor targets from the hot plasma in which the fusion reactions take place. The neutral particle behaviour is governed by a kinetic equation that is difficult to solve due to the high dimensionality of the phase space and the high collisionality between the neutral particles and the plasma. High dimensionality is typically resolved by resorting to Monte Carlo methods, but in high collisional regimes a pure Monte Carlo solver becomes intractable. To reduce the computational cost, recent research focuses on hybrid fluid/particle methods that exploit the high-collisionality of the system.    
In this talk, we elaborate on a new hybrid fluid/particle method that splits the particle distribution in two phases: a fluid phase and a particle phase. The particle phase is solved using a Monte Carlo scheme, the fluid phase follows a reduced fluid model that is derived from the kinetic equation in the high collisional limit. The two phases co-exist in the whole domain, but the amount of mass in each phase is determined by the local collisionality. This way, the amount of particles treated with Monte Carlo is reduced in high collisional regimes, where the cost of Monte Carlo is high, but the reduced fluid model is accurate. In low collisional regimes where the reduced fluid model is not accurate, but Monte Carlo is cheap, most of the mass is in the particle phase.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75290' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(877)' class='star'><span class='star877'>&star;</span></a> Matteo Maestri  <span id='bitlink-2948'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2948)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2948' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2948)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structure-Dependent Multiscale Analysis in Heterogeneous Catalysis</b><br />Matteo Maestri<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-192.html'>Stochastic and Multiscale Modeling Approaches for Interfacial Systems - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Multiscale analyses based on structure-dependent microkinetic modeling are acknowledged to be an essential key tool to achieve a detailed mechanistic understanding of the catalyst functionality as they bridge the micro-scale environment of the active site and the macroscale reaction environment. Here, we present a methodology to perform a structure-dependent microkinetic analysis of a catalytic process. The methodology makes it possible to unveil the nature and identity of the active site in a self-consistent manner. The methodology is based on the combination of microkinetic modeling and ab initio thermodynamics with Wulff constructions and Boltzmann statistics at given conditions of chemical potential in the reactor. In doing so, the structure and the coordination geometry of each atom at the catalyst surface are determined. Then, microkinetic analyses are performed on the distribution of the sites in order to unravel the identity of the active site during the reaction. Selected examples in the context of water-gas-shift, reverse-water-gas shift, and CO2 methanation on metal catalysts will be employed as showcases. As a whole, this methodology makes it possible a concomitant description of the nature of the catalyst material in reaction conditions and of its catalytic consequences in terms of reactivity. As such, it paves the way towards the use of first-principles methods for the interpretation of the experimental evidence in terms of structure-activity relationships.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75498' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(527)' class='star'><span class='star527'>&star;</span></a> Luca Magri  <span id='bitlink-2949'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2949)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2949' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2949)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Interpretable Nonlinear Reduced-Order Modelling with Autoencoders</b><br />Luca Magri<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-115.html'>Reduced-Complexity Models for Fluid Flows - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Autoencoders are machine-learning methods that enable a reduced- order representation of data. They consist of an encoder, which compresses the data in a latent space, and a decoder, which decompresses the data back to the original space. If only linear operations are performed during the encoding and decoding phases, an autoencoder can learn the principal components of the data. On the other hand, if nonlinear activations functions are employed, an autoencoder learns a nonlinear model of the data in the latent space.    
The interpretability of the latent space, however, is not yet fully established. In this work, we physically interpret the latent space with simple tools from differential geometry. The interpretation is employed on canonical turbulent flows, i.e., the Kolmogorov flow and the minimal flow unit. The results show that the autoencoder learns the optimal submanifold in which the reduced-order dynamics is well represented. The latent variables are exploited for reducing the model's complexity whilst keeping optimal accuracy on the spatiotemporal dynamics. This work opens opportunities for extracting physical insight from the latent space and for nonlinear model reduction.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75391' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1291)' class='star'><span class='star1291'>&star;</span></a> Vijay S.

Rigorous spatial coupling between components in such systems involves field transformations, and communication of data across multiresolution grids, while preserving key attributes of interest such as global integrals and local features, which is usually referred to as the process of "remapping". Such remap procedures are critical in ensuring stability and accuracy of scientific codes simulating multiphysics problems that typically occur in many different scientific domains such as Fluid-Structure interaction, nuclear reactor analysis, magneto-hydrodynamics modeling, and Climate and Weather simulations to name a few.     
Improper treatment of the coupled solution terms in multiphysics simulations can lead to large inaccuracies that can propagate and destroy the overall accuracy and stability of the numerical computation.  Since solution transfer between different discretizations of the domain plays a critical role here, we introduce an infrastructure based on the MOAB unstructured mesh library to handle field projections to recover high-order accuracy in a scalable way, while preserving key remapping metrics of interest for various applications.

Such a diffraction problem can be studied by solving the Maxwell equations numerically. Diffraction anomalies such as zero reflection, zero transmission and perfect absorption may arise for incident waves with specific frequencies and/or wavevectors, and these phenomena can be used to manipulate electromagnetic waves and light. The frequencies and wavevectors of anomalies are discretely distributed in the spectrum, and some anomalies may appear only in structures with specific physical parameters. Existing methods for computing anomalies are usually computationally expensive and not very effective, as they require repeatedly solving a boundary value problem for many parameter values. In this study, a number of diffraction anomalies are computed using an efficient numerical method based on nonlinear eigenvalue formulations and a contour-integral method (for solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problems). To demonstrate the new method, numerical examples for structures with periodic arrays of cylinders are provided.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75824' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1324)' class='star'><span class='star1324'>&star;</span></a> Matthias Maier  <span id='bitlink-2952'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2952)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2952' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2952)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Robust and Efficient Approximation of the Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations</b><br />Matthias Maier<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-292.html'>Robust Finite Element Methods for Convection-Diffusion Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Structure preserving numerical methods provide theoretical guarantees of reliability for situations where ad-hoc stabilization techniques can fail.

Examples range from the transport of biofilm streamers through porous media to the design of sorting devices for DNA molecules. For large number of such problems, the dynamics of the fibers result from the complex interplay between internal elastic stresses, contact forces and hydrodynamic interactions with the walls and obstacles. By means of numerical simulations, experiments and analytical predictions, we investigate the dynamics of flexible fibers settling in a viscous fluid embedded with obstacles of arbitrary shapes. We show that, for a single fiber, the fiber's deformation, orientation, velocity and trajectory are strongly altered by its properties and the presence of the obstacle. We introduce a numerical model to capture the aforementioned changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We identify and characterize two types of events : trapping and gliding, the former involves nontrivial trapping conformations on sharp obstacles, and the latter, a lateral dispersion. We show how these effects can be leveraged to propose a new strategy to sort fibers based on their size and/or elasticity.

One of the main issues in this framework is the selection of the stepsize: classical globalization strategies such as linesearch are not feasible in the multi-agent setting, while employing a fixed stepsize is known to often cause the method to be slow, and usually requires the knowledge of the regularity constants of the problem, which can be hard to estimate distributedly. We propose a distributed Inexact Newton method that combines the penalty formulation of the problem with Jacobi Overrelaxation method, and uses an adaptive stepsize that can be computed without a priori knowedge of the constants of the problem. Under suitbale regularity assumptions over the objective function and on the connectivity of the underlying network, we prove both global and local fast convergence of the proposed method, with convergence order that depends on the choice of the parameters of the method. We also presents a set of numerical results that shows the comparison between the proposed algorithm and several methods from the literature.

While these complementary approaches typically require different computing technologies (traditional HPC vs GPU computing for machine learning), both of them often need an additional level of high-throughput computing (HTC) to achieve meaningful results.    
In the case of modeling and simulation approaches, an important step in development of models which can be translated into clinical practice, is the verification, validation and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ). This process requires running the model with a large number of parameters, which calls for high-throughput computing. In the case of AI-based models, the typical HTC workload results from hyperparameter optimization in machine learning, architecture search in deep neural networks, or large-scale studies in federated learning. Finally, the models in computational medicine can be used to run large studies called in-silico trials, which aim to experiment with various models and treatment strategies on a set of real or virtual patients. Examples of the tools which support such studies on HPC and cloud environments are the Model Execution Environment or CloudVVUQ library.

It is advantageous if such a framework stems from a simple and elegant general idea. Implicit constitutive theory of materials provides such a framework: while being built upon simple ideas, it is able to capture experimental observations with the minimum  number of physical quantities involved. It also provides theoretical justification in the full three-dimensional setting for various models that were previously proposed in an ad hoc manner. From the perspective of the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and corresponding numerical methods, implicit constitutive theory leads to new classes of challenging mathematical problems.

A mapping function is used to provide information about the local direction of the anisotropy, with one of the global coordinates chosen to parameterize the ‘parallel’ position along the mapping in a one-to-one manner. Nodes are arranged on succesive planes of constant parallel coordinate with fine spacing on each plane necessary to represent the small-scale variations perpendicular to the mapping direction, but with large spacings then possible between these planes because of the small variation along the mapping. This greatly reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to represent highly-anisotropic fields in this space and the associated computational cost of simulations involving such fields. The use of standard unstructured finite element meshes on each plane is explored, as well as fully-meshfree arrangements. No mesh connectivity is defined between planes in either case, and field-aligned basis functions are constructed using the mapping function to extend the bases into the full domain. Integration of the bases is addressed using variationally consistent integration (VCI), and the scheme (as well as other EFG schemes) is shown to be locally conservative under certain conditions. Robust convergence of several test problems is demonstrated.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75453' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(119)' class='star'><span class='star119'>&star;</span></a> Alexander V.

The unknown medium is probed with pulses and the time domain pressure waveform data is recorded on an active array of sensors. The ROM, a projection of the wave equation operator is constructed from the data via a nonlinear process and is used for efficient velocity estimation. While the conventional FWI via nonlinear least-squares data fitting is challenging without low frequency information, and prone to getting stuck in local minima (cycle skipping), minimization of ROM misfit is behaved much better, even for a poor initial guess. For low-dimensional parametrizations of the unknown velocity the ROM misfit function is close to convex. The proposed approach consistently outperforms conventional FWI in standard synthetic tests.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75237' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1920)' class='star'><span class='star1920'>&star;</span></a> Rahul Manavalan  <span id='bitlink-2964'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2964)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2964' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2964)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Full Waveform Inversion Using Fourier Neural Operators and An Adversarial Regularization Network</b><br />Rahul Manavalan<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(533)' class='star'><span class='star533'>&star;</span></a> Stephan Mandt  <span id='bitlink-2965'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2965)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2965' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2965)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Latent Variable Perspective on Climate Model Intercomparisons</b><br />Stephan Mandt<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-116.html'>Data Science Solutions for Earth Sciences – a Path to a Sustainable Future - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75392' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(35)' class='star'><span class='star35'>&star;</span></a> Michael Mandulak  <span id='bitlink-2966'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2966)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2966' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2966)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Vertex Ordering Refinement and Coarsening Methods for Accelerated Graph Analysis</b><br />Michael Mandulak<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-8.html'>Scaling Data Science, AI, and, ML on Massively Multi-Threaded Systems - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Vertex ordering and graph coarsening are critical topics within large-scale graph analysis towards efficient memory access patterns through vertex locality improvements and graph size reduction, respectively, in a distributed setting. Subsequently, modern ordering schemes show inefficiencies through heuristic-based solutions and, when coupled with coarsening methods, can be runtime inefficient, especially as real-world networks continue to grow. Thus, we conduct an experimental study focused on the combination of ordering and coarsening methods with respect to the algebraic distance metric. We additionally propose a framework implementing our coarsening method on the GPU alongside the CPU shared-memory parallel explicit refinement of vertex labels relative to analysis measures. We show improvements in cache misses and analysis runtimes for the PageRank, Louvain and Multistep connectivity algorithms on a variety of different graph topologies and sizes. Through these results, we demonstrate the potential of joint parallel ordering and coarsening methods on large-scale networks for improved analysis measures.

Within this work we introduce a new method, which is a generalization of the recent physics-based reduction frameworks. The generalized method is driven by operator inference method and adjoint methods. That way the unconstrained problem can be learned from data stemming from black-box models, whereas the contact behavior is reproduced within the adjoint system describing the Lagrange multipliers, i.e., the variables that enforce the contact conditions.   	    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75443' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(558)' class='star'><span class='star558'>&star;</span></a> Andrea Manzoni  <span id='bitlink-2972'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2972)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2972' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2972)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Real-Time Simulation of Parameter-Dependent Fluid Flows Through Deep Learning-Based Reduced Order Models</b><br />Andrea Manzoni<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-122.html'>Model Order Reduction Methods for Parameterized Fluid Flows - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Simulating fluid flows in different virtual scenarios is of key importance towards the design of predictive digital twins in computational fluid dynamics. Compared to high-fidelity, full-order models, reduced order models (ROMs) relying, e.g., on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provide reliable approximations to parameter-dependent fluid dynamics problems in rapid times. However, they might require expensive hyper-reduction strategies for handling nonlinear terms, and enriched reduced spaces if a mixed velocity-pressure formulation is considered, possibly hampering the evaluation of reliable solutions in real-time. Dealing with fluid-structure interactions entails even greater difficulties. We propose a new class of deep learning (DL)-based ROMs that overcome all these limitations by learning, in a nonintrusive way, both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics. To do so, they rely on deep neural networks, such as convolutional autoencoders and deep feedforward neural networks, after performing a former dimensionality reduction through POD that enhances training times substantially. Moreover, including long short-term memory (LSTM) cells enables long-term prediction of complex systems’ evolution, with respect to the training window, for unseen input parameter values. Numerical results show the capability of POD-DL-ROMs to provide accurate results, in real-time, in multiple contexts, ranging from haemodynamics to fluid-structure interaction problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75410' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1982)' class='star'><span class='star1982'>&star;</span></a> Raed A.

In this talk, I will focus on the convergence of operator networks  that approximate the solution operator of linear elliptic PDEs. I  will, in particular, consider operator networks that, given a fixed  right-hand side, map sets of diffusion-reaction coefficients into the  space of solutions (coefficient-to-solution map).  When the  coefficients are smooth and with periodic boundary conditions, the  size of the networks can be bounded with respect to the $H^1$ norm of  the error, uniformly over the parameter set. Specifically, the number  of non zero weights grows at most poly-logarithmically with respect to  the error. The proofs of our approximation rates combine elliptic  regularity, classical and recent results in numerical analysis, and  tools from NN approximation theory. Using the same techniques, we  extend the analysis to linear elasticity and parametric problems.

A common problem for GPs is the ill-conditioning of their covariance matrix, particularly when the popular Gaussian kernel is used. For gradient-free GPs, a modest nugget can be added to the diagonal of the covariance matrix to ensure its condition number is below a user-set threshold. Unfortunately, it is problematic to apply this method on its own for gradient-enhanced GPs since it can require a large nugget, which is detrimental to the accuracy of the GP. A novel method has been developed that guarantees that the condition number of the gradient-enhanced Gaussian kernel covariance matrix remains below a user-set threshold. This is achieved by using non-isotropic rescaling for the data and a modest nugget. This method is straightforward to implement, non-intrusive, applicable to problems of any dimension, and it allows all data to be kept. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, a Bayesian optimizer is used with and without this method. With this novel method, the optimizer does not encounter any ill-conditioned covariance matrices and the optimality is converged several orders of magnitude deeper than the base case.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75371' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(413)' class='star'><span class='star413'>&star;</span></a> Roummel F.

We propose a new trust-region method whose subproblem is defined using a so-called “shape-changing” norm together with densely-initialized multipoint symmetric secant (MSS) matrices to approximate the Hessian. Shape-changing norms and dense initializations have been successfully used in the context of traditional quasi-Newton methods, but have yet to be explored in the case of MSS methods. Numerical results suggest that trust-region methods that use densely-initialized MSS matrices together with shape-changing norms outperform MSS with other trust-region methods.	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75360' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1075)' class='star'><span class='star1075'>&star;</span></a> Jacopo Marconi  <span id='bitlink-2978'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2978)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2978' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2978)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Sensitivity Analysis of Frequency Response Curves Using a Parametric Reduced Order Model and Harmonic Balance</b><br />Jacopo Marconi<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-236.html'>Recent Advances in Nonlinear Model Reduction for Computational Mechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>In MEMS industry, designers often resort the large FE models to characterize new devices. This process is computationally cumbersome, even more so when dealing with nonlinearities due to large deformations. On top of this, as MEMS production processes lead to considerable geometric imperfections, the performance spread of each device must be assessed during the design phase. A popular way to do so is the Monte Carlo method, but it requires thousands of simulations. To alleviate the computational burden of these repeated nonlinear analyses, not be feasible in practice, we recently developed a parametric ROM for shape defects in the geometry. Using the Harmonic Balance method (HB), we were able to compute Frequency Response Curves (FRC) in the matter of minutes. However, even if way more efficient than running the full order model, repeating these simulations thousands of times is still unacceptable. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a HB Sensitivity Analysis, which approximates the nominal solution (i.e. without defects) with a Taylor series. This way, after the nominal solution and the sensitivities are computed, the FRC for each new parameter realization will be given simply through an update. Different strategies to achieve this goal are discussed on a simple nonlinear oscillator, with special care for the closure equation required for the well-posedness of the problem. Finally, the computational benefits of the method are assessed on a FE model of a MEMS device.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75559' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1870)' class='star'><span class='star1870'>&star;</span></a> Christopher Marcotte  <span id='bitlink-2979'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2979)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2979' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2979)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reconstructing Unobserved Cardiac Excitations from Experimental Recordings using Data Assimilation</b><br />Christopher Marcotte<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1961)' class='star'><span class='star1961'>&star;</span></a> Fabio Marcuzzi  <span id='bitlink-2980'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2980)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2980' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2980)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Material Changes As Fictitious Heat Sources in Inverse Heat Transfer Problems</b><br />Fabio Marcuzzi<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(669)' class='star'><span class='star669'>&star;</span></a> Nils Margenberg  <span id='bitlink-2981'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2981)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2981' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2981)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Hybrid Finite Element / Neural Network Method for the Navier-Stokes Equations</b><br />Nils Margenberg<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-147.html'>Scientific Machine Learning and Data-Driven Techniques in Complex Multi-Physics Systems  - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>In this talk we discuss the use of deep neural networks for augmenting classical  finite element simulations in fluid-dynamics.    
Classical simulation methods often reach their limits. Even if the finite  element method is highly efficient and established for the discretization of the  Navier-Stokes equations, fundamental problems, such as the resolution of fine  structures or a correct information transport between scales, are still not  sufficiently solved.    
We discuss approaches to connect the finite element method with neural networks  to overcome these obstacles. The paradigm is to use classical simulation  techniques where their strengths are eminent, such as in the efficient  representation of a coarse, large-scale flow field. Neural networks are used  where a full resolution of the effects does not seem possible or efficient. The  Deep Neural Network Multigrid Solver takes up these ideas by combining a  geometric multigrid solver and a deep neural network. We show the efficiency,  generalizability and scalability by 2D and 3D simulations. We introduce an approach to retrain the network adaptively based on the uncertainty of the predictions.     
Based on extensions of the Deep Neural Network Multigrid Solver we offer  perspectives on how finite element simulations can benefit from neural networks in the future. In addition to the desired  increase in efficiency, the focus is particularly on issues of stability,  generalizability and error accuracy.

The signed distance is advantageous for the phase indicator computation that relies on algebraic Heaviside function models. Traditionally, the signed-distance property was also motivated by simplified curvature computation and for stabilizing the numerical differentiation. We propose to use a geometrical computation of the zero level-set for the phase indication and the curvature approximation. This approach was disregarded initially for the level set method because of computational costs; however, recent advances in the geometrical computation of volume fractions for the unstructured Volume-of-Fluid method provide high-speed intersection algorithms for non-convex polyhedrons. Our approach omits re-distancing (that amplifies mass loss) while relying on compact-stencil unstructured Finite-Volume discretization of the Level Set equation. The method is sufficiently volume-conservative and accurately advects the phase indicator, while its straightforward equation discretization and efficient geometrical phase indicator deliver a high degree of (parallel) computational efficiency.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75606' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1040)' class='star'><span class='star1040'>&star;</span></a> Erika Maringova  <span id='bitlink-2983'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2983)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2983' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2983)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On Mathematical Foundations for Implicitly Constituted Fluids with Implicitly Constituted Boundary Conditions</b><br />Erika Maringova<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-228.html'>Modeling and Computation for Implicitly Constituted Materials: Fluids, Solids, Plasmas, and Mixtures - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>We study systems of nonlinear partial differential equations of parabolic type, in which the elliptic operator is replaced by the first order divergence operator acting on a flux function, which is related to the spatial gradient of the unknown through an additional implicit equation.

We then establish the global-in-time and large-data existence of a (weak) solution and its uniqueness. The theory is tractable from the point of view of numerical approximations.

The size of these matrices can be in the (tens of) billions, which require efficient algorithms and implementations on current HPC platforms.  Many-Fermion Dynamics—nuclear (MFDn) is a CI code that obtains the lowest eigenpairs in large-scale ab-initio nuclear physics calculations, using either a Lanczos iterative eigensolver or Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) solver.  Rapid convergence of the iterative LOBPCG algorithm is achieved by a suitable initialization in combination with an efficient (both in term of convergence and in terms of computational cost) preconditioner.    
MFDn is a hybrid MPI/OpenMP Fortran 95 code, with OpenACC for GPU offloading.  I discuss some of the challenges and solutions for an efficient GPU implementation, and its performance on Perlmutter at NERSC.  For large-scale calculations, data movement and in particular inter-node communication becomes a bottleneck, both with the Lanczos algorithm and with LOBPCG.  On GPU systems, we have therefore also implemented a matrix-free version of the solver; furthermore, we are exploring the feasibility of compressing (and decompressing) the vectors in order to reduce the MPI overhead.

In this talk we discuss how to efficiently represent complex geometries by reconstructing signed distance functions using bounding volume hierarchies.

Many quantum computing algorithms have been proposed with this goal in mind, with a focus on Hamiltonian eigenvalue extraction, a problem central to chemistry, physics, and materials science. However, the majority of established quantum algorithms require a prohibitively large number of resources for near-term hardware. Here we show that quantum algorithms relying on real-time evolution for energy eigenvalue determination, which we refer to as variational quantum phase estimation (VQPE), represent an optimal solution for this challenge. Real-time evolution is native to quantum hardware, making these algorithms particularly suited for the near term. Additionally, using a novel transformation we prove that we can drastically reduce the number of measurements needed from quadratic to linear, marking this a significant improvement over previous quantum algorithms based on time evolution. We show that remarkably few time evolution steps, computed on quantum hardware, are needed to converge both ground and excited state energies to experimentally meaningful accuracies. We demonstrate the power of this approach classically on a paradigmatic example of strong correlation, the Cr2 dimer, as well as on quantum hardware for the transverse field Ising model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75873' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1169)' class='star'><span class='star1169'>&star;</span></a> Daniel Martin  <span id='bitlink-2990'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2990)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2990' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2990)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Solver Improvements for Ice Sheets and Adaptive Mesh Refinement</b><br />Daniel Martin<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-256.html'>Advanced Solvers for Geophysical Flows</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>The BISICLES ice sheet model (Cornford et al, 2013) employs adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to efficiently resolve relatively fine dynamical features like grounding lines and ice streams.

We explore how to combine data sets to quantify uncertainty in the learned models, and at the same time draw mechanistic conclusions about the target differential equations. We generate noisy data using a stochastic agent-based model and combine equation learning methods with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to show that the correct differential equation model can be successfully learned from data, while a quantification of uncertainty is given by a posterior distribution in parameter space.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75299' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(945)' class='star'><span class='star945'>&star;</span></a> Irving Martinez  <span id='bitlink-2992'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2992)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2992' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2992)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Steklov-Poincar&#233; Analysis of the Basic Three-Domain Stent Problem</b><br />Irving Martinez<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-206.html'>Numerical Simulation of Bio-Inspired Fluid-Structure Interaction - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>The Steklov-Poincaré problem was previously considered in the artery lumen and wall setting with a single interface. Here the analysis is expanded to incorporate solute behavior in the presence of a fixed-volume, solid, simple stent. In this geometry, a third domain is added to the two-domain structure of wall and artery. Through this intersecting domain volume setting there are three interfaces: lumen-wall, stent-lumen, and wall-stent.     
  Steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are used to explain the behavior of blood through the lumen, while advection-diffusion dynamics are considered for the solute mechanics across the lumen, wall, and stent. Having a fixed blood velocity value, Steklov-Poincar\'e decomposition of the advection-diffusion equations is applied locally to each of the interfaces. To unify these instances on a global scale, their overall intersection is explored in a smaller manifold, reducing the problem to one previously solved by Quarteroni, Veneziani, and Zunino.  Through finite element analysis (FEM), the solution is discretized and found to be convergent. Finally, computational simulations of different types of stent of one, three, and five stent rings of different thickness, placed between straight and curved volumes of inner and outer cylindrical meshes, were performed using NGSolve, confirming the convergence of the solution and its relation to the coarseness of the mesh.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75517' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(109)' class='star'><span class='star109'>&star;</span></a> Leandro Mart&#237;nez  <span id='bitlink-2993'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(2993)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-2993' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(2993)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High Performance Particle Simulations and Simulation Analysis Tools with CELLLISTMAP.JL</b><br />Leandro Mart&#237;nez<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-24.html'>Research Software Engineering with Julia - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>N-body simulations and trajectory analysis rely on the calculation of attributes that depend on pairwise particle distances within a cutoff. Interparticle potential energies, forces, distribution functions, neighbor lists, and distance-dependent distributions, for example, must be calculated. Cell lists are widely used to avoid computing distances outside the cutoff. However, efficient cell list implementations are difficult to customize. Here, we provide a fast and parallel implementation of cell lists in Julia that allows the mapping of custom functions dependent on particle positions in 2 or 3 dimensions. Arbitrary periodic boundary conditions are supported. Automatic differentiation and unit propagation can be used. The implementation provides a framework for the development of new analysis tools and simulations with custom potentials. The performance of resulting computations is comparable to state-of-the-art implementations of neighbor list algorithms and cell lists, available in specialized software. Examples are provided for the computation of potential energies, forces, distribution of pairwise velocities, neighbor lists and other typical calculations in molecular and astrophysical simulations. The Julia package is freely available at http://m3g.github.io/CellListMap.jl. Interfacing with Python and R with minimal overhead is possible.

The democratization of deep learning capabilities has contributed to a wealth of applications in various fields of our society. Data scientists have used this new instrument to become magicians for the experts in industry for which the first-time-right design of new products and the efficient operation of their manufacturing plants has become more and more complex.  Digital Twins on the other hand have become a generic name for everything that can help the product developer or manufacturing owner to simulate the complex behavior of product or process and optimize it using a virtual variant, allowing to evaluate a much larger space of possible solutions. The challenge however, is that the creation of such advanced digital twins requires expertise which is not easily available.  In this session the author will show through a series of examples how AI is used to capture the experience of the engineers in product development and accelerate the product development process. More-over, through AI, the usage of digital twins can be facilitated beyond product development and support plant operators to optimize manufacturing for reduced energy, improved quality and reduced waste. Finally the session will give an outlook on the availability for low-code AI solutions will make its usage also available to engineers and not just limits it to the data scientists of this world.

Stacking varying materials on top of each other allows for a vast range of possible materials and corresponding properties. However, this stacking typically leads to an aperiodic, or incommensurate, material due to lattice mismatch or rotational misalignment. These incommensurate patterns increases the potential for tunability of electronic and mechanical properties, leading for example to the famous discovery of unconventional superconductivity of twisted bilayer graphene at the famous magic angle.    
In this work, we discuss configuration and momentum space methodologies to build algorithms for computing observables and quasi-band structure of incommensurate heterostuctures for ab-initio tight-binding models. We exploit the ergodicity of the misalignment, and for appropriate materials (such as those with conic or parabolic bands) we use carefully selected perturbative expansions in momentum space with a thorough error analysis describing the effects of the large moire scale felt strongly through the mechanical relaxation patterns.

However, FWI is notorious for local-minimum trapping, or "cycle skipping," and thus requires an accurate initial model ([Métivier et al., Optimal transport for mitigating cycle skipping in full-waveform inversion]). Cycle skipping is caused by the nonconvex nature of the misfit optimization landscape in a least-squares formulation. In contrast, the Wasserstein-2 distance, denoted $W_2$, is convex with respect to shifts and dilations, which occur naturally in seismic data ([Engquist et al. Optimal transport for seismic full waveform inversion]). Therefore, we propose using this optimal-transport metric as our misfit for source inversion. Previous work using optimal transport for source inversion has shown promise ([Chen et al., The quadratic Wasserstein distance for earthquake location]). However, this work uses the acoustic wave equation, which is less accurate than an elastic model. In this talk, we extend these results to elastic source inversion in two spatial dimensions and show that they translate well to the elastic model. We will show a comparison of the optimization landscapes with respect to source location for the $L^2$ misfit and $W_2$ distance for the IASP-91 model. We then show inversion results using USArray data from the western United States for various earthquake sources, assuming known Lamé parameters.

Such systems are often equipped with some energy functional that decays with time, which is important in that it controls asymptotic behavior of solutions.    
The energy decay property could be preserved by &#8220;structure-preserving numerical methods." They are preferable for better qualitative behaviors, but in many cases schemes become fully-implicit, and prohibitive as is for large systems.  It encourages us to introduce some model reduction techniques (for example, the proper orthogonal decomposition [Moore, 1981]), but it in turn generally destroys the important mathematical structure, the gradient structure, which makes the overall strategy very problematic.    
In this talk, we show a new structure-preserving model reduction technique for dissipative gradient systems, which successfully preserves the gradient structure.  The technique is partially inspired by an existing technique for Hamiltonian systems (without friction) [Peng--Mohseni, 2016], but provides more general guiding principle for structure-preservation.  With some numerical examples we illustrate that in fact such a structure-preserving model reduction provides us efficient, stable numerical computations.

This problem becomes especially challenging when the system of interest exhibits shocks or chaotic dynamics. We present a data-driven modeling method that accurately captures shocks and chaotic dynamics by proposing a novel architecture, the stabilized neural ordinary differential equation (ODE). Here we learn the right hand side of an ODE by adding the outputs of two neural networks (NN) together where one learns a linear term and the other a nonlinear term. Specifically, we implement this by training a sparse linear convolutional NN to learn the linear term and a dense fully-connected nonlinear NN to learn the nonlinear term. This is in contrast with the standard neural ODE which involves training only a single NN for learning the RHS. Our method is applied for learning the viscous Burgers and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations where we outperform the standard variant not only in terms of metrics but also in terms of the capture of key physical characteristics such as discontinuities in the former and chaotic invariant manifolds in the latter.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75499' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1395)' class='star'><span class='star1395'>&star;</span></a> Aimee Maurais  <span id='bitlink-3005'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3005)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3005' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3005)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Riemannian Multifidelity Covariance Estimation from Statistically Coupled Observations</b><br />Aimee Maurais<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-307.html'>Recent Advances in Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>We present a framework for multifidelity covariance estimation from statistically coupled pairs of high- and low-fidelity random variables. We define a multifidelity covariance estimator as the solution to a regression problem on tangent spaces to product manifolds of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. Given a set of high- and low-fidelity sample covariance matrices, viewed as a sample of a product-manifold-valued random variable, we estimate the underlying true covariance matrices by minimizing a notion of squared Mahalanobis distance between the data and a model for its variation about its mean. This estimator can be employed using any Riemannian geometry for the SPD manifold and reduces to control variates in the chosen geometry when all low-fidelity optimization variables are fixed. We particularly focus on the affine-invariant SPD manifold geometry, under which multifidelity covariance regression estimates are guaranteeably positive definite and the Mahalanobis distance has desirable properties. We demonstrate under three geometries that our estimator can provide significant reductions in MSE relative to single-fidelity covariance estimators. This framework is relevant to the data assimilation setting, which often requires repeated evaluation of expensive high-fidelity forecast models, and particularly applicable to the ensemble Kalman filter, in which covariances must be computed from forecast model evaluations in order to perform the analysis step.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75692' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1119)' class='star'><span class='star1119'>&star;</span></a> Alexandre Mauroy  <span id='bitlink-3006'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3006)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3006' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3006)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Data-Driven Approach to Stability Using the Koopman Operator</b><br />Alexandre Mauroy<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-246.html'>Recent Advances in Data-Driven Control of Complex Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>The Koopman operator offers a linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems. This opens the door to systematic methods for global stability analysis, since global stability properties of nonlinear systems can be directly inferred from the linear stability analysis of the operator. Moreover, the Koopman operator framework is amenable to data-driven analysis, in the sense that a finite-dimensional approximation of the (infinite-dimensional) Koopman operator can be inferred from data (e.g. EDMD method). In this talk, we will leverage this framework to provide a novel method for data-driven stability analysis. In particular, we construct a candidate Lyapunov function for the data-driven approximation of the operator and estimate its validity region from the data. This allows to derive stability guarantees and compute an inner approximation of the attraction region in a purely data-driven fashion. The method will be illustrated with several examples and the use of the probabilistic scenario approach will be discussed in the case of high-dimensional systems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75572' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(106)' class='star'><span class='star106'>&star;</span></a> Natalie T.

However, optimization over molecules is challenging since the objective function is defined over the discrete and structured space of all possible molecules. Latent space Bayesian optimization (LS-BO) has recently emerged as a promising approach for optimizing over such search spaces. In LS-BO, a deep autoencoder model (DAE) maps molecules into a continuous latent space where familiar Bayesian optimization tools can be more readily applied. While recent work in this area has made rapid progress on the design of better DAEs for this task, relatively little attention has been paid to the optimization component. This is problematic, as the DAEs used typically have high dimensional latent spaces, which significantly degrades the performance of traditional Bayesian optimization algorithms. To address this issue, we develop a novel method to adapt recent work on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization to the LS-BO setting.

This has also facilitated the introduction of an unfitted version of the method that further reduced the constraints on node positioning and helped alleviate problems with skewed stencils near domain boundaries.    
In this talk an application of oversampled RBF-FD methods to problems in nonlinear solid mechanics will be presented, motivated by the desire to produce a meshless numerical model for the  human diaphragm.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75599' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(999)' class='star'><span class='star999'>&star;</span></a> Ondrej Maxian  <span id='bitlink-3009'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3009)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3009' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3009)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Spectral Discretization for Fluctuating Fiber Hydrodynamics</b><br />Ondrej Maxian<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-219.html'>Computational Techniques for Brownian Motion in Complex Suspensions</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>Semiflexible filaments are ubiquitous in nature and cell biology, including in the cytoskeleton, where reorganization of actin filaments allows the cell to move and divide. Most methods for simulating semiflexible bending fluctuations are based on worm-like chain models, which become prohibitively expensive in the slender limit when computing hydrodynamics. In this talk, we develop a novel approach for simulating fluctuating slender filaments. Our numerical method is based on using a non-uniform spectral discretization of the filament centerline combined with a spectrally-accurate &#8220;slender-body' quadrature for hydrodynamics. We apply our method to simulate equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of semiflexible fibers, and conclude by analyzing the role of semiflexible fluctuations in actin filament bundling.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75537' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(69)' class='star'><span class='star69'>&star;</span></a> Sandra May  <span id='bitlink-3010'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3010)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3010' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3010)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>DoD Stabilization for Solving Hyperbolic Conservation Laws on Cut Cell Meshes</b><br />Sandra May<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-15.html'>Structure Preserving and Robust Techniques for the Simulation of Transport Phenomena and Fluid Flows - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>Cut cells methods have been developed in recent years for computing flow around bodies with complicated geometries. For mesh generation, the flow body is cut out of a regular Cartesian grid resulting in so called cut cells. Cut cells can have irregular shape and may be very small. For the solution of time-dependent hyperbolic conservation laws, this causes the small cell problem: explicit time stepping schemes are not stable on the arbitrarily small cut cells.    
In this talk we present the Domain of Dependence (DoD) stabilization for overcoming this issue for DG schemes. The stabilization is based on adding suitable penalty terms to the spatial discretization. In time, one can then use a standard explicit time stepping scheme. The terms are designed to restore proper domains of dependence. The terms are constructed such that the resulting stabilized scheme possesses desirable properties such as being monotone for scalar conservation laws for the first-order version or energy preserving for the semi-discrete scheme for all polynomial degrees. On cut cell meshes, this is a big challenge to guarantee these otherwise `standard' properties. In this talk, we will present the idea behind the DoD stabilization and summarize the latest developments for non-linear problems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75208' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(265)' class='star'><span class='star265'>&star;</span></a> Viktoria Mayer  <span id='bitlink-3011'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3011)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3011' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3011)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>How to Recover from Node Failures in s-step Conjugate Gradient Methods</b><br />Viktoria Mayer<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-58.html'>Scalable and Efficient Linear Solvers for Large Real-World Applications</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>With the massive growth of concurrency in large-scale computer systems, global communication becomes a major bottleneck and the likelihood of component failures increases. The Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method is an iterative solver for large sparse linear systems facing these challenges. To reduce the number of global synchronizations by a factor of O(s), communication-avoiding s-step PCG methods compute the iterations of PCG in blocks of s.    
Our focus is on resilience against node failures, for which the commonly used approach is periodically saving the state of the solver (Checkpoint-Restart). Other approaches exploit algorithm-specific properties to achieve scalable resilience on large-scale parallel computers. During the failure-free phase of resilient PCG, a small part of the state’s data can be stored redundantly by exploiting the inherent data redundancy in each iteration. In the event of node failures, the lost parts of the state are recovered using an exact state reconstruction (ESR) strategy after retrieving this redundantly stored data.    
We incorporate resilience against multiple node failures in two s-step PCG methods using ESR ideas and illustrate very low overhead compared to the non-resilient methods. By providing theoretical and experimental evaluations, we confirm that the communication-avoiding properties and therefore scalability of the s-step PCG methods are preserved.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75293' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(770)' class='star'><span class='star770'>&star;</span></a> Chris Maynard  <span id='bitlink-3012'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3012)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3012' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3012)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Can Software Be Portable, Performant and Productive?

Firstly, there is the question of whether or not typical problems actually have low rank structure and how this varies as a system evolves. We will answer this with examples from common test problems. One interesting result is that if the particle transport problem is decomposed into different octants based on the direction of particle travel there are different ranks in each octant. We show how this can be exploited to have more efficient calculations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the adaptive low rank method recently developed can be used to find approximately the correct rank during a calculation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75211' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(225)' class='star'><span class='star225'>&star;</span></a> Peter McCorquodale  <span id='bitlink-3014'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3014)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3014' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3014)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Using the FFTX Library in Applications</b><br />Peter McCorquodale<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-49.html'>High-Performance Computing in the FASTMath SciDAC-5 Institute - Part II of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>FFTX is a performance-portable, open-source FFT software system for CPUs and GPUs analogous to FFTW for CPU systems. It supports application-specific optimizations corresponding to integrating more of the algorithms into the analysis / code-generation process. FFTX is based on the use of Spiral, an open-source analysis and code-generation tool chain for FFTs and tensor algebra algorithms, developed at Carnegie-Mellon University and SpiralGen, Inc.; an FFTX user API implemented in standard C++; and a factored design that allows FFTX / Spiral to be more easily ported across multiple architectures. In FFTX, we can represent larger integrated algorithms that include FFTs composed with algorithmic operations such as multiplication by a (possibly matrix-valued) symbol and batching. By combining substeps in an integrated algorithm, the amount of data traffic can be reduced by significant amounts. FFTX applies the size-specific analysis and automatic code generation techniques in Spiral to generate code, leading to implementations with far higher performance than obtainable from approaches based on black-box FFT implementations. In this talk, we will demonstrate how to install the FFTX library and use it in applications written in C++ and Python, and present results obtained on supercomputers with NVIDIA and AMD GPU systems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75275' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(430)' class='star'><span class='star430'>&star;</span></a> Ian McInerney  <span id='bitlink-3015'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3015)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3015' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3015)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Chopblas: Simulating Mixed-Precision and Stochastically Rounded Linear Algebra</b><br />Ian McInerney<br />Thursday, March 2 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-95.html'>Mixed Precision Algorithms in Numerical Linear Algebra - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we present the ChopBLAS MATLAB library for simulating basic linear algebra operations using mixed precision and non-standard floating-point formats such as BFloat16, stochastic rounding, and custom formats. Existing simulation frameworks use MATLAB classes and operator overloading to implement custom precision data types, which makes implementing mixed-precision computations difficult and leads to decreased computational performance due to the overhead of MATLAB classes. Instead, ChopBLAS uses operation-level rounding, where instead of a custom data type, we store all data as double precision floating-point values, use double precision floating-point arithmetic, and then round the data to the desired precision using either the chop or cpfloat rounding function. By operating on double precision values we are able to exploit the built-in vectorization capabilities of MATLAB operations, leading to a speed-up of nearly 90x and 1050x when simulating stochastic rounding using chop and cpfloat, respectively, compared to a reference BLAS implementation in MATLAB with operation level rounding.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75366' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2068)' class='star'><span class='star2068'>&star;</span></a> Shane A.

The behavior of hot water flow in the pipe network is modeled using the incompressible Euler equations and a suitably chosen energy equation.  By applying different simplifications to these equations, we derive a  catalog of models. Our algorithm is based on this catalog and adaptively controls where in the network which model is used.  Moreover, the granularity of the applied discretization is controlled  in a similar adaptive manner. By doing so, we are able to obtain optimal solutions at low computational costs that satisfy a prescribed tolerance w.r.t.\ the most accurate modeling level.  To adaptively control the switching between different levels and the  adaptation of the discretization grids, we derive error formulas  and a posteriori error estimators.  Under reasonable assumptions we prove that the adaptive algorithm  terminates after finitely many iterations.  Our numerical results show that the algorithm is able to produce  solutions for problem instances that have not been solvable before.

We focus on the context where the optimal regularization parameter is unknown, and the system must be solved for a number of parameters $\lambda$. Our algorithms are applicable in both the underdetermined $m\ll n$ and the overdetermined $m\gg n$ setting. Our algorithms efficiently update preconditioners for new regularization parameters. We introduce an algorithm specifically for an approximately low-rank setting, in which the matrix $A$ has rapidly decreasing singular values and such the problem is of low statistical dimension. The scheme we propose exploits the low statistical dimension while not requiring the computation of the Gram matrix, resulting in a more stable scheme than existing algorithms in this context.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75796' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1734)' class='star'><span class='star1734'>&star;</span></a> Matthias Meinke  <span id='bitlink-3020'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3020)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3020' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3020)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Advanced Simulation Methods for the Prediction of Aerodynamically Generated Noise</b><br />Matthias Meinke<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-382.html'>Cross-Cutting Aspects of Utilizing Exascale Platforms for High-Fidelity CFD - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>The mitigation of aerodynamically generated sound is an important technical field.

This approach is further combined with the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) technique to predict the nonlinear long-time dynamics of the density matrix. The statistical error due to the incorporation of the stochastic resolution of the identity and DMD extrapolation is analyzed in terms of the number of stochastic orbitals, system size, and propagation time.

It is used to describe non-equilibrium flows for completely different conditions. However, there is still no single universal, accurate and computationally inexpensive approach suitable for various degrees of gas rarefaction, characterized by the Knudsen number, Kn. When solving problems, it may be necessary to simulate at relatively low values of Kn corresponding to the slip flow regime, where the often-used DSMC approach becomes computationally too expensive. In such conditions, continuum approaches become relevant. The talk is devoted to actively developing continuum approaches using generalized Chapman-Enskog method. One-temperature, multi-temperature and state-to-state descriptions will be considered. The methods used to speed up calculations will be highlighted, including the possibility of combining different approaches. Particular attention will be paid to validation, which is necessary before using detailed and resource-intensive approaches.

Rev. Lett. 123, 210601 (2019)] to quantum lattice models in 2 + 1 dimensions, by introducing and studying ternary unitary four-particle gates, which are unitary in time and both spatial dimensions. When used as building blocks of lattice models with periodic boundary conditions in time and space (corresponding to infinite temperature states), dynamical correlation functions exhibit a light-ray structure. We also generalize solvable MPS [Phys. Rev. B 101, 094304 (2020)] to two spatial dimensions with cylindrical boundary conditions, by showing that the analogous solvable PEPS can be identified with matrix product unitaries. In the resulting tensor network for evaluating equal-time correlation functions, the bulk ternary unitary gates cancel out. We delineate and implement a numerical algorithm for computing such correlations by contracting the remaining tensors.

The goal is to provide both theoretical justifications and efficient algorithms for imaging extended sources using the sampling methods. In contrast to the existing far/near field operator based on the integral over the space variable in the sampling methods,  a multi-frequency far-field operator  is introduced based on the integral over the frequency variable. This far-field operator is defined in a way to incorporate the possibly non-linear dispersion relation, a unique feature in waveguides. The factorization method is deployed to establish a rigorous characterization of the range support which is the support of source in the direction of wave propagation. A related factorization-based sampling method is also discussed. These sampling methods are shown to be capable of imaging the range support of the source. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the sampling methods, including an example to image a complete sound-soft block.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75450' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(597)' class='star'><span class='star597'>&star;</span></a> Gianmarco Mengaldo  <span id='bitlink-3025'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3025)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3025' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3025)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Spectral/hp Element Methods for Industry: Some Challenges on the Way</b><br />Gianmarco Mengaldo<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-131.html'>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>We present the evolution of spectral/hp element methods over the past several years, and their recent successful deployment to industrial problems.

Motivated in particular by problems in nuclear model calibration, we suppose that each summand function is computationally expensive, and that moreover, the summand functions can be evaluated independently. In this setting, we propose and demonstrate a novel method inspired by variance reduction methods in machine learning; such a method permits us to more judiciously select a subset of summand functions to evaluate on each iteration according to a particular probability distribution. We then combine this methodology with sketching methods, enabling judicious sketches of the problem Jacobian. Numerical results demonstrating the efficiency of our Jacobian sketching method will be presented.

Numerical modeling and theory are essential tools for analyzing the mechanism of such coordinated, collective cell behavior. To do so, single-cell models must be sufficiently detailed so they correctly capture essential aspects of individual cells and do not oversimplify. At the same time, single-cell models must be sufficiently simple and computationally efficient so they can be upscaled to multicellular systems. Here I will present a series of our recent hybrid cellular Potts models for modeling individual cell behavior, and show how these can be used to study the coordinated cell behavior that is seen in biological development. I will discuss single cell models used to analyze observations such as anomalous cell migration patterns of immune cells, mechanical cell and extracellular matrix interactions, and models of anisotropic force generation. I will end by presenting stategies for using these hybrid CPMs to study collective cell behavior.

These approaches consider a candidate library of terms and use sparse regression to prune the model to find the model which best describes the data. Our Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) method transforms a vast number of computationally challenging system identification problems into a simple weighted least squares solve. These systems can be identified in seconds (on a laptop) and for many equations in the presence of greater than 100% noise levels. In this talk, I will present an overview of WSINDy, highlighting the features that give WSINDy its computational efficiencies.  I will also present an illustration of applying WSINDy to several challenging examples, including recovering the equations of an ideal magneto-hydrodynamic fluid in a simple test problem.

Although there are many methods currently available for performing differential sensitivity analysis, it can be difficult to determine which method is best suited for a particular model. We explain a variety of differential sensitivity methods and assess their value in some typical biological models. First, we explain the mathematical basis for three numerical methods: adjoint sensitivity analysis, complex perturbation sensitivity analysis, and forward mode sensitivity analysis. We then carry out four instructive case studies. (a) The CARRGO model for tumor-immune interaction highlights the additional information that differential sensitivity analysis provides beyond traditional naive sensitivity methods, (b) the deterministic SIR model demonstrates the value of using second-order sensitivity in refining model predictions, (c) the stochastic SIR model shows how differential sensitivity can be attacked in stochastic modeling, and (d) a discrete birth-death-migration model illustrates how the complex perturbation method of differential sensitivity can be generalized to a broader range of biological models. Finally, we compare speed, accuracy, and ease of use. We find that forward mode automatic differentiation has the quickest computational time, while the complex perturbation method is the simplest to implement and the most generalizable.	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75555' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1095)' class='star'><span class='star1095'>&star;</span></a> Vassilios Mewes  <span id='bitlink-3030'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3030)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3030' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3030)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Neutrino Radiation Hydrodynamics with Thornado and Weaklib</b><br />Vassilios Mewes<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-241.html'>Computational Methods in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics - Part II of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Neutrino-matter coupling via weak interactions is one of the most important physical  mechanism in the evolution of core-collapse supernovae (CCSN).

We consider the  optimization problem of adding k new edges to G such that the resulting  graph has minimal total effective resistance (i. e., is most robust).  The total effective resistance and effective resistances between nodes  can be computed using the pseudoinverse of the graph Laplacian. The  pseudoinverse may be computed explicitly, but this takes cubic time in  practice and quadratic space. We instead exploit combinatorial and  algebraic connections to speed up gain computations in established  generic greedy heuristics. Moreover, we leverage existing randomized  techniques to boost the performance of our approaches by introducing a  sub-sampling step. Our different graph- and matrix-based approaches are  indeed significantly faster than the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm,  while their quality remains reasonably high and is often quite close.  Our experiments show that we can now process large graphs for which the  application of the state-of-the-art greedy approach was infeasible  before. As far as we know, we are the first to be able to process graphs  with 100K+ nodes in the order of minutes.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75715' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1597)' class='star'><span class='star1597'>&star;</span></a> Alessandra Micheletti  <span id='bitlink-3032'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3032)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3032' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3032)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators: a Mathematical Tool for Explainable Artificial Intelligence</b><br />Alessandra Micheletti<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-353.html'>ECMI: Perspectives and Successes of Mathematical Challenges in Industrial Applications  - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Recently the topic of explainability of Artificial Intelligence has been gaining increasing interest from a large part of the scientific community. First, this is due to the desire to investigate the mechanisms of Artificial Intelligence more thoroughly, to better understand its core functioning, so that anomalies, unexpected behaviors and even counterfeits can be prevented. Second, the interest is in part encouraged by the demands of policymakers, who demand techniques that can be understood by humans and relied upon for public decision-making, not only for excellent results but also for inherent transparency.   In this context Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have been developed to establish a mathematical theory of information processing agents. GENEOs are understood as the mathematical formulation of agents who act on the data, and give an opinion. Equivariance is indeed the key property of GENEOs, since it guarantees to filter out the data information that is not relevant for the problem in focus.  In this talk we will introduce GENEOs and describe how they have been successfully employed to face some industrial problems, in the field of medicinal chemistry, implants inspection and maintenance and materials science.

Since summation is part of dot product and matrix multiplication operations, routines that have increasingly started appearing in the hardware of supercomputers, exploring monotonicity or nonmonotonicity is of wide interest. We provide details on what features multi-term addition algorithms need in order to avoid non-monotonic behaviour. We also look at algorithms that utilize multi-term summation and vector-vector, matrix-vector, or matrix-matrix operations that can have non-monotonic behaviour. We suggest that nonmonotonicity of multi-term summation, in some available hardware devices from large-scale chip companies, is a feature that may have appeared unintentionally as a consequence of design choices, and neither the fact of appearance in these devices nor that nonmonotonicity can happen in multi-term floating-point adders in general has been analysed in literature before, to the best of our knowledge.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75366' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1453)' class='star'><span class='star1453'>&star;</span></a> Istvan Miklos  <span id='bitlink-3035'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3035)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3035' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3035)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Degree Sequence Problems in NMR Spectroscopy</b><br />Istvan Miklos<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-320.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>The 1H-NMR spectroscopy can measure how many hydrogen atoms a carbon atom  can bind, furthermore, how many hydrogen atoms the neighbor carbon atoms  altogether can bind. Each carbon atom can make four covalent bonds.  Therefore, the number of neighbor carbon atoms to a particular carbon atom  is four minus the number of its hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, the number of  second neighbor carbon atoms is three times the number of neighbor carbon  atoms minus the number of those hydrogen atoms that the neighbor carbon  atoms bond. That is, from the 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we can obtain the degree  and neighbor degree sequences of hydrocarbons. When these hydrocarbons are  saturated and acyclic (these properties are easy to check by simple, fast  and cheap lab tests), the chemical structure prediction is equivalent to  constructing bounded degree trees with prescribed degree and neighbor  degree sequences.

In the past, this meant a great deal of focus on inter-node scalability, but, as we enter the exascale era, the primary challenge to enabling extreme-scale computation has become harnessing abundant fine-scale parallelism within compute nodes -- primarily in the form of GPU-based accelerators. We will discuss how the PETSc design for performance portability addresses these challenges while stressing flexibility and extensibility by separating the programming model used by the application from that used by the library, and we will present some examples of how this facilitates end-to-end utilization of GPUs for PETSc-based simulations on cutting-edge high-performance computing architectures. Additionally, we will discuss recent developments in PETSc's communication module, PetscSF, that enable flexibility and scalable performance across large GPU-based systems while overcoming some of the difficulties posed by working directly with the Message Passing Interface (MPI) on these systems.

Recent developments and optimizations have led to an unprecedented milestone in the ability to perform large-eddy simulation of a full reactor core. Careful tuning of the high-performance kernels, the multilevel solvers, and timestepping algorithms led to a 4X speed-up in performance when running on all GPUs of Summit (4608 nodes=27648 GPUs) at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. As a result, it is now possible to simulate flow through a 352000-pebble bed reactor (98 million spectral elements of order N=8, n=51 billion gridpoints) in just six hours of wall clock time.    
We also explore large-eddy-simulation modeling approaches and computational  performance for the simulation of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flows that are of direct relevance to wind energy production.

Traditional algorithms used to compute Tucker decompositions can be computationally expensive as they involve computing the SVD of mode unfolding, which can be quite large. Existing randomized and parallel algorithms have reduced this cost, but computational challenges remain. We propose new randomized parallel algorithms to address these challenges. Using randomized matrix techniques, we accelerate a distributed-memory implementation of the Tucker decomposition to obtain an efficient algorithm that avoids communication. Specifically, we employ a new sketching method that exploits Kronecker structure to accelerate a key computation. We also present probabilistic analysis of the error resulting from the algorithm, as well as numerical results demonstrating the computational benefits of this approach.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75212' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(36)' class='star'><span class='star36'>&star;</span></a> Marco Minutoli  <span id='bitlink-3039'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3039)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3039' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3039)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Graman: Graph Network Based Simulator for Forecasting Molecular Polarizabilities</b><br />Marco Minutoli<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-8.html'>Scaling Data Science, AI, and, ML on Massively Multi-Threaded Systems - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Realistic, high-quality simulations of complex physical systems often require substantial computational resources making them challenging to scale up to larger systems. A promising approach to overcome these limitations is to use machine learning models trained on experimental and simulation data. One of the many applications that can benefit from such an approach is simulating Raman spectra from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Recent works have shown that Graph Network-based simulators can be trained to simulate complex dynamical systems. In this talk, we will present our Graph Network-based simulator to accelerate the simulation of Raman spectra. The proposed simulator constitutes of three components: (1) encoder which constructs the graph given the atomic positions and embeds the atoms/edges into a latent space; (2) Graph-Network processor which learns the spatial interactions among atoms and updates the latent embeddings; and (3) decoder which learns the dynamics and predicts the next state of the simulation. Currently, our simulator is trained to simulate molecule trajectories. We trained our simulator on synthetic simulation data obtained from NWChem. We observed satisfactory performance on single-step prediction. We plan to develop novel methodologies to improve multi-step prediction performance. Finally, we dive into future research opportunities on generalizing this approach to other physical systems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75194' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1192)' class='star'><span class='star1192'>&star;</span></a> Davoud Mirzaei  <span id='bitlink-3040'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3040)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3040' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3040)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Non-Oscillatory Finite Volume Method Based on a Pointwise Smoothing RBF Approximation for Conservation Laws</b><br />Davoud Mirzaei<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-262.html'>Advances in Radial Basis Functions for Numerical Simulation - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>One of the properties of a conservation law problem is that even if the initial condition is smooth the solution may evolve into a discontinuity or a sharp front. These discontinuities and sharp gradients result in non-physical oscillations in the numerical solution. The purpose of numerical methods is to precisely capture and suppress these oscillations while achieving a solution with a high order of convergence. There are several approaches but one of the most significant and commonly used is a class of essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) or weighted ENO (WENO) methods. The primary idea behind the ENO (or WENO) reconstruction is to determine a set of stencils surrounding a control volume, execute a reconstruction on each of these stencils, and finally pick up the smoothest (or a weighted) approximation as the desired reconstruction for that control volume. In this talk, we present an alternative approach which employs a single central stencil per any cell and suppresses oscillations by utilizing a new RBF approximate-interpolation method based on a pointwise smoothing approximation.          </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75599' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1129)' class='star'><span class='star1129'>&star;</span></a> Wayne Mitchell  <span id='bitlink-3041'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3041)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3041' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3041)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Performance of Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) on GPU Machines</b><br />Wayne Mitchell<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-248.html'>Parallel-in-Time Algorithms: Performance and Real-World Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) is an optimal, scalable, multilevel parallel in time algorithm that has been shown to achieve significant speedup vs. sequential time stepping on massively parallel CPU machines.

The single domain multivariate spectral collocation methods have been proven to be effective in solving time-dependent PDEs defined over small time domains. However, there is a significant loss of accuracy as time domain proliferates and also when the number of grid nodes approaches a definite particular number. Therefore, the establishment of the new innovative multi-domain multivariate spectral quasilinearisation method (MDMV-SQLM) is described for the purpose of solving (2+1) dimensional nonlinear PDEs defined on large time intervals. The main output of this study is confirmation that minimizing the size of time computational domain at each subinterval assures sufficiently accurate results that are attained using minimal number of nodal points and computational time.  To highlight the efficiency and accuracy of the MDMV-SQLM, error estimates, condition numbers and CPU time are presented for nonlinear Burger’s PDEs. The adoption of the domain decomposition technique is efficacious in suppressing the numerical challenges linked to large matrices and ill-conditioned nature of the resulting coefficient matrix. Also, the obtained results confirm that the numerical scheme is computationally cheap, fast and yield extremely accurate and stable results using fewer number of grid points for large time domains.

The reduced system can be written as a fixed-point problem that can be solved with stationary iterative schemes. Numerical results with 2D benchmarks will be presented to study the performance of the approach. Compared to the standard HDG approach, the properties of the reduced system are improved with CHDG, which is more suited for iterative solution procedures with e.g. GMRES or CGN.

Deep learning is a popular approach, but they typically lack the strong physical constraints intrinsic in PDEs. Differentiable programming is an emerging paradigm that aims to enable the expressivity of neural networks inside PDEs, such that the learned model is intimately connected to the physics of the problem by construction. Recent efforts in differentiable programming have shown promise in learning accurate parameterizations from simulation data with known numerical properties. However, several earth/climate applications have incomplete or partially known PDEs that need non-intrusive parameterization from observational training data. This leads to a significantly challenging learning problem, where the strengths and weaknesses of differentiable programming are less known.  Furthermore, PDEs often exhibit chaotic non-local dynamics, which are harder to model than the local dynamics seen in several canonical PDEs. In this work, we systematically study differentiable programming-based strategies to learn such non-local dynamics by training neural networks embedded directly inside a non-local generalized Burgers system. In particular, we represent the nonlinear and non-local terms as neural networks and use backpropagation to train the equations while simultaneously solving the surrogate PDE in the forward pass. Additionally, we investigate the properties of the learned surrogate PDEs, including their sensitivity to system noise, external forcing, impact on prediction accuracy, and comment on potential applications. Our results show that differentiable programming as a paradigm can accurately model PDEs while surpassing vanilla neural networks. Interestingly, it succeeds even when strong assumptions are made about the missing physics while requiring lesser data and computational cost. However, we also discover that the problem specification and numerical methods employed have a non-trivial impact on the quality and stability of the learned surrogate model, with significant implications for various applications.

When surrounded by classical materials (with a positive permittivity), particular behaviors arise and the interface between the materials, especially in presence of corners. This motivates the study of transmission problems with sign-changing coefficients and polygonal interface. Even when the problem is well-posed (which can be established via the T-coercivity theory), the numerical computation based on standard finite element method (FEM) still can fail. FEM convergence can be guaranteed as long as T-coercivity arguments are satisfied at the discrete level, which can boil down to use locally T-conforming meshes. T-conforming meshes rely on specific symmetry requirements on the mesh, and in practice, it is relatively cumbersome to construct for polygonal interfaces. We develop and provide a T-conforming mesh generator for (almost) arbitrary polygonal interfaces in two dimensions, and provide a battery of tests to illustrate the need and efficiency of the designed meshes.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75658' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1831)' class='star'><span class='star1831'>&star;</span></a> Rambod Mojgani  <span id='bitlink-3050'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3050)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3050' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3050)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Discovery of Interpretable Structural Model Errors by Combining Bayesian Sparse Regression and Data Assimilation</b><br />Rambod Mojgani<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-403.html'>Data-Driven Dynamics and Model Reduction for Nonlinear Systems in Engineering</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>We introduce MEDIA (Model Error Discovery with Interpretability and Data-Assimilation),  a framework designed to identify structural errors in models of nonlinear dynamical systems. While traditional calibration methods can reduce parametric uncertainties, it remains a challenge to deduce structural uncertainties from observations.    
We demonstrate the performance of our framework on a canonical prototype of geophysical turbulence, the two–level quasi–geostrophic system. A Bayesian sparsity–promoting regression  framework is used to select the relevant terms from a library of interpretable kernels. As calculating the library from noisy and sparse data (e.g., from observations) using conventional techniques leads to interpolation and numerical errors, here we propose using a coordinate-based multi–layer embedding to impute the sparse observations. We demonstrate the importance of alleviating spectral bias, especially with the multi–scale nature of turbulent flows, and show a random Fourier feature layer can sufficiently increase accuracy of the kernel terms to enable an accurate discovery. Our framework successfully identifies structural model errors due to linear and nonlinear processes (e.g., radiation, surface friction, advection), as well as misrepresented  orography.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75883' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1054)' class='star'><span class='star1054'>&star;</span></a> Andrea Mola  <span id='bitlink-3051'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3051)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3051' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3051)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Pod Based Reduced Order Model for Computational Cost Reduction of Industrial Packaging Systems Heat Exchange Simulations</b><br />Andrea Mola<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-231.html'>Accelerating Computational Science and Engineering via Data-Driven Learning and Nonlinear Model Reduction - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>This contribution presents an application of model order reduction to the simulation of the temperature field evolution during the sealing of cardboard beverage packages in an industrial machinery. In such process, the folding flaps of the polylaminated package are heated through a hot air jet, and then pressed together to obtain a watertight welding. A satisfactory sealing is obtained when the local polylaminated material temperatures are in the correct window at the moment when folding flaps are pressed one against each other.  Simulations of the temperature field evolution within the layers of the package based on the solution of the Fourier equation, have been carried out to analyze how much the process is dependent on parameters such as the package dimension and layers materials properties, the heating air temperature and speed, and the heating time.  In the framework of the full order model, the heat exchange govern equation is discretized making use of the Finite Element Method, implemented in a C++ software. A reduced order model has also been developed to allow for faster computations, compatible with real time control algorithms wired in the packaging machinery. Based on POD modal decomposition, both a non intrusive model based on the interpolation of the proper orthogonal decomposition modes, and a POD-Galerkin intrusive solver have been developed.

We carry out a    rounding error analysis of this algorithm that provides us with an    explicit rule to decide which element goes into which bucket and allows    us to rigorously control the accuracy of the algorithm. We implement the    algorithm on a multicore computer and obtain significant speedups (up to    a factor $7\times$) with respect to uniform precision algorithms, without loss of accuracy, on a range of sparse matrices    from real-life applications. We showcase the effectiveness of our    algorithm by plugging it into a GMRES solver for sparse linear systems    and observe that the convergence of the solution is essentially    unaffected by the use of adaptive precision.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75367' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(664)' class='star'><span class='star664'>&star;</span></a> Roberto Molinaro  <span id='bitlink-3053'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3053)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3053' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3053)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Fourier Neural Operator for Solving a Class of Inverse Problems</b><br />Roberto Molinaro<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:50 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-146.html'>Scientific Machine Learning and Data-Driven Techniques in Complex Multi-Physics Systems  - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>In the present work, we develop a model, named Deep Fourier Neural Operator, to learn the map from operators to functions.

XGC is a US ECP (Exascale Computing Project) and SciDAC code. XGC evaluates dissipative operations such as Fokker-Planck Coulomb collisions and heat sources/sinks on a 5D (3D configuration and 2D velocity space) grid at each time step. This requires a mapping back-and-forth between the marker particles and the 5D phase-space grid. To enable exact conservation properties (of particle number, momentum and energy) and to avoid significant error accumulation over time in plasmas with steep density and temperature gradients, as appears in a tokamak edge, the code has recently been equipped with a novel mapping in 2D velocity space based on the calculation of a pseudo-inverse. This mapping has been implemented in XGC using the PETSc library and generalized to use a discretization space of any order.    
A complication of the pseudo-inverse mapping is that the calculation is only well-posed if the particle coverage is good enough in the simulations. Here we explore the performance and the robustness of the mapping in various scenarios using different numerical solvers in PETSc and possible solutions to obtain sufficient particle coverage. We also discuss the possibility of using the mapping as a coarse-graining technique to control particle noise.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75405' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1200)' class='star'><span class='star1200'>&star;</span></a> Matthias Moller  <span id='bitlink-3055'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3055)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3055' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3055)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>IgaNets: Physics-Informed Machine Learning Embedded Into Isogeometric Analysis</b><br />Matthias Moller<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-264.html'>Bridging Numerical Analysis and Machine Learning - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>In this talk we present a novel approach to embed physics-informed neural networks (PINN) into the framework of Isogeometric Analysis. IGA is an extension of the finite element method that integrates simulation-based analysis into the computer-aided design pipeline. In short, the same mathematical formalism, namely B-splines or NURBS, that is used to model the geometry is adopted to represent the approximate solution, which is computed following the same strategy as in classical finite elements.  In contrast to classical PINNs, which predict point-wise solution values to (initial-)boundary-value problems directly, our IgaNets learn solutions in terms of their expansion coefficients relative to a given B-Spline or NURBS basis. This approach is also used to encode the geometry and other problem parameters such as boundary conditions and feed them into the network as inputs. Once trained, our IgaNets make it possible to explorer various designs from a family of similar problem configurations efficiently without the need to perform a computationally expensive simulation for each new problem configuration.    
Next to discussing the method conceptually and presenting numerical results, we will shed some light on the technical details of our C++ reference implementation in Torch. In particular, we will discuss matrix-based implementation of B-splines that is particularly suited for efficient backpropagation.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75604' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1507)' class='star'><span class='star1507'>&star;</span></a> Ali Momin  <span id='bitlink-3056'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3056)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3056' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3056)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stencil Computations in Petroleum Industry</b><br />Ali Momin<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-332.html'>Stencil Computation for Scientific Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>To Be Defined..  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75737' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(445)' class='star'><span class='star445'>&star;</span></a> Thibault Monsel  <span id='bitlink-3057'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3057)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3057' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3057)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>End-to-End Learning of Dynamical Systems with the Mori-Zwanzig Formalism</b><br />Thibault Monsel<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-98.html'>Optimization-Based and Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling of Structured Dynamical Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>Deep learning approaches are extensively applied in order to capture the underlying dynamics of a physical phenomenon but often lack interpretability, performance, robustness guarantees and insights into the structure of the dynamics. In this work, we formulate the problem within the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism, a technique that arose in the field of statistical mechanics that allows to derive exact evolution equation for coarse-grained quantities of interest from high-dimensional systems. Not only this approach offers, by design, an explainable structure by separating the dynamics into a Markovian and a memory term but it allows a principled use of the available observational data by providing a physically consistent functional structure to learn. A neural network approximation format and efficient numerical integrator are coupled together, leading to a flexible and powerful representation model compliant with the MZ framework. The method is demonstrated on linear systems for which an analytical derivation of the MZ formalism is available allowing rigorous comparison; as well as on nonlinear, possibly chaotic, systems such as Van der Pol oscillator and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model, exhibiting a superior approximation performance in terms of data requirement and generalizability.

In this setting, based on these results, QAOA may be able to outperform leading classical algorithms. Second, I will discuss whether QAOA could be applied to solve hard protein folding problems. In this case, the situation seems more challenging and QAOA may not significantly outperform existing methods.

Employing such a methodology within the context of a skew-symmetric discontinuous Galerkin formulation, we develop discretizations on curvilinear meshes which are energy conservative for the linear advection equation in the case of a central numerical flux and energy dissipative for an upwind numerical flux. We then describe the implementation of efficient algorithms for evaluating the proposed tensor-product operators within an open-source Julia code. Finally, the stability and conservation properties of the proposed methods are verified numerically, and comparisons with existing methods on the basis of accuracy and computational cost are presented, demonstrating that for higher polynomial degrees, the proposed schemes are more efficient than comparable multidimensional (i.e. non-tensor-product) formulations on triangles and tetrahedra.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75458' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(941)' class='star'><span class='star941'>&star;</span></a> Nick Moore  <span id='bitlink-3062'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3062)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3062' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3062)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Propulsion by Flexible Appendages and Hydrodynamic Schooling</b><br />Nick Moore<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-206.html'>Numerical Simulation of Bio-Inspired Fluid-Structure Interaction - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>I will discuss propulsion by flexible appendages, as in swimming or flying.

We obtain a new algorithm that can outperform the classical one, even on small blocks, by trading multiplications with additions. To this end, we introduce commutative algorithms that generalize Winograd’s folding technique and combine it with fast matrix multiplication algorithms and the fast base change technique. Thus, when a single scalar multiplication requires $\rho$ times more clock cycles than an addition our technique reduces the computation cost of multiplying the small sub-blocks by a factor of $\frac{\rho+3}{2\left(\rho+1\right)}$ compared to using the classical algorithm. Our technique also reduces the energy cost of the algorithm, as the $\rho$ values for energy costs are typically even larger than the values for arithmetic costs.    
Specifically, we obtain an algorithm for multiplying 2x2 blocks using only four multiplications. This algorithm seemingly contradicts the lower bound of Winograd (1971) on multiplying 2x2 matrices. However, we obtain this algorithm by bypassing the implicit assumptions of the lower bound. We provide a new lower bound matching our algorithm for 2x2 block multiplication, thus showing our technique is optimal.

Other KPI (Key Performance Indicators) such as scalability, reliability or congestion management are also central to cope with issues raised in an Exascale environment. Future environments are likely to feature multiple NICs thus increasing substantially bandwidth capabilities that are yet to be taken advantage of for BXI networks.    
To abstract these network complexities to the developer, MPI  (Message Passing Interface) has become the de facto standard in the scientific community.

In particular, we will explain the software architecture and design choices that were made to efficiently support the protocols needed to communicate on multiple network cards while taking advantage of the hardware capabilities of the BXI NICs.

In the mold, the steel begins its solidification, and several complex physical phenomena happen.  To ensure a proper control of the process, it is necessary to know how the steel is behaving inside the mold. However, it is not possible to make measurements inside the solidifying steel and the only available data are pointwise temperature measurements in the interior of the mold plates. To provide a tool for the proper control of the process, we developed a methodology for the real-time estimation of the heat flux at the steel-mold interface given the temperature measurements. With this tool, we allow the caster operator to quickly detect any malfunctioning in the casting increasing the safety and the productivity of continuous casters.

By approaching the representation and assembly of multiphysics problems as a synthetic differential geometry problem and using de Rahm complexes to model partial differential equations, we developed Decapodes.jl, a software library for representing, composing, and solving partial differential equations.    
The diagrammatic representations provide an intuitive interface for specifying the relationships between variables in a system of equations, a method for composing systems equations into a multiphysics model using an operad of wiring diagrams, and an algorithm for deriving solvers using directed hypergraphs. This approach yields a method of generating executable systems from these diagrams using the operators of discrete exterior calculus on a simplicial set. The generated solvers produce numerical solutions consistent with state of the art open source tools as demonstrated by benchmark comparisons with SU2. This software demonstrates the feasibility of synthetic approach to differential geometry as a foundation for numerical multiphysics simulation and identifies areas requiring further development, potentially via implementation of the finite-element exterior calculus.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75448' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(17)' class='star'><span class='star17'>&star;</span></a> Hugh Morrison  <span id='bitlink-3068'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3068)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3068' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3068)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>BOSS: A Probabilistic Parameterization Framework to Improve the Representation of Microphysical Process Rates in Weather and Climate Models</b><br />Hugh Morrison<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-4.html'>Understanding Cloud Physics Using Stochastic, Dynamical, and Data-Driven Modeling - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Weather and climate models represent cloud microphysics using computationally-efficient bulk schemes that predict only a few variables such as drop number and mass concentrations. Current bulk schemes exhibit deficiencies that are due in part to their simplified representation of a complex natural state, and in part due to a fundamental lack of understanding of microphysical processes. These schemes also employ numerous ad-hoc assumptions, parameter choices, and model structural assumptions. To synthesize information from detailed process models and observations for improving bulk schemes, we have developed a novel probabilistic parameterization framework called the Bayesian Observationally-constrained Statistical-physical Scheme (BOSS). BOSS combines existing, though limited, process level microphysical knowledge with flexible process rate formulations and parameters trained to observations and data from detailed process models through Bayesian inference. The approach is flexible and can be used to examine structural choices in bulk schemes, particularly the functional form of process rates and the number of predicted cloud microphysical variables. This allows for systematic quantification of both parametric and structural uncertainty, which is not possible using traditional schemes. Results using an MCMC sampler with BOSS to constrain process rates and parameters with synthetic &#8220;observations' generated by a detailed bin microphysical model will be presented.

However, the stringent accuracy requirements required to compute meaningful material properties, in conjunction with the asymptotic cubic-scaling computational complexity of the underlying eigenvalue problem, demand enormous computational resources. Thus, these calculations are routinely limited to material systems with at most a few thousand electrons. In this talk, recent advances in enabling fast and accurate large-scale real-space Kohn-Sham DFT calculations -via- the development of DFT-FE, a massively parallel open-source finite-element(FE) based DFT code on hybrid CPU-GPU architectures will be discussed. DFT-FE employs adaptive FE discretisation that handles pseudopotential and all-electron calculations while accommodating periodic, non-periodic and semi-periodic boundary conditions. The talk will highlight novel HPC-centric numerical strategies that significantly reduce the data movement costs and increase arithmetic intensity on evolving hybrid architectures, considerably delaying the onset of cubic scaling computational complexity to system sizes comprising 30,000 electrons. These advances have wide-ranging implications for tackling various scientific problems involving large-scale material systems in the areas of energy storage, catalysis, alloy design etc.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75878' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(485)' class='star'><span class='star485'>&star;</span></a> Mohammad Motamed  <span id='bitlink-3074'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3074)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3074' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3074)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Residual Multi-Fidelity Neural Networks</b><br />Mohammad Motamed<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-107.html'>Information Fusion for Computational Models and Inverse Problems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>We present a residual multi-fidelity computational framework that effectively utilizes the approximation power of deep neural networks. Given a low-fidelity and a high-fidelity computational model, we formulate the correlation between the two models in terms of a residual function. Precisely, instead of searching for a direct correlation between the two models, we consider a possibly nonlinear relation between the low-fidelity model and the residual of the two models. The smaller magnitude of the residual function, compared to the size of the high-fidelity quantity, enables the construction of a residual network that learns the residual function using a small set of high-fidelity data. The trained residual network is then used to efficiently generate additional high-fidelity data. Finally, the set of all available and newly generated high-fidelity data are used to train a deep network that learns the high-fidelity quantity of interest. We present several numerical examples to demonstrate the power of the proposed framework. We show that dramatic savings in computational cost may be achieved when the output predictions are desired to be accurate within small tolerances.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75381' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(538)' class='star'><span class='star538'>&star;</span></a> Mostafa Mousavi  <span id='bitlink-3075'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3075)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3075' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3075)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep-Learning Seismology: Too Far, Too Close</b><br />Mostafa Mousavi<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-117.html'>Data Science Solutions for Earth Sciences – a Path to a Sustainable Future - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75393' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(776)' class='star'><span class='star776'>&star;</span></a> Mostafa Mousavi  <span id='bitlink-3076'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3076)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3076' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3076)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Learning of Seismograms</b><br />Mostafa Mousavi<br />Friday, March 3 12:34 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-169.html'>Advances in High Performance Computing for Earth Science - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>Seismology is a data-rich and data-driven science in which the application of machine learning (ML) techniques has been growing rapidly. Among the various ML techniques, seismologists quickly recognized and realized the potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) to address a broad array of seismological applications. Much of this is due to the availability of large-scale datasets and the suitability of deep-learning techniques for seismic data processing; however, some aspects of applying AI to seismology are likely to prove instructive for geosciences more broadly. Deep learning is a powerful approach, but its application has subtleties and nuances. I will present a systematic overview of trends, challenges, and opportunities in applications of deep-learning methods in seismology.

With these computational speed-ups, real-time solutions to problems where conventional methods often struggle, such as data assimilation, is now possible.    
In this talk, we will present how a neural network-based forward solver is embedded into a Bayesian data assimilation framework. Specifically, we will show how a particle filter approach can be sped-up by several orders magnitude without sacrificing accuracy by using neural network surrogates.    
The general idea is to reduce the dimension of the high-fidelity state using an autoencoder and then perform time-stepping in the low-dimensional latent space using a transformer neural network. The data assimilation then takes place in the latent space instead of the high-fidelity space. To do so efficiently, it is helpful to incorporate certain properties into the latent space, such as distributional and smoothness to enable sampling.    
The result of the data assimilation is a latent space posterior distribution that characterizes the assimilated latent state. This information is then transformed back to the high-fidelity state to get the final estimates and uncertainties.    
The methodology is showcased on a leak detection problem in pipelines. This problem is modeled by a set of nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs with a discontinuous source term, which makes it difficult to solve for conventional methods in a satisfying timeframe.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75595' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2035)' class='star'><span class='star2035'>&star;</span></a> Edison Mucllari  <span id='bitlink-3079'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3079)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3079' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3079)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Neumann-Cayley Orthogonal Gated Recurrent Units with Some Applications in Bio-molecular Data</b><br />Edison Mucllari<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-423.html'>Student Days: Student Chapter Presentations - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>TBA  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77175' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(329)' class='star'><span class='star329'>&star;</span></a> Martin Mueller  <span id='bitlink-3080'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3080)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3080' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3080)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Machine Learning Assisted Simulation Using Highly Coupled GPU, CPU and Deep Learning Accelerators</b><br />Martin Mueller<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-72.html'>Co-Design for Heterogeneous System Architectures - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>High performance computing workloads have started to leverage the benefits of AI both in software and hardware, namely merging traditional, first principles workloads with deep learning models. In multiphysics problems, intersection of machine learning with first principles simulation, sometimes referred to as cognitive simulation, has given rise to new paradigms in computational modeling and simulation where benefits are yet to be recognized.   In this talk, we will focus on a specific subclass of ML assisted simulation, where tens, hundreds or potentially thousands of surrogate models representing different physiochemical phenomena, material properties, and regimes, are used to replace sections of the computational code historically solved through first principles methods. The simulation will run on innovative node-level heterogeneous design, consisting of Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU), GPU, and CPU. We will show for cases where strong coupling between the surrogate models and the main computational loop is required (i.e., calling the surrogates within a computational loop for each step of the simulation), and for problems that are latency-bound with low number of inference calls to each model (i.e., small batch sizes) SambaNova’s Reconfigurable Dataflow Architecture (RDA) serves particularly well. An example use case will be presented and the improvements will be discussed.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75319' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(238)' class='star'><span class='star238'>&star;</span></a> Markus Muhr  <span id='bitlink-3081'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3081)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3081' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3081)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Lbm Bloodflow and Endovascular Coiling-Simulations in 3D Aneurysm-Geometries</b><br />Markus Muhr<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-52.html'>Computational Modeling of Coupled Multiscale Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Cerebral aneurysms pose a big and creeping danger to patients due to their ubiquitous risk of rupture. In order to quantify the rupture-risk as well as to assess different treatment strategies in-silico, detailed numerical simulations of the hemodynamics within the aneurysm as well as the interaction with treatment devices such as coils are necessary. In this talk, we present research and simulation results based on the Lattice-Boltzmann method to simulate the bloodflow within real, 3D and patient specific vessel-geometries obtained from medical scans. Realistic coil geometries are obtained via a one-dimensional spring-wire insertion simulation that takes into account bending, wall-contact, self-intersection as well as a manufacturer-predefined coil micro-structure that allows to fill the aneurysms space to a large extend, eventually occluding it from further bloodflow.   In order to lower computational costs, we also aim to replace and compare such, computationally costly, fully resolved coiling-bloodflow-simulations by means of porous medium surrogate models, where parameters such as porosity and permeability are obtained via homogenization from different, realistic coils as mentioned before.  It is our goal to eventually provide a simulation tool that will allow medical doctors to judge and select – based on quantities of interest such as the wall-shear-stress on the aneurysm walls – different treatment methods and devices in advance, based on the specific patients data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75278' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1432)' class='star'><span class='star1432'>&star;</span></a> Shyamali Mukherjee  <span id='bitlink-3082'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3082)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3082' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3082)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tools to Rapidly Develop Sophisticated HPC Software Libraries</b><br />Shyamali Mukherjee<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-315.html'>Towards Improvement of Sustainability and Productivity for Research Software - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Applications run on supercomputers having heterogeneous nodes require sophisticated HPC software libraries, e.g., Kokkos, VT, and these HPC software libraries provide intelligent capabilities involving, e.g., load balancing, resilience, support for performance profiling and support for debugging.

Muller<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-354.html'>New Developments in Shape, Topology and Tubular Optimization - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>In this contribution we present a first order approach to shape optimization problems for Lipschitz domains featuring mesh quality preserving deformations.  The approach utilizes an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to determine the deformation field from the directional shape derivative of the objective function.  The considered shape deformation field corresponds to the steepest descent direction in $W^{1,\infty}$-topology.  We use the surface formulation of the shape derivative of the objective function to obtain the descent direction and a standard second-order finite volume method for the discretization.  Applications refer to parameter-free shape optimizations to minimize the drag of a wetted obstacle in fluid dynamics Navier-Stokes flow problems. To avoid trivial or undesired solutions, the deformation field inherently fulfills a set of geometric constraints, i.e. conserving displacement and barycenter/center of buoyancy of the obstacle.  The method is first applied to a $3D$ configuration in laminar, single-phase flow at low Reynolds number ($Re = 10$), where the characteristic (optimal) shape of the solution is known. Subsequently, we minimize the drag of a free floating vessel exposed to turbulent (Reynolds-averaged) two-phase flows in realistic operating conditions at $Re= 1.43 \cdot 10^7$ and $Fn=0.26$.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75781' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(850)' class='star'><span class='star850'>&star;</span></a> Peter Munch  <span id='bitlink-3087'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3087)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3087' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3087)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Application and Tailoring of Matrix-Free Algorithms to Many-Particle Solid-State-Sintering Phase-Field Implementations</b><br />Peter Munch<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-186.html'>Matrix-Free Solvers for Large-Scale Applications</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Biodegradable magnesium implants bear a great potential since they degrade after a certain period, during which they temporarily support the healing process. Solid-state-sintering processes are able to produce patient-specific implants. In order to understand and improve the manufacturing process, we perform experiments and develop numerical tools, e.g., based on phase-field (PF) methods, at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon.  To be able to simulate problems at late simulation stages when a spherical approximation of particles is not applicable with many particles (1000), we have reimplemented parts of our PF code, leveraging state-of-the-art matrix-free finite-element building blocks.    
In this presentation, we summarize our efforts in porting a sintering application to matrix-free FEM and discuss challenges we faced in solving such a highly nonlinear and dynamic problem: in particular, 1) the challenge of dealing with a high number of scalar components (up to 15), which dynamically changes, when particles move or merge; and 2) the development of a block preconditioner for the solution of the Jacobian matrix, which we evaluate in a matrix-free fashion.    
Our solver employs deal.II for spacial discretization and adaptive mesh refinement as well as Trilinos’ non-linear and linear solver capabilities. Results will also contain performance analyses conducted on SuperMUC-NG supercomputer.

In this talk, I will show you some efforts to make the supercomputer more usable and productive in the viewpoint of the software environment. First, we have been working to support important open-source software (OSS) packages including libraries, tools, and applications, some of which are optimized for Fugaku. These OSS packages are provided via Spack.  Second, we are working to port and support commercial software on Fugaku in cooperation with Fujitsu and software vendors. Gaussian is the first example and available since Nov. 2022. Finally, we contribute to develop the Arm software ecosystem for HPC. For example, we started  a work of improving the LLVM compiler by implementing more effective optimization feature for A64FX.

Moreover, when suitably designed, they can also be employed to approximate functions while reproducing an expected structure or property. An example is working with symplectic neural networks to approximate Hamiltonian systems' flow maps while preserving the model's interpretability. Thus, neural networks can be relevant tools for physical problems as well. In this talk, we present a formalism for designing neural networks that satisfy specific desired properties. We then demonstrate their effectiveness in the problem of discovering the dynamics of a mechanical system while maintaining some expected features.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75364' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1317)' class='star'><span class='star1317'>&star;</span></a> Riley J.

RandNLA algorithms are unparalleled in their capacity for producing approximate solutions to problems such as low-rank approximation. For suitably structured problems, they can even offer substantial speedups over deterministic methods without sacrificing accuracy.    
  This talk describes the philosophy of RandLAPACK – an aspiring standard library for RandNLA. Through careful identification of motifs occurring across RandNLA, it is possible to articulate many algorithms without making strong assumptions on the implementations of their core subroutines. This motivates RandLAPACK’s object-oriented design: interfaces are used to specify the semantics of tasks, while algorithms manifest as interface-conformant classes. In order for an algorithm to be executed it is necessary to instantiate it as an object in-memory. By allowing these objects to be stateful, we are able to achieve excellent performance without complicating the semantics of the task that an algorithm needs to carry out.

A stochastic algorithm without time discretization error has been recently introduced (Muscato et al. Kin.Relat.

Numerical experiments have been performed in the case of a GaAs Resonant Tunneling Diode (RTD), improving the CPU consumption   (Muscato, J. Comput. Electron., vol 20., pagg. 2062-2069, 2021). In such nano-devices the presence of very high and rapidly varying electric fields is the cause of thermal heating of the carriers and the crystal lattice. In fact, the external electric field transfers energy to the electrons and in turn to the lattice through the scattering mechanism. This self-heating process can influence significantly the electrical behaviour because the dissipated electrical energy causes a temperature rise in the device resulting in increased power dissipation. The mechanism through which lattice self-heating occurs is that of electron scattering with phonons, and therefore a model which deliberately incorporates all scattering events will also capture such energy dissipation details.

An adaptive event-triggered mechanism is developed for the considered system to reduce the number of triggering and communication burdens. Adaptive feedback control is constructed to force the output trajectories to track the bounded reference input signal even in the presence of external disturbance. Further, the tracking control objective transformed into stochastic stabilization of the considered system. For the stabilization analysis, the stochastic fuzzy system does not share the same membership functions as the proposed control.  The sufficient stabilization conditions are developed in the form of linear matrix inequalities together with the help of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and some integral inequalities.  Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to some engineering stochastic models to validate efficiency and practicability.

Myers<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-340.html'>ECMI: Perspectives and Successes of Mathematical Challenges in Industrial Applications  - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Tackling environmental challenges is this generation’s defining task (EC Green Deal 2020). The goal of holding global warming “to well below 2°C” (IPCC 2018; Paris Agreement 2015), can now only be achieved through the extraction of atmospheric greenhouse gases in tandem with emission reductions and a range of other measures. Similarly the goal of a “toxic free environment” requires the removal of a multitude of existing contaminants.  The focus of this talk will be the development and solution of mathematical models for the removal of contaminants by column sorption. Column sorption involves passing a contaminated fluid through a porous media contained in a column. The contaminants are adsorbed by the porous media. This is a common process, capable of removing a multitude of contaminants. However, industrial use is restricted due to a large increase in running costs. Further, laboratory experiments on small scale equipment, a necessary precursor to building the full size version, do not scale up in the predicted manner.  The mathematical description of column sorption involves coupling advection-diffusion equations to sink (removal) equations, all applied over an evolving domain. In the talk we will describe our modelling, analytical and numerical solution techniques as well as experiments currently being employed to help improve and optimise this process.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75749' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(593)' class='star'><span class='star593'>&star;</span></a> Siva Nadarajah  <span id='bitlink-3096'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3096)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3096' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3096)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Kinetic Energy Preservation and Entropy Stable Modal Flux Reconstruction Formulations</b><br />Siva Nadarajah<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-130.html'>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>The flux reconstruction method has gained popularity in the research community as it recovers promising high-order methods through modally filtered correction fields, such as the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, on unstructured grids over complex geometries. Under a class of energy stable flux reconstruction (ESFR) schemes also known as Vincent-Castonguay-Jameson-Huynh (VCJH) schemes, the flux reconstruction method allows for larger time-steps than DG while ensuring linear stability on linear elements. Alternatively, for nonlinear problems, split forms emerged as the popular approach proving nonlinear stability for unsteady problems on coarse unstructured grids; albeit only having been proved for the strong form DG scheme and numerically shown for the $g_2$-lumped Lobatto strong form ESFR scheme for the Euler equations. Incorporating split forms with VCJH schemes, alike Ranocha and Abe, generally lead to unstable discretizations.  Over the past year we have developed a new Nonlinearly Stable Flux Reconstruction approach based on modal uncollocated ESFR schemes in split forms that ensure energy and entropy stability. This new approach simplifies to VCJH type schemes for linear problems, but for nonlinear problems, it ensures nonlinear stability and the correct orders of convergence. In this work, we show analytically that with a suitable interface flux the scheme guarantees kinetic energy preservation for the stated Nonlinearly Stable Flux Reconstruction framework.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75418' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1114)' class='star'><span class='star1114'>&star;</span></a> James Nagy  <span id='bitlink-3097'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3097)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3097' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3097)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Computational Imaging with Low Precision Arithmetic</b><br />James Nagy<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-245.html'>Recent Advances in Inverse Problems for Computational Imaging - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Although some work has been done to exploit mixed precision computations for inverse problems, most previous work focuses on particular applications, such as image registration and image reconstruction.

A kinetic ion -- fluid electron model is assumed; the Leonard-Bernstein-Fokker-Planck operator is discretized using a structure preserving Chang-Cooper method; and the updated solution is truncated using a local macroscopic conservative low rank tensor method. Preliminary numerical results are presented to demonstrate these properties.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75197' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1551)' class='star'><span class='star1551'>&star;</span></a> Keerthana Nanjundan  <span id='bitlink-3101'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3101)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3101' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3101)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Input-Output Finite Time Stabilization of Sampled Data Control for Semi Markov T-S Fuzzy System with Affine Matched Membership Function</b><br />Keerthana Nanjundan<br />Friday, March 3 12:50 AM&ndash;1:05 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-341.html'>Software and Computational Methods for Special Functions</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>This article aims to examine the problem of Input-output finite-time stabilization of sampled-data control for semi-Markov fuzzy systems with time delay and disturbance. In most general cases, mode-dependent non-linear systems are difficult to study. In order to deal with this issue, nonlinear systems can be linearised by fuzzy with membership functions. To be specific, affine matched membership function for system and controller is considered. To stabilize and reduce the communication burden, sampled data feedback control is utilized for the considered system. By endowing Lyapunov stability theory, a set of sufficient conditions is developed in the frame of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee that the fuzzy system is Input Output Finite time stable. Finally, two numerical examples that are useful in the field of engineering are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Understanding the droplet dynamics is crucial to improve the efficacy of these processes. Hybrid rockets present a promising alternative to purely liquid-fueled engines as common hybrid fuels are environmentally friendly, abundant, and easy to process and store. Paraffin wax is a prominent candidate among high regression rate fuels for hybrid rocket engines [M. Karabeyoglu and B. J. Cantwell, “Combustion of liquefying hybrid propellants: Part 2, stability of liquid films”, Journal of Propulsion and Power, vol. 18, no. 3, pp. 621–630, 2002]. The atomization of the paraffin wax that begins with the droplet formation and pinch-off, enables rapid burning and generates a much more specific thrust than other fuels.  We present a one-dimensional model to simulate the droplet pinch-off in a quiescent environment using front tracking [D. K. Nathawani and M. G. Knepley, “Droplet formation simulation using mixed finite  elements”, Physics of Fluids, vol. 34, no. 6, p. 064105, 2022]. The model is verified using the method of manufactured solution and validated against laboratory experiments. We propose a self-consistent algorithm with adaptively refined mesh. Furthermore, we expand the model for droplets in a continuous flow to incorporate the effects of shear force on droplet evolution.

The widely used principal component analysis (PCA) achieves this for combustion data by transforming the original thermo-chemical state space into a low-dimensional manifold with eigenvectors of the data covariance. However, this may not effectively capture the stiff chemical dynamics when the reaction zones are spatiotemporally localized. Alternatively, a co-kurtosis PCA (CoK-PCA), wherein the principal components are obtained from singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matricized co-kurtosis tensor, demonstrated greater accuracy in capturing the stiff dynamics. However, both methods incur significant errors due to a linear reconstruction of data onto the original manifold. Nonlinear methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) can improve reconstruction accuracy over linear methods, thereby allowing further dimensionality reduction of the original manifold. We use homogeneous reactor data of premixed ethylene-air to investigate (1) the efficacy of CoK-PCA-ANN relative to PCA-ANN and (2) ANN reconstruction relative to linear reconstruction by comparing reconstruction errors of the thermo-chemical state, species production, and heat release rates. Our results show that, while ANN outperforms linear reconstruction in general, the proposed CoK-PCA-ANN captures the stiff dynamics better than PCA-ANN.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75390' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1262)' class='star'><span class='star1262'>&star;</span></a> Pratik Nayak  <span id='bitlink-3109'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3109)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3109' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3109)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Batched Solvers and Preconditioners in Ginkgo.</b><br />Pratik Nayak<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-277.html'>Progresses on Batched Linear Solver Algorithms - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we will elaborate on the batched functionality in Ginkgo, a high performance numerical linear algebra library.

In this talk we will showcase the advantages of using an iterative solver in a batched fashion, and elaborate on the implementation and the challenges. We will show that we can achieve significant speedups compared to the dense and direct methods within our applications. Finally, we will show some techniques for enhancing and accelerating these batched iterative solvers with batched preconditioners and present the results for general matrices as well as matrices from specific applications.

Our particular interest is the surface-quasi-geostrophic flow model (SQG), which is a scalar nonlinear conservation law in two space dimensions. The velocity field and the viscosity term of the SQG equation involve calculating the fractional derivative of the solution, which is not trivial to compute numerically. For this purpose, we use Dunford--Taylor representations of fractional operators. Strong-stability-preserving Runge--Kutta methods are used in time and the continuous finite element method is used in space. The method retains the invariant domain property under the usual CFL condition and has a second-order accuracy in space. The method is tested by solving several benchmark problems.

A plethora of work is done to find conditions that foster synchronization in diffusively coupled systems, in which the coupling vanishes on the synchronization manifold. However, there are few analytical approaches to understanding synchronization behavior in non-diffusively coupled networks. Motivated by neuronal models connected through chemical synapses, we investigate sufficient conditions for non-diffusively coupled oscillators to synchronize globally. Our global stability method follows an analytical contraction-based approach that explicitly relates synchronization to systems' intrinsic dynamics, coupling dynamics, and the underlying network topology. We compare this method to a local or linear stability approach called the master stability function, a numerical method that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for network synchronization.

The brain is capable of such uncertainty estimation from data, but the principles underlying this feat and its implementation in a compact, low-power hardware remains a challenge. In this presentation, I will first introduce Neural Sampling Machines (NSM), a stochastic binary neural network inspired by the stochastic behavior of biological neurons that uses to perform probabilistic inference. We demonstrate a novel hardware fabric that can implement NSMs by exploiting the stochasticity in the synaptic connections. We experimentally demonstrate an hybrid stochastic synapse by pairing a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based analog weight cell with a two-terminal stochastic selector element.   We show that the stochastic switching characteristic of the selector between the insulator and the metallic states resembles the multiplicative synaptic noise of the NSM. The stochastic NSM can not only perform highly accurate image classification with 98.25% accuracy on standard MNIST dataset, but also estimate the uncertainty in prediction (measured in terms of the entropy of prediction) when the digits of the MNIST dataset are rotated. Building such a probabilistic hardware platform that can support neuroscience inspired models can enhance the learning and inference capability of the current artificial intelligence (AI).

EIT may be mathematically abstracted as the severely ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem of recovering the interior conductivity coefficient (the parameter, a function) of an elliptic partial differential equation from its Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary map (the data, a linear operator). Existing methods for this problem are highly sensitive to noisy boundary measurements and tend to suffer from low accuracy. This work bypasses expensive iterative optimization or Bayesian inference solution approaches by instead directly learning the data-to-parameter solution operator of the inverse problem from training data. Theoretical analysis based on rigorous direct reconstruction algorithms for EIT establishes that the solution operator is well-approximated by a new class of neural operators suitable for operator-valued data. Numerical evidence suggests that incorporating theoretical and EIT-specific problem structure into these neural operator architectures can lead to highly accurate trained models.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75416' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1505)' class='star'><span class='star1505'>&star;</span></a> Philipp Neumann  <span id='bitlink-3114'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3114)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3114' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3114)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stencil Operator Inference Using Regression Techniques</b><br />Philipp Neumann<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-331.html'>Stencil Computation for Scientific Applications - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>Due to rapid developments in the field of machine learning and data science, the derivation of mathematical relationships by learning ODEs or PDEs from field data has gained much attraction in recent years.

I present recent work on the inference of stencil expressions from prescribed field data, i.e. learning directly a discrete relationship from the data. Focussing on the use of regression techniques, I discuss challenges such as the handling of noise in the data, stability of the derived stencil expressions or the treatment of heterogeneous coefficients in space or time. I will base my discussion on various well-known first- and second-order differential problems and their solutions which are used to generate the field data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75736' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1925)' class='star'><span class='star1925'>&star;</span></a> Samuel J.

Load-carrying effects on high Reynolds number flight have been studied, but the fluid dynamics of load-carrying by low Reynolds number microorganisms have not. We studied low Reynolds number load-carrying using unicellular choanoflagellates, which wave a flagellum to swim and create a water current transporting bacterial prey to a food-capturing collar of microvilli.  A regularized Stokeslet framework was used to model the hydrodynamics of a swimming choanoflagellate with bacterial prey on its collar. Both the model and microvideography of choanoflagellates showed that swimming speed decreases as number of prey being carried increases.  Flux of water into the capture zone is reduced by bacteria on the collar, which redirect the water flow and occlude parts of the collar. Feeding efficiency (prey captured per work to produce the feeding current) is decreased more by large prey, prey in the plane of flagellar beating, and prey near microvillar tips than by prey in other locations.  Some choanoflagellates can attach themselves to surfaces. We found that the reduction in flux due to bacterial prey on the collars of these attached thecate cells was similar to the reduction in flux for swimmers.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75250' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2040)' class='star'><span class='star2040'>&star;</span></a> Haoran Ni  <span id='bitlink-3120'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3120)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3120' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3120)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Normalizing Flows based Mutual Information Estimation</b><br />Haoran Ni<br />Thursday, March 2 5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-425.html'>Student Days: Student Chapter Presentations - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>Mutual Information (MI), as a measure of mutual dependence on random quantities without specific modelling assumptions, plays an important role in many scientific disciplines. However, estimating mutual information numerically from high-dimensional data remains a difficult problem. Classic non-parametric estimators of entropy and mutual information depend either on density estimation and Monte Carlo integration, or on the computation of k nearest neighbours (kNN). The first type of algorithm suffers from the curse of dimensionality, while kNN methods lack accuracy in the presence of correlation. Non-parametric estimators are usually fast and accurate without further assumptions, but they do not scale well for small-sized samples in high-dimensional spaces. This impediment has motivated the parametric estimators, which take advantage of the expressive power of deep learning architectures in parameterizing the space of functions, to find the variational bounds for mutual information. Some recent research include MINE (Belghazi et al., 2018; Song and Ermon, 2019), Contrastive Predictive Coding (van den Oord et al., 2018), DEMI (Liao et al., 2020) and Normalizing Flows based entropy estimators (Ao and Li, 2021). As shown by Song and Ermon (2019), these models based on discriminative learning can introduce high variance in the estimation, while “generative” models such as entropy estimators based on normalizing flows need to learn three distributions to compute mutual information. We propose a principled mutual information estimator based on a generalization of normalizing flows, a deep generative model that has gained considerable popularity in recent years. This estimator not only estimates the marginal and joint entropy in a systematic way, but also uses an autoregressive structure to obtain better performance in estimating mutual information. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed estimator exhibits improved bias-variance trade-offs on standard benchmark tasks.

The problem is further complicated by considering a set up in which the governing equations contain further auxiliary parameters which are also unknown, but are assumed to be of little interest.  To account for the additional model uncertainty in the governing equations we employ the so-called Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach. We show that failure to take into account the additional model uncertainty at the OED stage relates in a sub-optimal design, while failure to take into account at the inference stage relates in significant over confidence in heavily biased estimates, i.e., an infeasible posterior. In this talk, we consider the optimal design of infinite-dimensional nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems. We derive a marginalised A-optimality criterion and develop an efficient computational approach to solve the associated optimisation problem. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by considering the estimation of a Robin coefficient for the Poisson problem when the (unknown) internal conductivity is treated as an auxiliary parameter.

Nevertheless, the definition of a pH system consists of two objects: the input-output dynamics and an energy function that is typically called the Hamiltonian. If we thus measure the approximation quality only with respect to the input-output dynamics, then the approximation of the Hamiltonian is not reflected at all. This is particularly relevant since recent results [Breiten and Unger, Automatica 142, 2022] demonstrate that modifying the Hamiltonian of the full order model (FOM) may yield better reduced order models (ROMs), at least if only the input-output dynamics are analyzed. In this talk, we make a first step towards the dual-objective minimization problem of optimal approximation of the input-output dynamics and the Hamiltonian by noticing that in the pH ROM, we can modify the Hamiltonian without changing the system dynamics. Thus, for a given pH ROM, we can search for the reduced Hamiltonian that best approximates the FOM Hamiltonian. We prove that the resulting optimization problem is strictly convex and uniquely solvable. Moreover, we propose a numerical algorithm to solve the minimization problem and demonstrate its applicability with numerical examples.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75370' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1947)' class='star'><span class='star1947'>&star;</span></a> Evie Nielen  <span id='bitlink-3123'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3123)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3123' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3123)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multilevel Basis Reduction</b><br />Evie Nielen<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1446)' class='star'><span class='star1446'>&star;</span></a> Eric Nielsen  <span id='bitlink-3124'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3124)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3124' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3124)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Simulations of Human-Scale Mars Lander Descent Trajectories</b><br />Eric Nielsen<br />Monday, February 27 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-318.html'>Computational Science at Extreme Scales</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>To achieve human exploration on Mars, new approaches to entry, descent, and landing are necessary in order to support delivery of substantially larger payloads to the surface.  In this presentation, large-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a human-scale Mars lander configuration descending through the Martian atmosphere with the use of retropropulsion are described.  The CFD solver is coupled with a trajectory analysis package which is used to provide the necessary control inputs to maintain the desired flight path.  Simulations are performed using thousands of GPUs on the Summit system located at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing facility.  An overview of the GPU-based implementation is presented, and aerodynamic performance and characteristics of the highly dynamic flowfield are compared with those observed at static freestream conditions as studied in prior computational campaigns.

The plates move vertically with a prescribed oscillatory motion and horizontally by their self-induced thrust forces. The trailing vorticity is simulated using a separated vortex sheet model. The fluid motion near the plates is resolved using corrected standard quadratures. The flow is computed for two, three and four in-line plates. New results are obtained for the stability of the equilibrium positions behind the leading plate: as the number of plates increase, and as the oscillation amplitude decreases, the domain of attraction of the equilibria shrinks and the number of unstable trajectories increases. A simple control mechanism to avoid instability is explored.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75517' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(997)' class='star'><span class='star997'>&star;</span></a> Jonas Nitzler  <span id='bitlink-3126'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3126)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3126' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3126)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Bayesian Multifidelity Inverse Analysis for Expensive, Non-Differentiable, Physics-Based Solvers in High Dimensions</b><br />Jonas Nitzler<br />Thursday, March 2 3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-218.html'>Bayesian Inference and Density Estimation</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>Computationally expensive, large-scale, numerical models with high-dimensional (stochastic) model input pose some of the biggest challenges for (Bayesian) inverse analysis. The solution process is further impeded when model derivatives are inaccessible, as is often the case in  legacy codes.  We propose Bayesian multifidelity inverse analysis (BMFIA), which overcomes the difficulties mentioned above by employing computationally inexpensive, lower-fidelity models and constructing a multifidelity likelihood function. The approach builds upon previous developments of the authors in the  field of uncertainty quantification. The multifidelity likelihood is learned robustly, and potentially adaptively, from a small number of high-fidelity simulations. It incorporates the epistemic uncertainty that arises from the small amount of high-fidelity data and can also serve as an objective function for deterministic optimization schemes. We enrich the multi-fidelity dependence with low-dimensional, informative input features, which increases the formulation’s accuracy.  The inference process can be performed using state-of-the-art sampling-based or variational methods  for Bayesian inverse analysis and requires only evaluations of the lower-fidelity model(s), which, when appropriately selected, can also furnish derivatives.  We demonstrate our approach on large-scale biomechanical and coupled multi-physics problems and  compare it with state-of-the-art single- and multi-fidelity methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75534' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1932)' class='star'><span class='star1932'>&star;</span></a> Reuben W.

The method requires solving the OCP for several low-fidelity spatial grids and quadrature formulae for the objective functional. All the computed solutions are then linearly combined to get a final approximation which, under suitable regularity assumptions, preserves the same accuracy of fine tensor product approximations, while drastically reducing the computational cost. The combination technique involves only tensor product quadrature formulae, thus the discretized OCPs preserve the convexity of the continuous OCP. Hence, the combination technique avoids the inconveniences of Multilevel Monte Carlo and/or sparse grids approaches, but remains suitable for high dimensional problems.  We will present an a-priori procedure to choose the most important mixed differences and an asymptotic convergence analysis, which states that the asymptotic convergence rate is exclusively determined by the spatial solver.

This phenomena reduces the skin friction of the overlying fluid and has been shown to delay laminar-turbulent transition. Research into the macroscopic layout of SHSs as a means of passive flow control, however, remains relatively under investigated.    
Here, topology optimization is used to design an inhomogeneous SHS that can further delay spatially developing modal transition in channel flows; a highly non-linear and non-convex optimization problem. The influence of the SHS is modelled using a spatially varying slip length on the walls, forming a 2D  optimization domain.  The spectral element solver Nek5000 is used to first establish a steady baseflow in a wall-bounded channel, and then conduct unsteady direct numerical simulations of the transition to turbulence. The optimization procedure uses the adjoint-variable method to compute sensitivities and uses a checkpointing strategy to overcome the data storage requirements of the unsteady adjoint simulation. This methodology has been successfully applied to produce a surfaces that moves the transition location 29% further downstream when compared to a homogeneous counterpart by inhibiting the growth of secondary instability modes.

We present a family of algorithmic ideas where computationally cheap iterative approximations are used to solve most instances of aspects of the code. Where convergence isn’t reached we fall back to a more expensive but robust method.  This pattern allows us to take advantage of modern parallel architectures.    
Geometry distance checks are calculated using a distance minimisation algorithm.  The precision of the result from this minimisation can be tuned to produce a result only as precise as needed.    
We support triangulated particles with efficient implicit DEM code using a multiresolution and multiprecision hierarchy. Early iterations of the implicit solve yield an initial guess and thus reduce the number of later, more expensive iterations that are required to converge to the correct solution.    
Finally, we show a local time stepping scheme where the time step size is selected optimistically.  Where this results in invalid physical states the state of each particle is rolled back and a more simple method (half the time step size until a valid state is found) is used.  The optimistic selection of time step size for local clusters of particles can end up advancing some particles too far and missing interactions with new particles entering the local cluster.  In this case we roll back to the time of the new interaction and resimulate from there.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75747' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(219)' class='star'><span class='star219'>&star;</span></a> Andrew Nonaka  <span id='bitlink-3131'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3131)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3131' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3131)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>AMReX: An Overview of Recent Software Developments and Scientific Applications</b><br />Andrew Nonaka<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-48.html'>High-Performance Computing in the FASTMath SciDAC-5 Institute - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>In this talk I will give an overview of current features and scientific partnerships involving the AMReX software framework.

However, finding good CVs, for example in the sense of retaining slow dynamical time scales of the full system, is a highly non-trivial problem.    
In this talk, I will present recent progress on the determination of CVs using the projection formalism for stochastic dynamics developed by [Legoll and Lelièvre, Nonlinearity (2010)] and [Zhang et al, Faraday Discuss. (2016)]. This formalism amounts to projecting the Koopman generator of the full system onto the space of functions which only depend on the CV space. The first result I will show is an error estimate comparing the slow time scales of the projected and the full system. We arrive at a Galerkin-type estimate, bounding the error in terms of the projection error for dominant eigenfunctions [Nüske et al, Entropy (2021)].    
Then, I will move on to show how a data-driven approximation of the projected generator can be obtained by a technique called generator extended dynamic mode decomposition (gEDMD) [Klus, Nüske, et al, Physica D (2020)]. This method can also be formulated if a tensor product basis is used as Galerkin subspace [Lücke and Nüske, J. Nonlinear Sci. (2022)], enabling the use of powerful approximation spaces. Finally, I will discuss bounds for the estimation error of the gEDMD method in terms of the amount of simulation data [Nüske et al, arXiv:2108.07102 (2021)].    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75423' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(200)' class='star'><span class='star200'>&star;</span></a> Thomas O'Leary-Roseberry  <span id='bitlink-3134'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3134)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3134' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3134)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Learning High-Dimensional Parametric Derivatives with Neural Operators</b><br />Thomas O'Leary-Roseberry<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;9:35 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-44.html'>Operator Learning in the Physical and Data Sciences - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>In this talk we will present efficient strategies for learning high-dimensional derivative information via neural operators. By exploiting low-dimensional information of a high-dimensional map, if it exists, one can both generate and learn high dimensional derivative information where the dominant computational costs can be made independent of the discretization dimensions. Numerical results demonstrate that this additional derivative information improves the function approximation, and additionally neural operators that are not trained on derivative information are unlikely to produce reliable derivatives with respect to high-dimensional parameters. Numerical examples will demonstrate how these derivative informed neural operators can be used to accelerate the solutions of stochastic optimization problems and high-dimensional inference problems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75264' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(536)' class='star'><span class='star536'>&star;</span></a> Daniel O'Malley  <span id='bitlink-3135'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3135)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3135' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3135)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Subsurface Flow and Transport with Differentiable Programming and Quantum Computing</b><br />Daniel O'Malley<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-117.html'>Data Science Solutions for Earth Sciences – a Path to a Sustainable Future - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Many subsurface flow applications involve components where physical laws are well understood and other components where the physical laws are either poorly understood or not applicable. Numerical modeling excels at the former whereas interpolating data with machine learning (ML) excels at the latter, but neither approach can tackle these components simultaneously. Existing ML approaches (often called physics-informed ML, or PIML) to handling these types of components simultaneously are minor tweaks to standard ML methods (e.g., PIML might use physics data to train or a loss function that encourages the ML to obey an equation without any accuracy guarantees). Tweaking black-box ML models is fundamentally limited because "big data does not interpret itself"–meaningful, interpretable structure in models is a necessity to improve predictability, enable human understanding, and maximize the impact of small data. We show how Differentiable Programming (DP) enables us to to meld trustworthy numerical modeling with trainable ML to enhance workflows for physical model development, inverse analysis, and machine learning. This talk will also consider applications of quantum computing to subsurface flow.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75393' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1445)' class='star'><span class='star1445'>&star;</span></a> Jared O'Neal  <span id='bitlink-3136'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3136)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3136' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3136)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adapting Experimental Science Tools and Techniques to Computational Sciences</b><br />Jared O'Neal<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-318.html'>Computational Science at Extreme Scales</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>As computational mathematics, science, and engineering problems become larger, more ambitious, and more complex, it is increasingly important to develop and use tools and techniques that ensure that computational science research is based on a strong foundation of general, low-level scientific best practices.

The basic idea is to split a signal into two pieces, apply separate linear transformations to each piece, and then linearly re-combine the output. The matrix corresponding to the Discrete Fourier Transform can be analytically factored into a product of log(N) block-diagonal butterfly matrices. Generalizations of such matrix factorizations yield what are now known as “butterfly factorizations”, and have found applications in PDE, integral equations, signals processing, special function transforms, etc. They often allow for the compression of an N x N matrix into a product of log(N) matrices, each with O(N) sparsity.

Our three-dimensional models including all relevant physics and covering long simulation times demonstrate how the subset of progenitors with strong magnetic fields and high rotational energies can be responsible for producing particularly high explosion energies and for playing an important role in the chemical enrichment of early galaxies with heavy elements in ways that are not accessible to ordinary, primarily neutrino-driven explosions.

K., Particle-in-cell charged-particle simulations, plus Monte Carlo collisions with neutral atoms, PIC-MCC. Trans. Plasma Sci., 19(2), 1991], which simulate the motion of a large number of computational particles, each of which represents a large number of actual molecules, atoms, or electrons.    
Particle-particle and particle-surface collisions in such codes are performed in a stochastic manner: a single process is simulated for each collision, with the process being randomly chosen based on the probability of it taking place. In the present work a new collision and boundary condition simulation scheme, dubbed "event splitting" [Oblapenko, G. et al, Hedging direct simulation Monte Carlo bets via event splitting, J. Comput. Phys., 466, 2022], is investigated. It simulates multiple events simultaneously via splitting of the particles involved in the collision and has been shown to significantly reduce the level of stochastic noise in unsteady breakdown simulations.    
The scheme is applied to 1-D modelling of discharges in rarefied argon and helium plasmas, and compared to standard PIC-DSMC collision routines in terms of computational efficiency and numerical noise.

One of the key assumptions in the stability and convergence analysis of these methods is the ability of finding global minimizers.  However, such an assumption is often not feasible when the regularizer is a black box or non-convex, making the search for global minimizers of the involved Tikhonov functional a challenging task. Instead, standard minimization schemes are applied which typically only guarantee that a critical point is found. To address this issue, we study stability and convergence properties of critical points of Tikhonov functionals with a possible non-convex regularizer. We show that even in such cases a full convergence analysis can be given and we provide numerical simulations which support our findings.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75242' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1120)' class='star'><span class='star1120'>&star;</span></a> Christian Offen  <span id='bitlink-3142'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3142)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3142' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3142)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Learning of Euler-Lagrange Dynamics from Data</b><br />Christian Offen<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-246.html'>Recent Advances in Data-Driven Control of Complex Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>The principle of least action is one of the most fundamental physical principles. It says that among all possible motions connecting two points in a phase space, the system will exhibit those motions which extremise an action functional.  Many qualitative features of dynamical systems, such as the presence of conservation laws and energy balance equations, are related to the existence of an action functional, i.e. the presence of variational structure.  In this talk I will show how to learn dynamical systems from data while incorporating variational structure and why it is important to do so. Moreover, I will demonstrate that when trajectories of a learned system are computed numerically, then discretisation errors can be much bigger than expected rendering predictions unsuable. As a remedy, I will introduce our new machine learning approach, coined  Lagrangian Shadow Integration. It compensates for discretisation errors and enables highly accurate long-term predictions of dynamics.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75572' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(152)' class='star'><span class='star152'>&star;</span></a> Laurel Ohm  <span id='bitlink-3143'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3143)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3143' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3143)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Results on Classical Elastohydrodynamics for a Swimming Filament</b><br />Laurel Ohm<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-34.html'>Computational Methods and Analysis for Biological Applications in Stokes Flow - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>We consider two models of an immersed inextensible filament undergoing planar motion in $\mathbb{R}^3$: (1) the classical elastohydrodynamic model using resistive force theory coupled with Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, and (2) a novel curve evolution formulation incorporating the effects of linear viscoelasticity.

This model requires the solution of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) describing conservation of mass, momentum, and thermal energy, along with various reduced forms of Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic fields. The resulting systems are characterized by strong nonlinear and nonsymmetric coupling of fluid and electromagnetic phenomena, as well as the significant range of time- and length-scales that these interactions produce. These characteristics make scalable and efficient iterative solution, of the resulting poorly-conditioned discrete systems, extremely difficult. In this talk we consider the use of block preconditioners for solving the coupled physics block systems.    
The block preconditioner considered here is based on an approximate operator splitting approach which can isolate certain coupled systems, allowing them to be handled independently. Here we use the splitting to create two independent 2x2 block systems, a magnetics-flow system and a magnetics-constraint system.    
We demonstrate this approach for various resistive MHD problems that are relevant to magnetic confinement fusion applications and compare the performance with alternative preconditioning methods.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75293' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(429)' class='star'><span class='star429'>&star;</span></a> Eda Oktay  <span id='bitlink-3145'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3145)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3145' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3145)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Solving Total Least Squares Problems Using Mixed Precision</b><br />Eda Oktay<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-95.html'>Mixed Precision Algorithms in Numerical Linear Algebra - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>With the recent emergence of mixed precision hardware, there has been a  renewed interest in its use for solving numerical linear algebra  problems fast and accurately.

FWI is used mainly for imaging the earth's subdomains, but also has applications in noninvasive neuroimaging and high-resolution ultrasound breast imaging. The 3D FWI is an inverse approach that requires several iterations of costly acoustic or elastic wave propagations and gradient calculations. Here we describe an open-source FWI software implementation, based on the Firedrake Framework, that runs on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes and employs higher-order mass lumped elements, and we compare its performance with high-order spectral element methods on quadrilateral and hexahedron structured meshes. For the unstructured mesh, we reduce degrees of freedom based on an automatic mesh refinement that adapts to subsurface material heterogeneity. We illustrate our results of FWI on different realistic geophysical examples while discussing computational performance on different computer architectures.

In most cases, the GPUs  are integrated as discrete server-type GPUs that are attached to the nodes as coprocessors  and provide the lion’s share of the theoretical compute performance. This concept allows  to significantly increase the theoretical compute power, however, it poses a challenge to  the scientific software developers that need to redesign their software such that it can  benefit from the additional resources. An attractive strategy is to use the GPUs for the  computationally most expensive part of an application. For computational fluid dynamics  (CFD) simulations, a substantial part of the overall effort is spent on the solution of the  system of linear equations arising from the discretized transport equations.

The method of regularized Stokeslets has been heavily applied to micro-scale biofluids problems such as microorgianism locomotion. It is based on the boundary integral form of the Stokes equations where the singular fundamental solution (the "Stokeslet") is replaced with a smooth approximation. The method can be modified such that certain boundary conditions are satisfied automatically via the addition of an appropriate "image system" to the regularized Stokeslet. Here, we focus on the computation of fluid flows due to distributions of forces within a fluid-filled, spherical cavity because no regularized image system has been derived for this specific setting and because of its importance to flows driven by active structures within cells. We present two example problems in this context: the flow due to a translating particle and the flow due to a relaxing flexible filament contained in the cavity.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75249' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1764)' class='star'><span class='star1764'>&star;</span></a> Sheehan Olver  <span id='bitlink-3149'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3149)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3149' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3149)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Sparse Spectral Methods for Power Law Kernels</b><br />Sheehan Olver<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-388.html'>Recent Advances on Integral Equation and Spectral Methods for Inhomogeneous Problems - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>We review recently derived sparse spectral methods for integral equations involving power law kernels, including the case of multivariate disks/balls.

Powerful costless abstractions, metaprogramming and multiple dispatch enable writing a single code that is suitable for both productive prototyping on a single CPU thread and large scale production runs on GPU or CPU supercomputers. High performance stencil computations can be expressed with math-close notation in hardware-agnostic kernels for which launch parameters are automatically derivable from the kernel arguments. Halo updates required for distributed memory parallelization can be triggered with a single function call, can fully and automatically overlap with computations and reach performance close to hardware limit. We outline the wide applicability of our approach by reporting on multiple multi-xPU solvers for geosciences as, e.g., 3D solvers for poro-visco-elastic two-phase flow and for reactive porosity waves. The solvers achieve high performance and scale close to ideally on thousands of NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre. Moreover, we have shown in recent contributions that our approach is naturally in no way limited to geosciences: we have showcased a computational cognitive neuroscience application modelling visual target selection and a quantum fluid dynamics solver using the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevski equation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75233' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(125)' class='star'><span class='star125'>&star;</span></a> David Omogbhe  <span id='bitlink-3151'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3151)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3151' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3151)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Inverse Source Problem for Linearly Anisotropic Sources in Absorbing and Scattering Medium</b><br />David Omogbhe<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-28.html'>New Methods for Solving Inverse Problems in Imaging</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>We considered in a two dimensional absorbing and scattering medium, an inverse source problem in the stationary radiative transport, where the source is generated by a scalar and vector field.The medium has an anisotropic scattering property, the attenuating and scattering properties of the medium are assumed known and the unknown scalar and isotropic vector field sources are to be reconstructed.

Similarly in climate modeling, high-fidelity E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model) simulations can resolve small flow structures but are very expensive. Hence, fast and generalizable surrogate models are needed to alleviate the cost of computationally taxing processes. The intrinsic discontinuous nature of the microstructures and the presence of high frequency features in climate prognostic variables make the training of the surrogate model cumbersome. In this study, we develop an algorithm that pairs a convolutional autoencoder with a deep neural operator (DeepONet) to learn the dynamic evolution of systems in a lower dimensional latent space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework through key examples in material science and climate modeling. For the first problem, we train the proposed model to learn the dynamic evolution of two-phase mixtures. The trained model is used to replace the high-fidelity simulation solver in interpolation tasks and is integrated with the numerical solver for accelerating extrapolation tasks. In the second problem, we train the model to predict corrections to the atmospheric states obtained by the coarse E3SM model. The trained model is able to forecast extreme events like hurricane and tropical cyclones and replaces the `nudging module’ in the E3SM.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75203' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(286)' class='star'><span class='star286'>&star;</span></a> Dominique Orban  <span id='bitlink-3153'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3153)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3153' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3153)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Proximal Quasi-Newton Methods for Nonsmooth Regularized Bound-Constrained Optimization</b><br />Dominique Orban<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-63.html'>Algorithms for Nonsmooth, Nonconvex Optimization - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>We develop an interior-point method for nonsmooth regularized bound-constrained optimization problems of the form $x\geq0$.

Unfortunately, time and budget constraints make operating these experiments at a wide range of conditions intractable, thus limiting the amount of data collected. In this talk, we consider an application of Bayesian optimal experimental design to identify conditions that are expected to be most informative, measured by the expected information gain. We focus on inferring specific parameters of a chemically reacting system subject to both parametric and model uncertainty. A physics-based model was developed to simulate the gas-phase reactions occurring between highly reactive intermediate species in a high-pressure photolysis reactor coupled to a mass spectrometer. The measured time-of-flight mass spectrum evolves in both time and energy producing a high-dimensional output at each design. We discuss how accurate low-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional mass spectrum are necessary for computing the expected information gain. Additionally, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore over the constrained design space. We present our results, discuss trade-offs during the optimization, and outline a workflow for efficiently computing optimal experimental designs for high-dimensional models.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75481' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1919)' class='star'><span class='star1919'>&star;</span></a> Jocelyn Ornelas-Munoz  <span id='bitlink-3155'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3155)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3155' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3155)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Negative Binomial Optimization for Novel Structural Variant Detection</b><br />Jocelyn Ornelas-Munoz<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(741)' class='star'><span class='star741'>&star;</span></a> Sigrun Ortleb  <span id='bitlink-3156'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3156)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3156' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3156)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Stability of IMEX Schemes for Convection-Diffusion Equations Discretized by Upwind SBP Schemes</b><br />Sigrun Ortleb<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-162.html'>Constructing and Exploiting Discretizations with the Summation-by-Parts Property - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>In the context of convection-diffusion equations, IMEX approaches generally discretize the convection terms explicitly and treat the diffusion terms implicitly in order to avoid parabolic time step restrictions based on the stiff diffusion terms. Recent research has shown that specific combinations of space and time discretization even yield unconditional stability of the resulting scheme with grid-independent time step restrictions only based on the convection and diffusion constants.  For DG space discretizations using upwind numerical fluxes, previous analysis via energy estimates has shown that the choice of diffusion fluxes influences this stabilization mechanism. For instance, whereas LDG fluxes allow for grid-independent time step sizes when IMEX time stepping is applied, the classical BR1 fluxes do not.  In this talk, we focus on the spatial discretization by upwind SBP schemes which introduce an upwind mechanism similar to numerical fluxes within the DG method. Using energy equations, we investigate the stability of upwind-SBP-discretized convection-diffusion problems using IMEX time stepping. This analysis is quite general and only requires a compatibility of the first and second derivative SBP operators. In particular, the upwind SBP framework allows to show that replacing upwind advection fluxes by central fluxes in fact suffices to guarantee grid-independent time step restrictions in case of BR1 diffusion fluxes.

To capture this dynamic interplay, fully implicit methods, also known as monolithic approaches, are usually preferred. However, this requires solution of large linear systems that result from the discretization and linearization of the governing balance equations. Such systems are non-symmetric, indefinite, and highly ill-conditioned, which make them difficult to solve. These problems become even more challenging when the flow is coupled to mechanical processes such as rock fracture and deformation. Thus, designing preconditioners that can handle the couplings between different physics is critical for fast convergence. Furthermore, the emergence of new HPC hardware with accelerators, such as GPUs, provide opportunities to further improve the performance of the solution process, when adequately exploited. This work will present our efforts to develop scalable linear solver strategies for subsurface flow applications, designed to be efficient on modern HPC systems. We present a framework based on multigrid reduction (MGR) that is suited for tightly coupled systems of PDEs and demonstrate its applicability to handle challenging problems from multiphase flow applications. We show that the framework is flexible to accommodate a wide range of scenarios, as well as efficient and scalable for large problems on state-of-the-art HPC architectures.

Complicated models, for which a detailed analysis is too far out of reach, are routinely approximated via a variety of procedures; this is the case when we use multiscale methods, when we take many particle limits and obtained a simplified, coarse-grained dynamics, or, simply, when we use numerical methods. While approximating,  we make an error which is small over small time-intervals but it typically compounds over longer time-horizons. Hence, in general, the approximation error grows in time so that the results of our &#8220;predictions" are less reliable when we look at longer time-horizons.   However this is not necessarily the case and one may be able to find dynamics and corresponding approximation procedures for which the error remains bounded, uniformly in time.  We will discuss a very general approach to understand when this is possible.  I will show how the approach we take is very broad and show how it can be used for all of the approximation procedures mentioned above – with a particular focus on numerical approximations for SDEs. This is based on a series of joint works with L. Angeli, D. Crisan, P. Dobson, I. Souttar.

In general, such reduced systems are achieved by projecting the high fidelity equations onto a reduced subspace obtained by the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. With varying parameters, such projected models may experience instabilities even if the original system is asymptotically stable. Moreover, the data may originate from experience making hard the application of Galerkin projection. To overcome these issues, we propose a data-driven approach to construct parametric reduced order models (DD/PROM). Regardless of the origin of the data, the DD/PROM is achieved by learning the model through residual assimilation. Then, interpolation on the  tangent space of the Grassmann manifold is used to handle parameter variations. We show on the example of the flow past a cylinder, that the PROM/DD succeeds to reproduce the dynamics with a good accuracy, for a wide range of Reynolds number values.

The loss function identifies desirable parameter values for given responses. The advantage of Gibbs inference over traditional Bayesian inference is that it does not require the specification of a probabilistic data-generating process and, therefore, should be less sensitive to this process. This talk proposes Gibbs optimal design of experiments for this inferential framework, extended decision-theoretic Bayesian optimal design. The challenge is that the decision-theoretic approach relies on a probabilistic data-generating process that is notably absent from Gibbs inference. This is circumvented by assuming a designer model: a probabilistic data-generating process which is only used to find a design rather than in the ensuing inference. Because of this, the designer model can encapsulate very general data-generating processes with the aim of introducing robustness into the design procedure. The proposed Gibbs optimal design framework is demonstrated on several illustrative examples.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75414' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1421)' class='star'><span class='star1421'>&star;</span></a> Nate Overton-Katz  <span id='bitlink-3163'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3163)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3163' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3163)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Higher-Order Finite-Volume Embedded Boundary Methods on Moving Domains</b><br />Nate Overton-Katz<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-313.html'>Recent Advances in Cut Cell Discretizations: Accuracy, Stability, and Applications - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>This works presents a high-order finite-volume embedded boundary method capable of representing moving boundaries. The algorithm automates mesh generation around complex geometries by embedding them in a Cartesian grid with cut-cells on the boundaries, and is capable of providing high-order geometric information as necessary. In space, the scheme achieves fourth-order accurate discretizations that are stable in the presence of small cut-cells. We devise weighted least-squares reconstructions to achieve this without approaches such as mesh modification, cell merging, or redistribution. In time, we employ a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme which treats viscous and diffusive terms implicitly, while treating the advection and boundary motion terms explicitly.    
We apply this algorithm to modeling the formation of small bubbles of liquid water produced on catalyst sites inside hydrogen fuel-cells. Modeling this system requires coupled multi-phase physics with reactant gasses governed by advection-diffusion equations, produced liquid water governed by the unsteady Stokes equations, and chemical reactions occurring on solid boundaries.

It is one of the two CFD codes of the Unified European Applications Benchmark Suite (UEBAS). On its path to Exascale, it has needed significant changes to adapt to new architectures, such as GPUs. This work describes recent improvements focused on large-scale incompressible flow problems. The momentum equation is treated explicitly while the pressure is solved implicitly. A fractional step scheme is used to enable elements that do not satisfy the inf-sup condition. The Laplacian matrix for the pressure remains fixed during the simulation for typical cases with a fixed mesh. Therefore, the two main kernels are calculating the right-hand side term for the momentum equation and the solution of a linear system for the pressure. This work focuses on the first step, but some minor comments on the linear solver will also be presented.   Compared to our previous GPU implementation,  more than an order of magnitude reduction in computational time for the assembly has been obtained. OpenACC has allowed us to be close to 50% of the maximum floating-point performance on an A100 Nvidia GPU. While optimizing the GPU version, improvements to the CPU implementation have also been obtained. Comparing the current CPU and GPU energy consumption shows good agreement with the ratios one can expect from the Top500 or Green500 lists.

One such complex system is the active nematic liquid crystal system consisting of microtubule-motor protein assemblies immersed in a fluid. This system exhibits rich non-equilibrium behavior, including spontaneous creation and annihilation of topological defects. Although several models have been proposed for the system, the governing equations remain under debate.    
We here present a model extracted directly from experimental image data via the "sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics" (SINDy) data-driven modeling technique. This model discovery process includes extracting appropriate data for a continuum model from experimental data, constructing a plausible library of model terms, and solving a sparse regression problem. A number of issues arise in this process, including strong correlations between library terms and instabilities in the discovered models. We present numerical simulations and the results of some modern statistical and classical pen-and-paper analyses which combine to clarify the discovery results. We then discuss the physical implications of the learned model, and compare the model with those proposed previously.

However, the long-time evolution of hydrodynamically interacting collectives is challenging to investigate due to the persistent influence of long-lived vortical structures, and the high-resolution requirements of direct numerical simulation at large Reynolds numbers.   Reduced-order models have therefore played an important role in theoretical investigations.  We introduce a new reduced-order model of swimmers that self-propel by flapping, i.e., executing a prescribed periodic rigid body motion. The model is an extension of a discrete-time dynamical system developed by Oza, Ristroph and Shelley in which flapping swimmers interact through periodically shed vortices.  Our work allows a variable separation distance between swimmers and also describes more faithfully the wing-wing interactions of our dynamical system.  The model is used to investigate conditions under which hydrodynamic interactions lead to stable swimming configurations. Preliminary numerical results are presented.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75517' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1717)' class='star'><span class='star1717'>&star;</span></a> Aleksandra Pachalieva  <span id='bitlink-3168'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3168)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3168' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3168)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Heterogeneous Underground Reservoir Pressure Management</b><br />Aleksandra Pachalieva<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-379.html'>High-Fidelity and Data-Driven Methods for Multiscale and Multi-Physics Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Avoiding over-pressurization in subsurface reservoirs is critical for applications like CO2 sequestration and wastewater injection. Managing the pressures by controlling injection/extraction is challenging because of complex heterogeneity in the subsurface. The heterogeneity typically requires high-fidelity physics-based models to make predictions on CO2 fate. Furthermore, characterizing the heterogeneity accurately is fraught with parametric uncertainty. Accounting for heterogeneity and uncertainty makes this a computationally-intensive problem challenging for current reservoir simulators. To tackle this, we use differentiable programming with a full-physics model and machine learning to determine the fluid extraction rates that prevent over-pressurization at critical reservoir locations. We use DPFEHM framework, which has trustworthy physics based on the standard two-point flux finite volume discretization and is also automatically differentiable like machine learning models. Our physics-informed machine learning framework uses convolutional neural networks to learn an appropriate extraction rate based on the permeability field. We also perform a hyperparameter search to improve the model’s accuracy. We constructed and tested a sufficiently accurate simulator that is 400 000 times faster than the underlying physics-based simulator, allowing for near real-time analysis and robust uncertainty quantification.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75833' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1055)' class='star'><span class='star1055'>&star;</span></a> Ludger Paehler  <span id='bitlink-3169'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3169)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3169' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3169)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Automated Acceleration of Differentiable Computational Fluid Dynamics for Bayesian Optimization</b><br />Ludger Paehler<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-231.html'>Accelerating Computational Science and Engineering via Data-Driven Learning and Nonlinear Model Reduction - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>With the ever more prevalent use of differentiable programming techniques throughout simulations, and machine learning, the desire to extend these techniques to classical fluid dynamics simulations for outer-loop applications such as Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification, and Bayesian Optimization has also become ever more pressing. While current approaches in fluid dynamics still view simulation as a black box which is then integrated with an outer-loop optimization framework, and potentially utilizes Gaussian Process surrogates to accelerate the sampling, modern differentiable programming approaches promise to heavily accelerate the optimization process through the acceleration of simulations, and the access to gradients of simulation trajectories.    
In this talk we build on recent advances in compiler-based automatic differentiation of parallelized C/C++, and  Fortran-based computational fluid dynamics simulators to for the first time accelerate the production-level simulations with machine learning techniques in an intrusive fashion to enable Bayesian optimization, where it was previously infeasible to apply Bayesian optimization to.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75553' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2019)' class='star'><span class='star2019'>&star;</span></a> Ludger Paehler  <span id='bitlink-3170'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3170)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3170' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3170)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Integrating Scientific Simulations with Machine Learning Algorithms</b><br />Ludger Paehler<br />Friday, March 3 9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-421.html'>Integrating Scientific Simulations with Machine Learning Algorithms - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77172' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2022)' class='star'><span class='star2022'>&star;</span></a> Ludger Paehler  <span id='bitlink-3171'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3171)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3171' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3171)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Integrating Scientific Simulations with Machine Learning Algorithms</b><br />Ludger Paehler<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-422.html'>Integrating Scientific Simulations with Machine Learning Algorithms - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77173' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(666)' class='star'><span class='star666'>&star;</span></a> Stefano Pagani  <span id='bitlink-3172'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3172)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3172' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3172)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Scientific Machine Learning Models in Cardiac Electrophysiology</b><br />Stefano Pagani<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-147.html'>Scientific Machine Learning and Data-Driven Techniques in Complex Multi-Physics Systems  - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Cutting-edge machine- and deep-learning technologies for processing and analyzing clinical data enable new approaches to personalized diagnosis and treatment based on individual patient characteristics. These approaches require large volumes of high-resolution data for training the models, which are not always available: measurements may be incomplete, affected by noise, or give a partial reconstruction of the phenomenon.     
In this talk, we present physics-aware and physics-informed learning approaches that leverage clinical data with the physical knowledge of underlying phenomena. Specifically, we adopt dimensionality reduction techniques built from simulation snapshots in physics-aware artificial neural networks to improve prediction accuracy and training efficiency. We also consider additional physics-informed constraints to data-driven loss functions. These terms directly penalize the residual of partial differential equations or boundary/initial conditions. In this way, we simultaneously counterbalance incomplete data with physical knowledge and improve the performance of low-complexity architectures based on a limited number of hyperparameters.    
We finally show some numerical results of physics-aware and physics-informed neural networks with applications to cardiac electrophysiology.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75442' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1685)' class='star'><span class='star1685'>&star;</span></a> Tomas Pajdla  <span id='bitlink-3173'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3173)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3173' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3173)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reconstructing the Geometry of Cameras in the Age of Machine Learning</b><br />Tomas Pajdla<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-373.html'>Problems and Solutions in 3-D Reconstruction - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75819' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1228)' class='star'><span class='star1228'>&star;</span></a> Victor A.

Compression techniques that eliminate redundancy and bits of marginal accuracy in floating-point arrays are commonly employed in many scientific applications to deal with this bottleneck. However, the variety of post-processing analyses performed by domain scientists causes regular compression workflows to be conservative and achieve low reduction ratios. In this context, progressive data compression and retrieval arise as a solution for achieving higher overall ratios.  Moreover, it allows for the adaptive handling of compressed data according to the needs of a given post-processing task. Currently, a few algorithms natively support progressive data processing. In this work, we present a general framework for adding progressiveness in terms of precision to scientific data compressors. Our framework is based on a multiple-component representation where each new component reduces the error between the original and compressed fields. We have implemented it on top of the ZFP, SZ, MGARD, and SPERR compressors, and, in this presentation, we discuss results obtained with several data fields from the SDRBENCH collection. Numerical results show that our approach is effective in terms of accuracy compared to each of the standalone compressors it builds upon.

As such MPC usually relies on model of underlying dynamics. However, there is rapidly growing line of research which replaces the model with data-driven system descriptions. Of particular interest are methods which can work with output-data only. So far most of the research on data-driven predictive control has focused on noisy measurement data but not on the consideration of stochastic disturbances. In this talk, we discuss data-driven predictive control with stochastic uncertainties. We show how a tailored variant of the ubiquitous fundamental lemma in combination with polynomial chaos expansions enables data-driven output-feedback stochastic predictive control. We present sufficient stability conditions and we draw upon numerical examples to illustrate our findings.

Among various types of UQ methods, the Monte Carlo (MC) method played an important role due to its simplicity and robustness. However, the large computational cost of the MC is often the main obstacle to applying MC to an engineering application. In this presentation, a new framework will be introduced which improves the efficiency of the standard UQ via the MC method. This framework employs the uncertainty intrinsic code (UIC) which extends the uncertain variables via a stochastic dimension holding their uncertainty information. With the help of UIC, the redundant operator can be eliminated and the data density can be improved simultaneously so that the execution efficiency in a high-performance computing system can be improved. According to the Numerical experiments, the new framework achieved a moderate improvement in sequential code and up to 85% efficiency improvement for the parallel code.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75888' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2065)' class='star'><span class='star2065'>&star;</span></a> Piyush Panchal  <span id='bitlink-3177'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3177)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3177' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3177)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Electrostatic Force Computation using the Boundary Element Method</b><br />Piyush Panchal<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-428.html'>Computational Engineering (BGCE) Student Paper Prize - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D302<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75494' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(281)' class='star'><span class='star281'>&star;</span></a> Jong-Shi Pang  <span id='bitlink-3178'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3178)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3178' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3178)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Surrogation Methods for Nonconvex Nondifferential Problems in Finite Dimensions</b><br />Jong-Shi Pang<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-62.html'>Algorithms for Nonsmooth, Nonconvex Optimization - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Optimization problems with coupled nonconvexity and nondifferentiability are particularly challenging to solve.

Many methods require a truncation of the domain to discretize. Aside from the expense, the nonlocal nature of FPDEs and the slow decay of the solutions often cause numerical artefacts to appear even with large truncations. Moreover, the solutions may exhibit singularities that must be accounted for to build methods that converge quickly.     
We discuss a class of FPDEs that include sqrt-Laplacian, derivative, Hilbert transform and identity operators. By constructing a sum space consisting of weighted Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and their Hilbert transform counterparts, we precisely identify the action of the fractional operator on our approximation space. This allows us to derive sparse relationships between the sum space that we expand our solution in, and the right-hand side which is expanded in the so-called dual sum space. Affine transformations of the sum space can be combined to together in the approximation where, remarkably, the action of the fractional operator decouples. Hence, we solve over each interval separately and in parallel.     
We apply our spectral method to problems with smooth data, where we observe spectral convergence, as well as a fractional wave propagation problem.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75527' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1422)' class='star'><span class='star1422'>&star;</span></a> Panayiotis Papadopoulos  <span id='bitlink-3181'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3181)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3181' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3181)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Robust Cut-Cell Finite Elements in Two and Three Dimensions</b><br />Panayiotis Papadopoulos<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-313.html'>Recent Advances in Cut Cell Discretizations: Accuracy, Stability, and Applications - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>This presentation concerns a geometrically simple and computationally robust cut-cell finite element method for Poisson's equation on arbitrarily shaped two- and three-dimensional domains. The equation is solved on a Cartesian axis-aligned grid of 4-node square elements in two dimensions and 8-node cube elements. These intersect the boundary of the domain in a smooth but arbitrary manner. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed strongly by means of a projection method, while Neumann boundary conditions require integration over a locally discretized boundary region. Representative numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is stable and attains the asymptotic convergence rates expected of the corresponding unstructured body-fitted finite element method. Limited proofs of stability (in the sense of the inf-sup condition) are also available and will be discussed.

Such instabilities are typically  long wave and were discovered about 50 years ago by Yih. The rule of thumb is that in simple shear flows  instability arises if the more viscous layer is also the thinner one, the so-called thin layer effect.  Motivated by experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we consider fluid systems that allow for  slip at fluid-fluid interfaces (slip at fluid-solid surfaces is orders of magnitude smaller and is ignored).  The basic states are viscous but support a velocity jump across interfaces. We have a viscous analogue of the  Kelvin-Helmholtz problem seen in inviscid flows, and the natural question is to analyse such slip models to  gain an understanding of their well-posedness and map out their stability characteristics. I will address  two aspects: (i) A linear theory of the general problem and a semi-analytical demonstration of short-wave instabilities   when the slip is asymptotically large; (ii) the development of a thin-layer long-wave nonlinear model and a discussion  of its stability characteristics. It will be shown that for viscosity ratios that render the no-slip flow stable, even a small  amount of slip can cause short wave instabilities of the Turing type. Nonlinear computations will be reported.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(688)' class='star'><span class='star688'>&star;</span></a> Taejun Park  <span id='bitlink-3183'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3183)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3183' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3183)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Fast Randomized Algorithm for Computing the Null Space</b><br />Taejun Park<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-151.html'>Randomized Numerical Algorithms for Matrix and Tensor Analysis - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we examine the effect of sketching on the right singular vectors corresponding to the smallest singular values of a tall-skinny matrix.

Recently, we showed that the stresses computed from the finite element solution are also robust and locking-free thanks to the uniform (in mesh size and polynomial degree) inf-sup stability of the Scott-Vogelius elements. Unfortunately, the condition number of the resulting linear system blows up in the incompressible limit, as the mesh is refined, and/or as the polynomial degree is increased. We present a family of preconditioners that control the growth of the condition number uniformly in the Lamé parameters, the mesh size, and the polynomial degree. The preconditioners are illustrated by applying them to the solution of a number of representative test problems. As a by-product of the analysis, we also obtain a preconditioner for the Morgan-Scott $C^1$-conforming finite element space that is uniform in the mesh size and polynomial degree.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75646' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(929)' class='star'><span class='star929'>&star;</span></a> Pietro Parodi  <span id='bitlink-3185'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3185)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3185' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3185)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Analysis of Implicit PIC Schemes and Their Application to Electric Propulsion</b><br />Pietro Parodi<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-203.html'>Multiscale Methods for Kinetic Models: Theory and Numerics - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Simulation of plasmas for space electric propulsion is a complex task because of two reasons: first, the size of interest of the system is usually comparable to the collisional length scale. As a result, velocity distributions are often in nonequilibrium. Using the hybrid Particle-in-Cell - Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (PIC-DSMC) method allows to overcome this problem, since phase space can be efficiently represented using computational particles. Secondly, the length- and time scales of interest are often much larger than the smallest natural scales of the plasma, which are dictated by electrons. Traditional explicit PIC schemes need to resolve these small scales, otherwise disrupting numerical instabilities appear. These requirements can make simulation of an entire physical device extremely expensive, and practically unfeasible above a certain plasma density. Recently, a new class of implicit and semi-implicit methods have been devised, mostly for applications in astrophysics. These feature exact total energy conservation and are stable for cell sizes and time steps well in excess of the Debye length and plasma frequency, allowing the simulation of higher density plasmas in larger domains. We present our finite element implementation of the electrostatic version of these schemes, and analyze their properties through simple numerical experiments. Finally, we investigate how these methods can be applied to the simulation of electric propulsion and laboratory plasmas.

To guide policy decisions on climate change adaptation and mitigation, there is a need for developing new types of climate information systems that can provide timely information on regional and local impacts of climate change. The European Commission’s Destination Earth (DestinE) programme aims towards this by developing high precision digital twins (DT) of the Earth. In this presentation we will focus on one of the two first priority DTs, the Climate Change Adaptation DT. The climate DT system will be developed around two of Europe’s leading ESMs, ICON and IFS-FESOM/NEMO. These models, which are the nucleus of the Horizon 2020 NextGEMS (Next Generation Earth Modeling Systems) project, are the only global models within Europe with a demonstrated ability to run coupled to an ocean at scales finer than 5 km globally. They have been benchmarked on the largest computing systems presently available within Europe, and will be adapted to two of Europe’s largest computing infrastructures coming online in the next months: MareNostrum 5 at the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre, and LUMI operated by the CSC–IT Center for Science. We will describe the first stage of this adaptation and will present future plans for running these global simulations efficiently at kilometer scales.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75468' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(599)' class='star'><span class='star599'>&star;</span></a> Matteo Parsani  <span id='bitlink-3187'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3187)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3187' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3187)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On the Robustness of Time Integration Schemes Coupled with Adaptive High-Order Spatial Discretizations with the Sbp Property</b><br />Matteo Parsani<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-131.html'>Discretization Methods with Provable Properties for the Robust Simulation of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>We report the performance of explicitly Runge--Kutta schemes that are equipped with time step adaptivity and possibly coupled with the relaxation procedure to achieve entropy stability for computational fluid dynamics.

Three emerging challenges on obtaining relevant solutions to large-scale and data-intensive inverse problems are ill-posedness of the problem, large dimensionality of the parameters, and the complexity of the model constraints. In this talk we discuss efficient methods for computing solutions to dynamic inverse problems, where both the quantities of interest and the forward operator may change at different time instances. We consider large-scale ill-posed problems that are made more challenging by their dynamic nature and, possibly, by the limited amount of available data per measurement step.  In the first part of the talk, to remedy these difficulties, we apply efficient regularization methods that enforce simultaneous regularization in space and time (such as edge enhancement at each time instant and proximity at consecutive time instants) and achieve this with low computational cost and enhanced accuracy.  In the remainder of the talk, we focus on designing spatio-temporal Bayesian Besov priors for computing the MAP estimate and quantifying uncertainties in large-scale and dynamic inverse problems.  Numerical examples from a wide range of applications, such as tomographic reconstruction, image deblurring, and multichannel dynamic tomography are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the described approaches.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75570' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(955)' class='star'><span class='star955'>&star;</span></a> Mathis J.

Moreover, exploration and accuracy in the UQ space are all the more difficult to reach when more than 2 uncertain variables and functional outputs are considered, as is the case for instance when constructing atmospheric pollution maps. Traditionally, such UQ analyses are carried out using proper orthogonal decomposition with gaussian processes to emulate the coefficients of a truncated Karhunen-Loeve decomposition (POD-GP). This method is used in this work to carry out a global sensitivity analysis for a realistic high-dimensional traffic-related atmospheric pollutant dispersion CFD study with up to 5 uncertain variables. The pollutant dipsersion is modelled with the open-source OpenLB lattice-Boltzmann CFD code, coupled with the SUMO microscale traffic simulator and a physical engine emissions model. We also compare the POD-GP method with another metamodeling strategy based on an anchored-ANOVA decomposition of the quantity of interest, which was designed to reduce the number of required samples in the UQ space for a given accuracy.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75519' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1299)' class='star'><span class='star1299'>&star;</span></a> Nisha Patel  <span id='bitlink-3190'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3190)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3190' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3190)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Intel Developer Tools for Serious SYCL</b><br />Nisha Patel<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-286.html'>SYCL's Impact on Algorithms, Data Structures and Implementations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Intel with it's oneAPI developer suite brings in compatibility and ease of use on the table.

Thereby, the approximation efficiency is dramatically improved as one avoids the wasting of degrees of freedom by increasing the number of basis functions only where rapid and large variations occur in the analyzed object. Nevertheless, the adoption of LR B-splines for simulation purposes, in the Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) framework, is hindered by the risk of linear dependence relations. Although a complete characterization of linear independence is still not available, the local linear independence of the basis functions is guaranteed when the underlying Locally Refined (LR) mesh has the so-called Non-Nested-Support property.    
The local linear independence not only avoids the hurdles of dealing with singular linear systems, but it also improves the sparsity of the matrices when assembling the numerical solution. Such a strong property of the basis functions is a rarity, or at least it is quite onerous to gain, among the technologies used for adaptive IgA. Only thee refinement strategies have been proposed to build LR meshes with the Non-Nested-Support property so far: the Non-Nested-Support-Structured mesh refinement, the Effective Grading refinement and the Hierarchically Locally Refined mesh refinement. In this talk, we shall have an overview of them, highlighting and comparing their properties.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75663' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(852)' class='star'><span class='star852'>&star;</span></a> Will Pazner  <span id='bitlink-3195'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3195)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3195' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3195)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Matrix-Free Low-Order-Refined Preconditioners for High-Order H(curl) and H(div) Problems with GPU Acceleration</b><br />Will Pazner<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-186.html'>Matrix-Free Solvers for Large-Scale Applications</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>While efficient algorithms are well-known for the application of high-order finite element operators, the development of effective solvers and preconditioners for the resulting large-scale linear systems remains a more challenging problem. One key challenge is that the associated matrices are generally too dense to compute and store, necessitating the development of matrix-free preconditioners.    
In this talk, I will describe the construction of a class of low-order-refined preconditioners for problems posed in all spaces of the high-order finite element de Rham complex. This construction is facilitated by the use of an interpolation-histopolation basis that guarantees spectral equivalence of the high-order and low-order-refined operators, independent of the mesh size $h$ and polynomial degree $p$. Specialized algebraic multigrid methods can then be used to obtain scalable, high-performance, GPU-accelerated, matrix-free solvers for the high-order problems.    
Additionally, I will describe the development of new matrix-free solvers for grad-div problems and mixed finite element problems in $\boldsymbol{H}(\operatorname{div})$. These solvers are based on solving the saddle-point system, and also use properties of the interpolation-histopolation basis to achieve enhanced sparsity.

These problems involve minimizing some function arising from a physical objective, while obeying a system of PDEs which describe the process. Of key interest is the numerical solution of the discretized linear systems arising from such problems, and in this talk we focus on preconditioned iterative methods for these systems.     
In particular, we describe recent advances in the preconditioning of multiple saddle-point systems, specifically positive definite preconditioners which can be applied within MINRES, which may find considerable utility for solving these optimization problems as well as other applications. In particular, these preconditioners lead to a guaranteed convergence rate for MINRES, and often demonstrate superior convergence as opposed to widely-used block diagonal preconditioners.     
Further, we briefly discuss an inexact active-set method for large-scale nonlinear PDE-constrained optimization problems, coupled with block diagonal and block triangular preconditioners for multiple saddle-point systems which utilize suitable approximations for the relevant Schur complements.

The growing applications of butterfly matrices have often eclipsed the mathematical understanding of how or why butterfly matrices are able to accomplish these given tasks. To help begin to close this gap using theoretical and numerical approaches, we explore the impact on the growth factor of preconditioning a linear system by butterfly matrices. These results are compared to other common methods found in randomized numerical linear algebra. In these experiments, we show preconditioning using butterfly matrices has a more significant dampening impact on large growth factors than other common preconditioners and a smaller increase to minimal growth factor systems. Moreover, we are able to determine the full distribution of the growth factors for a subclass of random butterfly matrices. Previous results by Trefethen and Schreiber relating to the distribution of random growth factors were limited to empirical estimates of the first moment for Ginibre matrices.

They are commonly used as high-level building blocks for data processing pipelines; however, they typically lack extended settings of underlying optimization solvers or monitor convergence. Currently used machine learning applications perform parallelism on a task level or orchestration based on multiple container instances of an application running in Kubernetes or Microsoft Azure.  In our contribution, we will present a software solution for distributed machine learning supporting computation on multiple GPUs running on the top of the PETSc framework (https://petsc.org/), which we will demonstrate in applications related to natural hazard localizations and detections employing supervised uncertainties modelling. It is called PERMON (http://permon.vsb.cz) and is designed for convex optimization using quadratic programming, and its extension PermonSVM implements maximal-margin classifier approaches associated with support vector machines (SVMs). Although deep learning (DL) is getting popular in recent years, SVMs are still applicable. Unlike DL, an underlying optimization problem associated with SVM is convex, and PermonSVM computes it in a deterministic way (no batch processing) through no intrinsic limitations imposed by a single node memory, convergence to a global minimum is guaranteed. Moreover, an attained model can be easily explainable.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75758' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(503)' class='star'><span class='star503'>&star;</span></a> Benjamin Peherstorfer  <span id='bitlink-3199'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3199)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3199' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3199)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Neural Galerkin Schemes for Evolution Equations</b><br />Benjamin Peherstorfer<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-111.html'>Advances in Latent Representation Learning for Scientific Applications - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>Neural Galerkin schemes build on Dirac-Frenkel variational methods to propagate forward in time nonlinear, low-dimensional parametrizations for efficiently predicting nonlinear latent dynamics of transport-dominated problems.

Furthermore, using the fact that information is transported with finite velocity in many cases, the dimension of the agents' environment can be drastically reduced using a convolution operation over the state space of the PDE. In this setting, the complexity can be flexibly adjusted via the kernel width or using a stride greater than one. A central question in this framework is the definition of the reward function, which may consist of both local and global contributions. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework using several standard PDE examples with increasing complexity, where stabilization is achieved by training a low-dimensional DDPG agent with small training effort.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75573' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(500)' class='star'><span class='star500'>&star;</span></a> Slaven Peles  <span id='bitlink-3201'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3201)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3201' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3201)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Fine-Grain Parallel Solution Strategies for Extremely Ill-Conditioned Linear Systems</b><br />Slaven Peles<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-110.html'>Parallel Linear Solvers for Ill-Conditioned Engineering Design Problems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Design computations for complex engineering systems typically generate extremely sparse and ill-conditioned linear systems. Their nature makes it challenging to solve them efficiently in a fine-grain parallel fashion. Iterative linear solvers, which can be parallelized effectively, are not performing well on such ill-conditioned problems. Traditional supernodal and multifrontal parallel strategies used in direct linear solvers are not effective with extremely sparse systems, because dense blocks created by these methods are too small to take advantage of fast dense linear algebra. These challenges impede deployment of design computations to heterogeneous compute platforms, which use hardware accelerators such as GPUs.    
We propose linear solver strategy tailored to fine-grain parallel design computations. We take advantage of design computations creating a sequence of linear systems with the same sparsity pattern to perform first factorization on the host and then move sparse factors to the hardware accelerator. Each subsequent linear solve is reusing the same ordering and symbolic factorization and performs numerical (re)factorization using a partial pivoting method. This strategy requires advanced iterative refinement to recover solution of required quality. We present our results and show performance improvement over current state of the art. We discuss future research directions to develop robust sparse linear solvers that perform well on hardware accelerators.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75385' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1400)' class='star'><span class='star1400'>&star;</span></a> Fran&#231;ois Pellegrini  <span id='bitlink-3202'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3202)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3202' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3202)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Design and Implementation of Multi-Threaded and Hybrid Parallel Graph Partitioning Algorithms in Scotch v7</b><br />Fran&#231;ois Pellegrini<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-308.html'>Recent Advances in Combinatorial Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>Graph partitioning is a ubiquitous problem which has many applications in scientific computing. Due to the ever increasing size of the problems to solve, many parallel implementations of graph partitioning algorithms have been proposed in the literature, whether for shared-memory multiprocessors or distributed-memory multicomputers.    
This paper describes the design and implementation of multi-threaded algorithms in version 7 of the Scotch partitioning package. These algorithms concern both the formerly sequential version, Scotch, and the parallel, distributed-memory version, PT-Scotch. Notably, a hybrid parallel (MPI+threads) graph coarsening algorithm is proposed, which is used to accelerate the classic multilevel partitioning framework. In order to provide scientific reproducibility, deterministic algorithms have been implemented whenever possible, and can be selected at the user's choice. Concurrent execution is made possible by the encapsulation of partitioning tasks within execution contexts.    
While a global linear speedup is out of reach due to the many remaining non-parallel sections, the multi-threaded algorithms evidence high scalability themselves, and provide for a significant improvement in run time, without any loss in partition quality.

Although the underlying physics are usually well understood, adequately modelling these systems with constructive or physically motivated approaches is challenging in practice because e.g. material properties or domain geometries cannot be known at the required level of fidelity. Additionally, the model has to encompass the frequency span of human hearing - about three orders of magnitude. Hence, measurements have proven to be indispensable when dealing with real-world acoustical systems which makes high dimensional measurement data abundantly available.    
Classical realization methods, such as the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm, rely on the computation of orthogonal decompositions like SVD which is prohibitively expensive for the data at hand. As a remedy, these realization methods can be endowed with recent methods from randomized linear algebra for efficiently approximating orthogonal decompositions of large matrices. In this way, it is possible to construct accurate reduced order models from high dimensional data efficiently. In turn, this sheds new light onto many acoustical modelling challenges.    
The aim of this talk is to showcase and validate several contemporary extensions and augmentations to established realization methods and analyze their aptitude and performance in practical applications that involve high dimensional measurements of real systems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75369' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2010)' class='star'><span class='star2010'>&star;</span></a> Art Pelling  <span id='bitlink-3205'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3205)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3205' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3205)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>pyMOR - Model Order Reduction with Python</b><br />Art Pelling<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-416.html'>pyMOR - Model Order Reduction with Python - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77166' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(310)' class='star'><span class='star310'>&star;</span></a> Qiyao Peng  <span id='bitlink-3206'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3206)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3206' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3206)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Applying Machine Learning to Enhance the Computational Efficiency in Agent-Based Wound Healing Model</b><br />Qiyao Peng<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-68.html'>Data-Driven Methods in Computational Biomechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Deep tissue injuries often go with a contraction of the skin. This contraction can become contracture if it causes a loss of mobility of the joint of the patient. Contracture results from the cellular traction forces exerted by the (myo)fibroblasts during the proliferation phase. In Peng and Vermolen (2020), an agent-based model is developed to mimic the wound healing, in which every cell is treated individually as a fixed circle in two dimensions. To model the cellular forces exerted by the (myo)fibroblasts, the cell membrane is first broken into line segments. Then, the point forces are applied at the midpoint of each line segment using the Dirac Delta distribution and then solving the elasticity equation with finite-element methods; this is the most computationally expensive part of the entire model. Since our final goal is to predict the likelihood that such a contracture occurs and to analyze the impact of several treatments on preventing a serious contraction, the model has to be evaluated many times and a computationally efficient model is required. Moreover, while myofibroblasts are known as a dendritic shape with lamellipodium developed from the cell membrane, a large number of line segments would be needed to model such cell membrane shapes. In the talk, the benefits of the machine learning-enhanced model with respect to the variation of the cell shape and the resulting improvements in the computational efficiency are discussed based on numerical results.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75313' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1411)' class='star'><span class='star1411'>&star;</span></a> Zhen Peng  <span id='bitlink-3207'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3207)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3207' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3207)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quantum Machine Learning for Engineering Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</b><br />Zhen Peng<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-311.html'>AI-Driven Design and Optimization of Future Electronics - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75699' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1130)' class='star'><span class='star1130'>&star;</span></a> Kamran Pentland  <span id='bitlink-3208'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3208)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3208' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3208)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>GParareal: (Towards) a Probabilistic Time-Parallel ODE Solver</b><br />Kamran Pentland<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-248.html'>Parallel-in-Time Algorithms: Performance and Real-World Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Parareal is a well-studied (deterministic) time-parallel algorithm designed to integrate initial value problems (IVPs) by combining solutions from cheap (coarse) and expensive (fine) numerical integrators using a predictor-corrector (PC).

For this purpose, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a powerful tool used in various fields under different names, is often utilized. The main characteristic of the method, as used in fluid dynamics, is to decompose an original data set into a set of basis functions dependent on space and coefficients dependent on time. Given that SVD provides an optimal representation of the original data set, it is often used for data analysis and compression, since low energetic modes can be discarded while keeping a reasonable reconstruction of the original fields. The present work takes advantage of the temporally dynamic and spatially partitioned nature of the domains in turbulence simulations by calculating local SVDs in different regions of the flow field. This approach exploits the locality of the flow features which allows SVD to find a sparser basis to describe the flow and, in turn, increase compression. Apart from the inherently parallel nature of the approach, we calculate the local SVDs in a streaming manner such that, in general, the original data does not need to be stored but can be analyzed at simulation runtime. Thus, our approach provides a way to compress data with local SVDs, obtain global POD modes, and a simple way to calculate DMD, another modal decomposition used for understanding flow dynamics.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75848' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1761)' class='star'><span class='star1761'>&star;</span></a> Carlos Perez-Arancibia  <span id='bitlink-3211'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3211)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3211' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3211)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Density Interpolation Methods for Volume Potentials</b><br />Carlos Perez-Arancibia<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-387.html'>Recent Advances on Integral Equation and Spectral Methods for Inhomogeneous Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>We present a simple numerical method for the high-order numerical evaluation of volume integral operators associated with the Poisson and Helmholtz equations in two spatial dimensions.

The layer potentials can be accurately and efficiently evaluated everywhere by means of existing methods (e.g. the density interpolation method), while the regularized volume integral can be accurately evaluated by applying elementary quadrature rules.

With the universal approximation theorem and fast evaluations, neural networks (NN) are promising. However, by the curse of dimensionality, with many input variables, NNs become too data greedy for practical usage. For many problems in engineering, there exist data and/or models with multiple fidelity levels. This multifidelity knowledge can be exploited to make data-efficient models that are accurate enough for inverse design. I will present a recently developed physics-enhanced deep surrogate (PEDS) that combines a NN generator, trained end-to-end with a low-fidelity PDE solver, to match costly high-fidelity data. PEDS saves at least two orders of magnitude in data needed to inverse design. The solver is inaccurate but fast and enforces inductive biases that make PEDS designs always satisfy the PDE knowledge. When only multifidelity data is available, the low-fidelity solver can be replaced by a learned operator on the low-fidelity dataset. To finish, we will present inverse design results for thermoelectrics where we compare two optimization approaches: one relying on topology optimization of the continuous relaxation of the problem, another based on derivative-free genetic algorithm.

By design, we employ therefore the lowest order mixed finite element methods on rectangular grids, and we embed the domains in realistically  simple fictitious domain. This strategy makes tracking the behavior of the entire system feasible while the pre-processing and post-processing efforts are manageable and allow to focus on the deliverables of interest.  This strategy is motivated by applications in human tissue, soil-vegetation systems, and multiphase flow coupled to energy conservation in porous media.

As a first step in quantifying uncertainties in simulated Arctic climate response, we performed a variance-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using a fully coupled ultra-low resolution (ULR) configuration of version 1 of the US Department of Energy’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). We quantify the sensitivity of six Arctic quantities of interest (QOI), which characterize changes in Arctic climate over a 75 year period,  to uncertainties in nine model parameters spanning the sea ice, atmosphere, and ocean components of E3SMv1. Sensitivity indices for each QOI were computed with a Gaussian process emulator using 139 random realizations of the random parameters and fixed preindustrial forcing.  The parameter variations showed significant impact on the Arctic climate state with the largest impact coming from atmospheric parameters in the Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals (CLUBB) scheme. Our results demonstrate the importance of conducting sensitivity analyses with fully coupled climate models and motivate follow-on investigations using the ULR model.

Standard gradient-based optimization techniques work well for realizing unitary gates in smaller quantum systems, but can encounter convergence problems for larger agglomerated gates that involves more than two coupled qubits. In this talk we present a continuation technique that parameterizes intermediate gates to gradually morph from trivial free evolution to a complex unitary gate. By successively increasing the complexity of the target gate, the initial gate duration can be small and gradually increased during the continuation, resulting in an accurate estimate of the minimum gate duration. The proposed technique can be used for finding optimal control pulses for driving larger quantum systems, realizing Hamiltonian simulations, and constructing a family of smoothly varying control pulses for realizing parameterized gates.

Such brain-scale datasets are represented by very large sparse adjacency matrices, often associated with Laplacian or transition matrices. Moreover, rectangular skinny matrices may store features of nodes. Analyses of those data, such as rankings, homophily evaluations, and clusters detections, for example, are often required by those applications and methods. Moreover, the highly hierarchical architectures of the supercomputers allowing such computation, from multicore chips having network on chip, to distributed nodes and data storage units, are not always well-adapted for such computation manipulating non-structured data. Understanding the behaviors of such methods is important and lead to large number of experiments, asking to have fast accesses to many different datasets. In this talk, we first present two dataset generators, directly computed in parallel, allowing to experiment very large problems without any I/O. We introduce an open source software which generates very large datasets inspired from an easy brain structure, experimented on distributed platform and supercomputers. Then, as an example of applications on such graphs, we present results of PageRank methods experimented on several supercomputers. We conclude with analyses of obtained performances with respect of the dataset structures and of the supercomputer architectures

The microscopic bidomain ($\mu$-bidomain) model is a system of partial differential equations describing the evolution of the electric potential within each cell and in the extracellular space. The model accounts for the cellular membrane dynamics and intercellular coupling. From a numerical perspective, the $\mu$-bidomain model poses a number of difficulties: the cellular subdomains are separated by a sharp interface, that is the cellular membrane; the temporal dynamics is confined on such interfaces; and the membrane dynamics is typically multiscale, nonlinear and very stiff in time.  	  In this work, we first recast the problem to a boundary integral formulation and confine the equations on the cellular membrane, on which the temporal dynamics take place.   	  Then, we present some numerical experiments to compare the boundary integral formulation to a more standard finite element approach.

Two classes of preconditioners prove most effective:  multigrid and low-order finite element methods.  For multigrid preconditioners built on geometric $p$-multigrid  on GPU architectures,  the communication dominated coarse grid solve hinders the parallel scalability  of the preconditioner.  We propose a strategy to mitigate the increase coarse grid solve cost at scale  by treating the coarse grid solve as an additive, rather than multiplicative, correction.  This allows overlapping the coarse grid solve, which utilizes the CPU,  and the remainder of the multigrid cycle, which utilizes the GPU.  A hybrid $p$-multigrid and low-order finite element preconditioner  is also proposed.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of these two novel approaches on a variety of  problems arising from the spectral element discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations,  spanning up to $P=6144$ NVIDIA V100 GPUs on Summit.

In the present contribution, we design specific numerical methods for their resolution. The key ingredient in these models is a good choice of state variables, which describe both the polydisperse character of a spray as well as the geometrical dynamics of non spherical droplets. The resulting system of equations is hyperbolic and involves a complex structure: the continuous solutions evolves in a convex set called the realizability domain. This induces constraints on the numerical methods. To achieve accuracy, robustness and realizability, we rely on kinetic finite volume schemes and Discontinuous Galerkin methods.    
We focus on a two-phase simulation of a polydisperse spray with oscillating droplets and assess the ability of the model and of the related numerical methods to capture the physics of such flows.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75538' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1181)' class='star'><span class='star1181'>&star;</span></a> Federico Pichi  <span id='bitlink-3224'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3224)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3224' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3224)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Convolutional Graph Neural Network Approach to Model Order Reduction for Nonlinear Parametrized PDEs</b><br />Federico Pichi<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-259.html'>Reduced Order Modeling of Differential Equations Through Deep Learning Algorithms - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>The development of efficient reduced order models (ROMs) from a deep learning perspective enables users to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches. Convolutional autoencoder structures gained popularity in the ROM community as an extension to linear compression procedures [K. Lee and K. Carlberg.

A comprehensive deep learning-based approach to reduced order modeling of nonlinear time-dependent parametrized PDEs. JSC, 2021].   One drawback of these approaches is the lack of geometrical information when dealing with complex domains defined on unstructured meshes.  The present work proposes a framework for nonlinear model order reduction based on Graph Convolutional Autoencoders (GCA) to exploit emergent patterns in different physical problems, including those that show a bifurcating behavior [F. Pichi, B. Moya, and J. S. Hesthaven. “A convolutional graph neural network approach to model order reduction for non-linear parametrized PDEs”. In preparation, 2022].  The proposed structure exploits the autoencoder paradigm to extract the evolution of the latent space while handling consistently the underlying geometrical domain and alleviating the learning process through pooling and unpooling operations.

It allows for a direct relation of approximations on a coarse mesh with approximations on a fine mesh, enabling adaptive and sparse solvers for PDEs.   The critical concept is interpreting a fine mesh approximation as a coarse mesh approximation with additional finer details. Using this hierarchy, it is simple to move an approximation from a fine mesh to a coarse mesh by truncation of detail coefficients. Doing the reverse is more challenging and requires a reconstruction procedure to generate fine mesh data from coarse information. It is for this purpose we consider the Line Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy-Conserving MRA (LSIAC-MRA) procedure for obtaining detail coefficients. This technique utilizes filtering methods together with multi-wavelet MRA principles to enable the transition of data from coarse to fine resolutions, simultaneously decreasing errors in the fine mesh approximation. Initially developed for uniform meshes (Picklo and Ryan, "Enhance Multiresolution Analysis...",2022), in this talk we will demonstrate the applicability of this filter-based reconstruction technique for error reduction on nonuniform meshes.

This research creates a system for assessing the damage effects of a car as if it were an expert in the investigation. The model predicts the severity and damaged parts of the vehicle, reducing the amount of time and procedure for determining damage in the event of an accident by surveyors. The technology was used to analyze vehicle damage images together with the principles of machine learning in analysis. This is coupled with the use of correlation principles and text analysis to determine the causality of the chronology to be used for analysis based on the information recorded from both parties. Coupled with the system's ability to identify the location and environment of the accident scene, it is used through a central system that stores images and text. The diagnosis uses principles consistent with the database to store patterns of accidents in various ways in accordance with the Disaster Survey Manual under the Land Traffic Act for monitoring the damage. The system can initially determine whether a party is right or wrong, and it can also reduce the process of assessing damages for claims, and reporting an accident for convenience and speed, as well as reducing obstructing traffic on the road.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75347' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1236)' class='star'><span class='star1236'>&star;</span></a> Alexander Pinard  <span id='bitlink-3231'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3231)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3231' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3231)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Convincing Climate Scientists that Compression is a Good Idea; and Making Sure it is!</b><br />Alexander Pinard<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-271.html'>Recent Advances in Lossy Compression and Data Reduction Methods for Scientific Data - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>Climate models typically produce enormous amounts of output data, which storage capacities have not kept up with. That has forced climate scientists to make hard choices about which variables to save, data output frequency, simulation lengths, etc, all of which can negatively impact science objectives.  Therefore, we have been investigating lossy data compression techniques as a means of reducing data storage.  As with any data reduction approach, we must exercise extreme care when applying lossy compression to climate output data to avoid introducing artifacts in the data that could affect scientific conclusions.  Our focus has been on better understanding the effects of lossy compression on spatio-temporal climate data and on gaining user acceptance via careful analysis and testing. We will describe the challenges and concerns that we have encountered and will discuss climate-specific metrics and tools to enable scientists to evaluate the effects of lossy compression and facilitate optimizing compression for each variable.  In particular, we will present our Large Data Comparison for Python (LDCPy) package for visualizing and computing statistics on differences between multiple datasets. We will also demonstrate the usefulness of an alternative to the popular SSIM that we developed, called the Data SSIM (DSSIM), that can be applied directly to the floating-point data in the context of evaluating differences due to lossy compression on large volumes of simulation data.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75613' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(562)' class='star'><span class='star562'>&star;</span></a> Gleb Pogudin  <span id='bitlink-3232'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3232)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3232' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3232)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards Automatic Quadratization for PDEs</b><br />Gleb Pogudin<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-124.html'>Exact Polynomialization and Quadratization of Nonlinear Dynamics - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Quadratization problem is, given a system of ODEs with polynomial right-hand side, transform the system to a system with quadratic right-hand side by introducing new variables.

The foundations of BT lie in the Hankel operator and its singular values.   For continuous-time linear dynamical systems, BT preserves system stability in the reduced model and provides a priori bounds for the model reduction error.     
Although BT is generally conceived as an intrusive method, recent developments in [Gosea/Gugercin/Beattie, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2022] have shown that it can be reformulated as a non-intrusive, data-driven process. In this work, we study the connection between data-driven balancing and the Hankel operator associated with a continuous-time linear dynamical system.   We develop data-driven approximations of the Hankel operator based solely on input-output data and then show how a balanced reduced order realization can be constructed using this approximation. Based on these results, we propose an extension of the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm to a large class of continuous-time systems.

This evolution impacts the flow, which, on its turn, affects the solute transport, the precipitation/dissolution processes and, ultimately, the micro-scale geometry.     
To avoid difficulties related to the evolving geometry inside pores, we propose a phase-field pore-scale model. Employing formal homogenization, a two-scale model is derived, in which the pore-scale and the Darcy-scale model components are coupled through the cell problems, providing the effective parameters. For the resulting model, we discuss an adaptive two-scale scheme. It involves iterations between the scales, linear iterations for solving the nonlinear cell problems, an adaptive selection of the elements wherein the effective parameters are computed, and adaptive mesh refinement.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75299' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(222)' class='star'><span class='star222'>&star;</span></a> Doru Thom A.

For example, two of the top supercomputers, Summit and Frontier, offer huge amounts of computing capabilities meant to enable scientists to execute bigger scientific problems in shorter amounts of time. However, these new systems require existing scientific software to be re-designed and re-implemented to fully utilize the hardware features. Previous assumptions that made software execute efficiently on the supercomputers from 10 years ago, may not comply with recent hardware capabilities. In this work, we will focus on re-designing some algorithms that are heavily used in Planewave Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations. More specifically, we will focus on four algorithms meant to solve a non-linear eigenvalue problem, namely Conjugate Gradient, DIIS, Jacobi Davidson and Unconstrained. For each method we identify the bottlenecks, and devise strategies to overcome the issues and scale the codes to thousands of GPUs. We will highlight the similarities and differences between the four algorithms using our approach.

Discretizations are based on finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) combined with particles-in-cell (PIC) and lead to provable stability due to exact conservation laws. STRUPHY also provides a mid-level API that allows for an easy add-on of new features. We will discuss some of the implemented hybrid models, their discretization and some numerical results in the context of magnetized plasmas. STRUPHY kernels are accelerated to Fortran speed using the open source accelerator Pyccel [https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel]; an MPI/OpenMP hybrid parallelization allows for HPC application of STRUPHY. The package documentation can be found under [https://struphy.pages.mpcdf.de/struphy/index.html].

A variety of fast special function transforms for orthonormal bases consisting of discretized manifold harmonics for highly symmetric geometries exist. For example, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a fast algorithm for applying the discrete Fourier transform, which itself is an orthonormal basis comprised of sampled eigenfunctions of the LBO on a torus. At the same time, the butterfly factorization provides a linear algebraic framework generalizing the FFT based on factoring an $N \times N$ matrix into a product of $O(\log N)$ sparse factors, leading to fast transforms. It has been used to develop fast transforms for systems of orthogonal polynomials. We present an approach to designing subquadratic fast transforms based on butterfly factorizing the LBO eigenmatrix obtained under a finite element discretization of the eigenproblem. Numerical examples taken from computer graphics will be used for illustratation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75327' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(707)' class='star'><span class='star707'>&star;</span></a> Fabien Pourre  <span id='bitlink-3245'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3245)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3245' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3245)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Using New Sets of Eigenvalues to Image Obstacle Density</b><br />Fabien Pourre<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-155.html'>Novel Methods for Inverse Scattering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>The Linear Sampling Method (LSM) aims to image the shape of defects in a known medium from measurements of scattered fields and generally provides satisfactory solutions if multi-static (far field) data is available. However, this method becomes less effective for cluttered defects (for instance a network of cracks). In this talk, we shall present a recently introduced imaging method based on the LSM formalism but that exploits the spectrum of an eigenvalue problem. This eigenvalue problem is specifically designed by the introduction of a modified background so that its analysis in terms of defects size is possible. We prove that the eigenvalues of this problem can be identified from multi-static data. We then exploit this fact to construct an indicator function of the defects density based on the sensitivity of the eigenvalues to the presence and size of these defects.  We shall illustrate the obtained inverse algorithm and its performances on some synthetic numerical experiments.

However, these algorithms are not transparent about the uncertainty in their predictions, giving clinicians a false sense of reliability which may lead to grave consequences for patient care. Growing calls for Transparent and Responsible AI have promoted Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) algorithms that help communicate confidence in the algorithmic predictions. However, traditional Bayesian UQ methods remain prohibitively costly for large, million-dimensional tumor segmentation CNNs such as U-Net. In this talk, we discuss a computationally efficient UQ approach via the partially Bayesian neural networks (pBNN). In pBNN, a single strategically chosen layer is used for targeted Bayesian inference while the rest of the network is trained with less-expensive deterministic methods. Sensitivity Analysis is employed to select the layer for Bayesian inference. We illustrate the benefits of our approach, including computational efficiency, and how practitioners and model developers can use this approach to understand the model’s uncertainty with lowered computational resources.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75659' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1724)' class='star'><span class='star1724'>&star;</span></a> Daniele Prada  <span id='bitlink-3248'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3248)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3248' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3248)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Numerical Simulation and Analysis of Multiscale Interface Coupling Between a Poroelastic Medium and a Lumped Hydraulic Circuit: Comparison Between Functional Iteration and Operator Splitting Methods</b><br />Daniele Prada<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-381.html'>Advances in the Multiscale and Multiphysics Modeling of Biological Fluids: Theoretical and Numerical Aspects - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>We consider a multiscale problem modeling the flow of a fluid through a deformable porous medium, described by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs), connected with a lumped hydraulic circuit, described by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

The accurate numerical characterization of those active transducers, which insonifies the underwater fluid media, plays a crucial role in the subsequent numerical simulations of complex marine environments. The transducers can be quickly characterized experimentally using in-house laboratory equipment where their acoustic response can be obtained from time-harmonic near-field phaseless data. Obviously, the extrapolation of those near-field data to predict the time-harmonic far-field generated pressure cannot be computed straightforwardly and requires estimating the directivity pattern associated with the transducer. Different numerical approaches based on an integral representation of the pressure field are analyzed in this work. Since the phaseless experimental near-field data is known in a reduced number of locations, different polynomial discretizations have been utilized to discretize the directivity pattern taking into account low-order spherical harmonics and standard finite element polynomial approximations. Both approaches are compared in realistic scenarios with available closed-form solutions such as omnidirectional sources and end-fire arrays. The impact of using different phase retrieval and quadrature methods is also quantified.

We show new  machine (deep) learning algorithms that, in combination with data hosted in Digital Rocks Portal, creates the environment that directly links data, high performance computing simulation, and deep-learning-enabled upscaling of velocity field, concentration fields  and electrical potential.

These QoIs are usually not observable, as they may refer to future predictions or predictions in conditions that cannot be reproduced in a laboratory. This raises the fundamental issue of validating a model with respect to these QoIs. Several validation processes and metrics have been proposed to assert whether a model is deemed valid. However, they rarely take into account the QoIs, essentially for the reasons mentioned above. One has then to make a leap of faith to use the model, validated w.r.t. given observables, for predicting other QoIs. Our goal is nevertheless to gain confidence in the predictive capabilities of the model by defining validation experiments specifically designed toward this objective. We propose here a methodology to design a validation scenario that relates the QoIs in the prediction scenario with the observables in the validation scenario. It consists in casting the design of the validation scenario as an optimal design problem. We introduce here an optimal design problem whose objective functional minimizes the difference between sensitivity indices (e.g. Sobol indices) of the QoIs in the prediction scenario and those related with the same QoIs in the validation scenario. We will demonstrate the usefulness of our methodology on several examples by showing that it can identify false positives.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75554' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1042)' class='star'><span class='star1042'>&star;</span></a> Vit Prusa  <span id='bitlink-3256'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3256)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3256' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3256)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Thermodynamic Framework for Non-Isothermal Phenomenological Models of Mullins Effect</b><br />Vit Prusa<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-228.html'>Modeling and Computation for Implicitly Constituted Materials: Fluids, Solids, Plasmas, and Mixtures - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>The Mullins effect is a common name for a family of intriguing inelastic responses of various solid materials, in particular filled rubbers. Given the importance of the Mullins effect, there have been many attempts to develop mathematical models describing the effect. However, most of available models focus exclusively on the mechanical response, and are restricted to the idealised isothermal setting. We lift the restriction to isothermal processes, and we propose a full thermodynamic framework for a class of phenomenological models of Mullins effect. In particular, we identify energy storage mechanisms (Helmholtz free energy) and entropy production mechanisms that on the level of stress--strain relation lead to the idealised Mullins effect or to the Mullins effect with permanent strain. The models constructed within the proposed framework can be used in modelling of fully coupled thermo-mechanical processes, and the models are guaranteed to be consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.

The objective is to determine the positions of external dampers in such a way that the influence of the input on the output is minimized. The energy response serves as an optimization criterion, whose computation involves solving Lyapunov equations. Hence, in order to find the best positions, many of these equations need to be solved, and so the minimization process can have a high computational cost.    
To accelerate the process of finding the optimal positions, we propose a new reduction method. Our algorithm generates a basis spanning an approximation to the solution space of the Lyapunov equations for all possible positions of the dampers. We derive an adaptive scheme that generates the reduced solution space by adding the subspaces of interest, and then we define the corresponding reduced optimization problem that is solvable in reasonable amount of time. We decouple the solution spaces of the problem to obtain a space that corresponds to the system without external dampers and serves as a starting point for the reduction of the optimization problem. In addition, we derive spaces corresponding to the different damper positions that are used to expand the reduced basis if needed. Our new technique produces a reduced optimization problem of significantly smaller dimension that is faster to solve than the original problem, which we illustrate with some numerical examples.

The stochastic Galerkin approach changes the random-dependent system into a larger deterministic system of ODEs. We apply a W-method to the stochastic Galerkin system, where the approximation of the Jacobian matrix has a block-diagonal form. Each block is the Jacobian matrix of the right-hand side in the original random-dependent ODEs inserting the expected value. We investigate the stability of the W-method for stiff linear systems of ODEs. The concept of A-stability is extended using a scalar linear ODE with a single negative random variable. It follows that the stability of the W-method depends on the eigenvalues of the resulting system matrix, the expected value of the random variable, and the coefficients of the numerical scheme. We discuss the stability conditions for W-methods up to four stages with maximum order of convergence. The construction of a W-method satisfying the stability condition is possible for each probability distribution. We present results of numerical computations for a test example.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75653' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(291)' class='star'><span class='star291'>&star;</span></a> Juha-Pekka Puska  <span id='bitlink-3259'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3259)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3259' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3259)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Edge-Promoting Sequential Experimental Design for X-Ray Imaging</b><br />Juha-Pekka Puska<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-65.html'>Stories of Marrying Methods and Applications</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>We consider sequential edge-promoting Bayesian experimental design in X-ray imaging.

However, their applicability and effectiveness depend crucially on the choice of basis functions used to expand the solution of a PDE. The last decade has seen the emergence of deep learning as a strong contender in providing efficient representations of complex functions. In the current work, we present an approach for combining deep neural networks with spectral methods to solve PDEs. In particular, we use a deep learning technique known as the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) to identify candidate functions on which to expand the solution of PDEs. We have devised an approach that uses the candidate functions provided by the DeepONet as a starting point to construct a set of functions that have the following properties: (1) they constitute a basis, (2) they are orthonormal, and (3) they are hierarchical, i.e., akin to Fourier series or orthogonal polynomials. We have exploited the favorable properties of our custom-made basis functions to both study their approximation capability and use them to expand the solution of linear and nonlinear time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach advances the state of the art and versatility of spectral methods and, more generally, promotes the synergy between traditional scientific computing and machine learning.

We focus on electromagnetic/thermal simulations, where Maxwell’s equations are jointly solved with the heat equation in lossy media. In particular, neural networks are used to replace the heat equation solver and directly produce the transient and steady state temperature distribution within the medium, using the material properties and the electric field components, computed by a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulation. Hence, the multiphysics simulation is greatly simplified, as it relies on a single-physics (electromagnetic) solver, combined with a neural network.    
     
The training of the network is based on an unsupervised strategy, where the heat equation is directly implemented as a loss function of the network. This approach is compared to the conventional supervised strategy of using the mean square error (MSE) between ground truth data (produced by a finite difference solver for the heat equation) and the network prediction for the temperature. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of this approach for general multiphysics problems and its applications to the modeling of microwave hyperthermia scenarios in biological tissues.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75698' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(846)' class='star'><span class='star846'>&star;</span></a> Elizabeth Qian  <span id='bitlink-3263'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3263)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3263' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3263)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>New Multifidelity Sobol Estimators for Large-Scale Multidisciplinary Systems: Application to the JW Space Telescope</b><br />Elizabeth Qian<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-185.html'>Scientific Machine Learning to Enable Outer Loop Analysis - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Sobol global sensitivity indices quantify how uncertainty in model inputs contributes to uncertainty in the model output. Such sensitivity indices allow inputs to be ranked in importance and are typically computed using Monte Carlo estimation, but the many samples required for Monte Carlo to be sufficiently accurate can make this computation intractable when the model is expensive. This talk will present a multifidelity Monte Carlo approach to estimating Sobol indices that combines samples from both cheaper lower-fidelity models (e.g., models learned from data) and expensive high-fidelity models to achieve computational acceleration with accuracy guarantees. We present new multifidelity Sobol index estimators based on rank statistics that can estimate Sobol indices for all inputs from a single set of independent samples. This significantly reduces the cost of Sobol analysis when the number of inputs is large. The approach accelerates the computation time required for sensitivity analysis of the JW Space Telescope thermal models from more than two months to less than two days. This demonstrates the power of the multifidelity approach to make sensitivity analysis tractable for large-scale engineering systems in the real world.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75487' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(211)' class='star'><span class='star211'>&star;</span></a> Jingmei Qiu  <span id='bitlink-3264'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3264)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3264' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3264)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Local Macroscopic Conservative (LoMaC) Low Rank Tensor Method with the Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Vlasov Dynamics</b><br />Jingmei Qiu<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-46.html'>Taming the Curse of Dimensionality in Non-Equilibrium Transport Systems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>In this paper, we propose a novel Local Macroscopic Conservative (LoMaC) low rank tensor method with discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization for the physical and phase spaces for simulating the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. The LoMaC property refers to the exact local conservation of macroscopic mass, momentum and energy at the discrete level. The LoMaC low rank tensor algorithm (recently developed in arXiv:2207.00518) simultaneously evolves the macroscopic conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy using the kinetic flux vector splitting; then the LoMaC property is realized by projecting the low rank kinetic solution onto a subspace that shares the same macroscopic observables.     
This paper is a generalization of our previous work, but with DG discretization to take advantage of its compactness and flexibility in handling boundary conditions and its superior accuracy in the long term. Extensive numerical results are performed to showcase the efficacy of the method.           </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75268' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1048)' class='star'><span class='star1048'>&star;</span></a> Fei Qu  <span id='bitlink-3265'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3265)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3265' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3265)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Multilevel Substructuring Method for Fast Vibration Response Calculations of Finite Periodic Structures</b><br />Fei Qu<br />Thursday, March 2 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-229.html'>Modeling and Computation for Implicitly Constituted Materials: Fluids, Solids, Plasmas, and Mixtures - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>Periodic metamaterial structures are attracting increasing interest in the scientific community because of their unique properties that go beyond the ones of natural materials. Due to the often detailed nature of the unit cells (UCs) in these architected structures, the UC finite element models can become large, which would rapidly render finite structure models comprised of UC assemblies computationally unaffordable. To tackle this problem, conventional substructuring approaches approximate the dynamics of the single UC with the subspace and assembly the reduced UCs to obtain the reduced order model. However, the size of the reduced order model grows linearly with respect to the number of UCs. Hence, a natural enhancement is to add more levels of decomposition as the automated multilevel substructuring (AMLS) method. To accelerate this approach even further, we present a multilevel substructuring method combined with the interface reduction and subspace recycling for the forced vibration response calculations of finite periodic structures. We analyze the scaling property of the method numerically comparing with conventional substructuring approaches.

Using a boundary integral formulation, we characterize these changes by simulating erosion of porous media. A Cauchy-integral formulation and associated quadrature formulas enable us to resolve dense configurations of nearly contacting bodies. We observe that substantial anisotropy develops over the course of erosion; that is, the configurations that result from erosion permit flow in the longitudinal direction more easily than in the transverse direction by up to a factor of six. These results suggest that the erosion of solid material from groundwater flows may contribute to previously observed anisotropy of natural porous media.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75857' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1975)' class='star'><span class='star1975'>&star;</span></a> Pat Quillen  <span id='bitlink-3268'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3268)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3268' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3268)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Early Career Scientist Panel: Wow I have a job!

Nonetheless, appealing benefits from the adoption of mixed precision schemes have been reported for the solution of dense and sparse linear systems, on variety of computer architectures, via iterative refinement. In this talk, we will illustrate the benefits of leveraging mixed precision in terms of execution time and energy efficiency. For this purpose, we will target several case studies arising in the iterative solution of sparse linear systems on GPUs, with codes currently integrated the Ginkgo library (https://ginkgo-project.github.io). In some detail, this research effort exploits the fact that, for sparse linear algebra operations, the cost is dominated by the memory accesses while the arithmetic is largely irrelevant. To leverage this property, the Ginkgo solvers store certain parts of the data in reduced precision in memory, but operate in "full" 64-bit precision in order to bound the accumulation of rounding errors. Reduced-precision storage can be then exploited to maintain approximation operators, such as the preconditioner, or in a GMRES-based solver that adjust the precision of the basis to the problem.

It has been demonstrated that varying Nb concentration influences the relative volume fractions of the delta and gamma’’ precipitate phases in the alloy. The Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) framework has been used to statistically quantify the microstructure arrays produced by the PF simulations.  The resulting reduced-order representations capture all of the salient features of the microstructural morphology. Gaussian process autoregression (GPAR), a subset of Gaussian process regression, has been utilized to predict the time evolution of the reduced-order microstructure representations.

Such sub-grid closures must account for the effects of the inhomogeneous particle distribution. Several closure models are available in the literature for free flowing and non-cohesive gas-solid flows. In our present study we expand this existing knowledge by investigate the effect of cohesion on the drag force closure, and by proposing a drag closure concept based on machine learning (ML). The key novelty is that our concept allows the rapid generation of closures, making it possible to create a set of closure laws rather than a single closure that might have limitations.     
First, the results of classical unresolved (but unfiltered) CFD-DEM simulations of cohesive gas-particle flow in a pseudo 2D periodic domain are filtered with different filter sizes. Second, corresponding fully 3D simulations were performed, and filtered in an identical manner. Third, closure models were developed from data of 2D and 3D simulations and compared to each other. ML-closures were derived separately with data from the gravitational and non-gravitational (i.e., horizontal) direction, allowing us to demonstrate that filtered drag anisotropy is significant. Our benchmarking of 2D versus 3D closures suggests that only 3D data should be used for closure development in the case of cohesive powders.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75606' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1091)' class='star'><span class='star1091'>&star;</span></a> Pawel Radtke  <span id='bitlink-3275'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3275)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3275' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3275)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Extension of C++ with a Memory-Centric Specification Language for HPC</b><br />Pawel Radtke<br />Wednesday, March 1 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-239.html'>From Math to Code: Domain-Specific Programming Abstractions, Languages, and Frameworks - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>
The C programming language and its cousins such as C++ lean towards a memory-inefficient storage of structs: developers have to commit to one, invariant data model unless they rearrange the data structures manually, the natural data structure for object-based models is array of structs, and the compiler has to insert bits such that individual attributes align with byte boundaries. Furthermore, the language provides no native support for data exchange via MPI and precision formats beyond the IEEE standard. We propose a language extension based upon C++ attributes which give developers more fine-grained control over the memory implementation of data structures: numerical types tailored to their value ranges with bit-level granularity, automatic bit packing of boolean and enumerable fields, customisable reduced-precision storage types for floating-point data, as well as local declarative conversions between Array-of-Structures to Structure-of-Arrays layouts for "for" and "for-each" loops. Finally, we propose attribute-driven MPI mappings generation for arbitrary data types, including the new data types that we offer.     
  Our proposals are realised via a compiler-based approach by extending the Clang/LLVM compiler toolchain. In the presentation we demonstrate the capabilities of our extensions, as well as show the performance impacts on a set of large-scale smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulation (SPH) codes.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75564' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1824)' class='star'><span class='star1824'>&star;</span></a> Muhammed Rafeek K V  <span id='bitlink-3276'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3276)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3276' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3276)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Observability of Consensus of Multi-Agent Networks Under Signed Laplacian Dynamics</b><br />Muhammed Rafeek K V<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-401.html'>Emerging Techniques for Scalable Graph Processing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Signed multi-agent networks have been an area of recent interest in networks and control community as they involve both cooperative and competitive interactions among its agents. This work establishes the observability conditions of consensus problem of such networks when their agents agrees on signed Laplacian dynamics on a continuous time-scale. The interconnection topology is time-invariant. Under leader--follower framework,  where, the agents of the network are classified into leaders and followers, the necessary and sufficient observability conditions are obtained. Graphical interpretations are provided to gain more insight on the interactions among the agents of the network  and network topology. In addition, the developed results are generic, in the sense that they are not only applicable to signed networks but also to unsigned networks, since unsigned networks are the particular case of signed networks that only contain cooperative agents. Furthermore, we prove that, if the signed multi-agent network is structurally balanced, then the obtained observability conditions will become  equivalent to that of the corresponding unsigned multi-agent network, under some special leaders selection. Numerical  examples are given to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.

The key reason for this popularity is the availability of GPU infrastructure to enable fast matrix calculations  necessary to perform back-propagation—the workhorse behind the design and development of neural network. While backpropagation has been proven effective, it is not without its pitfalls. In this talk, we will discuss the many challenges that arise during the design and development of neural networks through backpropagation—especially in science application. We will then provide alternatives to backpropagation that are both theoretically sound and can be easily amalgamated into the current GPU infrastructure for fast and efficient training of neural networks. We will show that, our alternatives can provide performance equivalent to backpropagation when gradients are available with the added advantage of being able to address scenarios where the gradients may be inaccurate. We will demonstrate the efficiency of these alternatives in GPU infrastructures and in AI accelerators and derives perspectives for future research.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75887' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(737)' class='star'><span class='star737'>&star;</span></a> Tom M.

The method builds the trust-region quadratic models using Powell's derivative-free symmetric Broyden update. An important feature of COBYQA is that it always respects bound constraints if any. COBYQA is competitive with NEWUOA and BOBYQA while being able to handle more general problems. On linearly constrained problems, COBYQA outperforms LINCOA if the problems also contain bound constraints that cannot be violated. Most importantly, COBYQA outperforms COBYLA on all types of problems, no matter whether bound constraints (if any) can be violated or not.    
COBYQA is implemented in Python and publicly available at https://www.cobyqa.com/. This is joint work with Zaikun Zhang.

The wireless sensor network is a network of specialized embedded devices that have limited power and storage which provide sensing services to the Software Defined Internet of Things (SDIoT). The radio unit in a sensor node consumes the most energy, hence, an efficient routing strategy is essential to enhance the network lifetime. Most IoT-based WSN environments suffer from traditional clustering and routing methods, which cause data loss, energy hole issues, and sensor premature death. If it did not use adaptive learning methodologies and continued to use the existing protocol in IoT environment, the network's performance would degrade. In order to overcome these issues, a clustering algorithm based on double Q-learning algorithm is proposed to improve network lifetime and decrease delay in the IoT with uncertain communication links. The simulation findings demonstrate that it outperforms existing clustering and routing algorithms, particularly in terms of performance parameters such as network lifetime, data collection delay and learning rate.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75882' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1260)' class='star'><span class='star1260'>&star;</span></a> Siva Rajamanickam  <span id='bitlink-3280'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3280)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3280' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3280)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Batched Linear Solvers in Kokkos Kernels</b><br />Siva Rajamanickam<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-277.html'>Progresses on Batched Linear Solver Algorithms - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Applications such as multilevel finite element methods, modeling collision in plasma and reentry simulations are reformulating algorithms to match the hierarchical parallel manycore CPUs/GPUs. This reformulation results in a need for linear solvers at different levels of hierarchical parallel algorithms. Several of these linear systems are small or medium size, independent, linear systems that can be solved at the same time. Depending on the problems, some of these linear systems are sparse and others dense. The community has been focused on solving dense linear systems as a batch, or solving multiple small dense linear systems. However, the work has focused primarily on one level of hierarchical parallelism - using an entire accelerator to solve the linear systems. We have been focused on solving batched dense/sparse linear systems, both at the device level and at the team level so applications can use these options effectively. We will present recent results on CPUs/GPUs using our hierarchical parallel batched linear solver implementations.

The 4D-Var method is frequently used to  calculate a forecast model trajectory that best fits the available  observations to within the observational error over a period of time.  One key challenge is that the state vectors used in realistic  applications could contain a very large number of unknowns so,   due to memory limitations, in practice it is often impossible  to assemble, store or manipulate the matrices involved explicitly. In  this talk we present a limited memory approximation to the inverse  Hessian based on multilevel eigenvalues and eigenvectors computed using   the Lanczos method.  We illustrate one use of this approximation by    showing its potential effectiveness as a preconditioner within a Gauss-Newton   iteration and investigate the use of randomised eigenvalue algorithms to  reduce computational costs.

Simulations in theoretical studies of the inner workings of nuclei, in particular, are bound by the use of supercomputers to speed them up. Multigrid methods have brought a way of pushing the computational boundaries in such large-scale simulations, and they open the possibility of scalably simulating at the exascale.    
Unfortunately, under certain extreme situations such as the use of many processes and/or very high condition of the linear systems to be solved, the time spent at the coarsest grid ends up representing most of the execution time in those multigrid solves. If the solver employed at the coarsest level is e.g. GMRES, in which case we see the appearance of many dot products, scalability is at risk. We discuss here different ways in which we can improve the scalability of multigrid solvers by focusing on the coarsest level.    
All of our implementations and tests are performed within our solver library DD-alphaAMG, a solver for large and sparse matrices emerging in lattice quantum chromodynamics, but these techniques are useful in any application where multigrid fails to scale due to coarsest-level restrictions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75645' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(745)' class='star'><span class='star745'>&star;</span></a> Hendrik Ranocha  <span id='bitlink-3285'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3285)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3285' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3285)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Discretization of Elliptic Terms with Improved Convergence Properties Using Summation by Parts Operators</b><br />Hendrik Ranocha<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-163.html'>Constructing and Exploiting Discretizations with the Summation-by-Parts Property - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>Nishikawa (2007) proposed to reformulate the classical Poisson equation as a  steady-state problem for a linear hyperbolic system. This enables a unified  discretization based on hyperbolic PDE solvers, e.g., in the context of  coupled elliptic-hyperbolic systems such as the Euler equations with self-gravity  studied by Schlottke-Lakemper, Winters, Ranocha, and Gassner (2021).  It also results in optimal error estimates for the solution of the elliptic  equation and its gradients, which are of primary interest in self-gravity.  However, it prevents the application of well-known solvers for elliptic  problems such as the (preconditioned) conjugate gradient method.  We show connections to a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method analyzed by  Castillo, Cockburn, Perugia, and Schötzau (2000) that is very difficult to  implement in general. Next, we demonstrate how this method can be implemented  efficiently using summation by parts (SBP) operators, in particular in the  context of SBP DG methods. The resulting scheme combines nice properties of  both the hyperbolic and the elliptic point of view, in particular a high order  of convergence of the gradients, which is one order higher than what one would  usually expect from DG methods for elliptic problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75459' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(31)' class='star'><span class='star31'>&star;</span></a> Sanil Rao  <span id='bitlink-3286'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3286)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3286' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3286)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>GBTLX: High Performance Code Generation of Graph Applications</b><br />Sanil Rao<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-7.html'>Scaling Data Science, AI, and, ML on Massively Multi-Threaded Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>We propose GBTLX, a code generation framework that translates a linear algebraic graph program written with a high level library into a program that would be written by a domain expert. In the front end, GBTLX captures the set of graph library calls within the program. This is then sent to the code generation system, SPIRAL, for semantic analysis and optimization. If a known algorithm is found, SPIRAL will generate a domain expert algorithm in place of those library calls. The code generation process is built with the same building blocks that makes linear algebraic graph processing so appealing, and uses a rule based system to transform those building blocks into known algorithms. The process also supports various graph representations and hardware architectures. The end result is a single source framework that provides domain knowledge at both the algorithmic and architectural level, while keeping a user-friendly medium, a high level library. We show that the generated code for GBTLX achieves performance comparable to others in the larger community.

To this purpose, we rely on particular degrees of freedom that fit with the physical and geometrical nature of the field to interpolate: the weights on small k-simplices. A weight is the integral of a k-form on a k-simplex. As nodal evaluations of a scalar field are done at the nodes of suitably selected sets in the mesh elements, similarly, weights of a field, intended as a k-form, are computed,  in each mesh element,  on suitably selected sets of simplices of dimension k, called small k-simplices  (that are nodes for k = 0, edges if k = 1, faces for k = 2, volumes for k = n). Weigths on small k-simplices play the role of interpolation coefficients when reconstructing scalar/vector fields in terms of a set of selected multivariate polynomial forms.  As in the nodal case, a generalised Lebesgue constant pops up naturally to measure the stability of the interpolation and the Runge phenomenon may appear for particular distributions of small k-simplices.

Numerical modelling permits to understand and predict the evolution of these complex natural systems resolving the underlying physical processes in three dimensions.

We here present innovative software tools which provide a way forward in ice dynamics and computational Earth sciences by exploiting massively parallel supercomputing on graphics processing units (GPUs) and scalable iterative solvers. We use Julia language because it features high-level capabilities without compromising high performance and portability amongst multiple backends (e.g., multi-core CPUs, and NVIDIA and AMD GPUs). We will compare different Julia multi-GPU full-Stokes solvers for ice flow with thermo-mechanical coupling and discuss the performance of various discretisation and boundary conditions approaches as well as compare the efficiency of the solvers.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75353' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1818)' class='star'><span class='star1818'>&star;</span></a> Thilina Rathnayake  <span id='bitlink-3290'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3290)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3290' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3290)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Exascale Workflows</b><br />Thilina Rathnayake<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-400.html'>Exascale Software and Algorithms for High-Order PDE Solvers - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>With leadership class computing facilities commissioning powerful computers  that are getting closer to exascale, users of these facilities are trying to solve much harder and larger problems as fast as possible. There are numerous challenges faced by users in adapting their code, algorithms and workflow in preparation for future exascale systems. Looking at state of the art pre-exascale systems in the U.S., we can see that these systems increasingly use accelerators or General Purpose Graphic Processing Units (GPGPUs). Developing scalable algorithms and implementing them efficiently on these systems is a challenging task, partly due to complicated memory hierarchies of GPGPUs and the complexity of programming models involved. With exascale computers reaching large number of processors, users also have to pay extra attention to how to decompose their problem and communicate efficiently among different processors in these distributed memory parallel computers. In this talk, we go through the challenges faced when porting spectral element codes to efficiently utilize leadership class computing systems in preparation for exascale machine and how we manage to solve them for exascale and beyond.

These problems arise as first order optimality conditions of optimization ones over BV (or Sobolev) spaces with appropriate gradient constraints, and are useful in the modelling of the growth of non-homogeneous material piles. In this setting, the upper bound in the constraint is either a function or a Borel measure which allows the pile growth to observe discontinuities. We rigorously identify the Fenchel pre-dual problem, and consider primal-dual type algorithms for the approximation of solutions.  Further, we investigate the perturbation of solutions to the problem by means of perturbation of the upper bound of the gradient constraint and establish stability results.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75861' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1363)' class='star'><span class='star1363'>&star;</span></a> Krunal Raval  <span id='bitlink-3292'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3292)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3292' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3292)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Isogeometric Analysis Based on Tchebysheffian Splines</b><br />Krunal Raval<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-301.html'>Advances in Isogeometric Analysis on Complex Geometries - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>Tchebycheffian splines are piecewise smooth functions with pieces in Tchebycheff spaces, the natural generalization of polynomial spaces. Under suitable assumptions, Tchebycheffian splines can be represented in terms of B-spline like basis functions, called Tchebycheffian B-splines, with structural similarities and all fundamental properties of classical polynomial B-splines (compact support, non-negativity, partition of unity, etc.). Tchebycheffian splines offer a huge flexibility compared to classical polynomial splines: they are equipped with parameters that can be selected according to a problem-oriented strategy, taking into account the geometrical and/or analytical issues of the specific addressed problem.     
While the tensor-product approach can easily build multivariate splines, they lack adequate adaptive local refinement, which could be important in both geometric modelling and numerical simulation. This triggered the interest in alternative (polynomial) spline structures supporting local refinement still retaining the local tensor-product structure. Since Tchebycheffian B-splines are plug-to-plug compatible with polynomial B-splines, they are naturally compatible with the local refinement structures known for polynomial B-splines (Hierarchical mesh, T-spline mesh and Locally Refined(LR-) mesh).    
In this talk, we discuss the use of Tchebycheffian splines equipped with a local tensor-product structure as a possible tool in IGA with adaptive refinement.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75663' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1872)' class='star'><span class='star1872'>&star;</span></a> Stephan Rave  <span id='bitlink-3293'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3293)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3293' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3293)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>pyMOR - Model Order Reduction with Python</b><br />Stephan Rave<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2005)' class='star'><span class='star2005'>&star;</span></a> Stephan Rave  <span id='bitlink-3294'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3294)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3294' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3294)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>pyMOR - Model Order Reduction with Python</b><br />Stephan Rave<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-415.html'>pyMOR - Model Order Reduction with Python - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77165' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1057)' class='star'><span class='star1057'>&star;</span></a> Kislaya Ravi  <span id='bitlink-3295'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3295)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3295' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3295)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multi-Fidelity No-U-Turn Sampling</b><br />Kislaya Ravi<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-231.html'>Accelerating Computational Science and Engineering via Data-Driven Learning and Nonlinear Model Reduction - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and No-U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) are a family of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that incorporate first-order derivative to avoid random walk behavior which negatively impact the performance of many MCMC algorithms. However, calculation of derivative becomes impractical for computational expensive problems. We propose to build a multi-fidelity surrogate model using Gaussian Process and then use the derivative from the surrogate to generate proposals for NUTS. The multi-fidelity surrogate is built upon a hierarchy of models of decreasing approximation error and increasing computational cost where we delegate the majority of computational cost to the lower fidelity models. The samples are accepted/rejected according to the delayed acceptance criterion to ensure the detailed balance with respect to highest fidelity model. Then we test our problem on some  test cases and compare it to existing methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75553' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1109)' class='star'><span class='star1109'>&star;</span></a> Saiprasad Ravishankar  <span id='bitlink-3296'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3296)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3296' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3296)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Improving the Robustness of Deep Unrolling-based MRI Reconstruction by Learned Randomized Smoothing</b><br />Saiprasad Ravishankar<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-244.html'>Recent Advances in Inverse Problems for Computational Imaging - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Since the data collection in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sequential and slow, many methods have been proposed to improve image reconstruction from accelerated scans involving limited or undersampled measurements. Recently, deep learning-based methods have gained much popularity for the reconstruction of medical images. However, many currently available deep learning methods for MRI reconstruction are not too robust: small adversarial changes to the input can result in very substantial changes in the output reconstruction. In this work, we propose a novel framework to improve the robustness of deep learning-based MRI reconstruction inspired by and extended from the celebrated randomized smoothing (RS) technique in robust learning. Yet, different from conventional RS-based robustification techniques for classification networks, we work with deep unrolling-based reconstruction networks (e.g., MoDL), which impose new challenges of how to integrate RS with the involved unrolling operations. In our proposal, we augment RS with a learnable reweighting network, which yields a new variant of RS that we call learned RS. We tested the learned RS by injecting worst-case adversarial attacks as well as random noise into the MRI measurements. Our proposed scheme demonstrates significantly better accuracy-robustness trade-offs at a variety of MRI data undersampling factors compared to the conventional MoDL networks.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75569' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1913)' class='star'><span class='star1913'>&star;</span></a> Chiara Razzetta  <span id='bitlink-3297'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3297)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3297' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3297)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Narrowband Transmit Beam Pattern in Medical Ultrasound: a Stochastic Approach to Delays Optimization</b><br />Chiara Razzetta<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(402)' class='star'><span class='star402'>&star;</span></a> Beatriz Recinos  <span id='bitlink-3298'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3298)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3298' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3298)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Framework for Time-Dependent Ice Sheet Uncertainty Quantification, Applied to Three West Antarctic Ice Streams</b><br />Beatriz Recinos<br />Thursday, March 2 3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-89.html'>Advanced Computational Methods for Ice-Sheet Modeling and Analysis - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>We seek to characterise the uncertainty in model projections of marine ice sheet loss, which arises from calibration with data. Here, we use a Bayesian approach, to quantify the degree to which observational uncertainty translates to parametric uncertainty (posterior uncertainty of inversions for basal drag and ice stiffness fields) and to uncertainty in projected quantities of interest (QoIs) such as sea level contribution. Our framework implements the Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA), and a control methods approach to invert for the basal drag and ice stiffness fields. Beginning with a cost function optimization which can allow for either gridded or point-cloud velocities, we generate a low-rank approximation to the posterior covariance of the parameters via the use of the cost function Hessian. In our work, the Hessian is calculated through algorithmic differentiation (AD) using the &#8220;complete” Hessian rather than the Gauss–Newton approximation. We then project the covariance on a linearization of the time-dependent ice sheet model to estimate the growth of the QoI uncertainty over time. We apply for the first time this framework to real ice streams in the Amundsen basin, and present several model experiments exploring the impact on uncertainty due to different strengths of priors, sliding laws and velocity inputs. We explore the model capabilities when we applied it to these ice streams and lay out our plans to scale our framework into a larger domain.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75353' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(910)' class='star'><span class='star910'>&star;</span></a> Michael Redle  <span id='bitlink-3299'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3299)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3299' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3299)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A New Unstaggered Locally Divergence-Free Finite Volume Scheme for Ideal and Shallow Water Magnetohydrodynamics</b><br />Michael Redle<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-199.html'>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>Many mathematical models of fundamental interest are constrained by the infamous divergence-free condition of magnetic fields or velocity profiles. Seen within a wide range of astrophysical, geophysical, and engineering applications, such divergence-free constraints are physically and analytically exact. On a discrete level, however, an improper treatment of an identically-zero divergence may lead to large instabilities in solutions – even when applying methods that already successfully simulate fluids without this constraint. Thus, a careful algorithmic construction is required to ensure these constraints are exactly preserved within numerical approximations. In this talk, we restrict our attention to an important sub-class of divergence-free systems – the magnetohydrodynamic equations, keeping in mind that the developed method can be extended to other models constrained by zero-divergence. We present a new method that exactly preserves the divergence-free condition of the magnetohydrodynamic system on an unstaggered mesh. The designed method has been successfully tested on several examples.

Typically, such computations are based on regression, a method that suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, the objective of this talk is to establish dimension reduction schemes for large-scale asset price models and to solve related optimal stopping problems (e.g. Bermudan option pricing) in the reduced setting, where regression is feasible. The proposed algorithm is based on an error measure between linear stochastic differential equations. We establish optimality conditions for this error measure with respect to the reduce system coefficients and propose a particular method that satisfies these conditions up to a small deviation. We illustrate the benefit of our approach in several numerical experiments, in which Bermudan option prices are determined.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75470' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1186)' class='star'><span class='star1186'>&star;</span></a> Jonah A.

The method is suitable for implementation on hardware accelerators such as graphical processing units (GPUs). The current gold standard for sparse indefinite systems is the LBL factorization where L is a lower triangular matrix and B is 1X1 or 2X2 block diagonal. However, this requires pivoting, which substantially increases communication cost and degrades performance on GPUs. Our approach solves a large indefinite system by solving multiple smaller positive definite systems, using an iterative solver on the Schur complement and an inner direct solve (via Cholesky factorization) within each iteration. Cholesky is stable without pivoting, thereby reducing communication and allowing reuse of the symbolic factorization. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach on large optimal power flow problems and show that it can efficiently utilize GPUs and outperform LBL factorization of the full system.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75385' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1043)' class='star'><span class='star1043'>&star;</span></a> Andrew Reid  <span id='bitlink-3304'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3304)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3304' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3304)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Oof Finite-Element Solver for Materials Science: Plasticity and Ml</b><br />Andrew Reid<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-228.html'>Modeling and Computation for Implicitly Constituted Materials: Fluids, Solids, Plasmas, and Mixtures - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>The Object-Oriented Finite Element code (OOF) is a long-standing project developed at NIST to deliver high-quality mathematics and computational capabilities to an audience of materials scientists.

We solve analytically a lattice Boltzmann model for planar channel flow to determine its deviatoric stress tensor. We find that the model contains an additional tangential stress, proportional to the square of the Knudsen number, that matches the stress in the Burnett equations. This additional stress has zero divergence, and hence does not affect the flow directly. However, the neglect of this additional stress by existing boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method triggers spurious oscillations in the computed solutions. We propose new Burnett stress boundary conditions and analyse them theoretically. We show that they completely eliminate the oscillations, and agree precisely with analytical solutions at second order in Knudsen number. We combine these Burnett stress conditions with Navier-Maxwell slip boundary conditions to study rarefied flows in microcavities. We show that our algorithm captures non-equilibrium effects in the pressure that are not captured by the Navier-Stokes equations. The results are in very good agreement with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions of the Boltzmann equation.

While some of the particles and interactions are well known, oftentimes not all dynamics are fully understood. Therefore, pure physics-based modeling approaches are not always successful.     
Apart from that, some outcomes of the considered biological processes are usually observable on a macroscopic scale. Although, the observations mostly do not include time and space resolved measurements of all interacting components but some information at discrete times. These observations serve as quantitative data for the biological applications. The quantitative data is usually not sufficient for pure data-driven approaches.     
In this talk, ideas on how to use the rare data in a model selection process are presented: Mesoscopic models connect the different scales by abstracting from the microscopic particles and interactions. The few microscopic information on mechanisms and the observation on the macroscopic scale enable together physics-informed machine learning techniques for the mesoscopic model.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75313' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1649)' class='star'><span class='star1649'>&star;</span></a> Sean Reiter  <span id='bitlink-3308'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3308)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3308' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3308)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Power System Event Location via DEIM</b><br />Sean Reiter<br />Friday, March 3 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-364.html'>Simulation-Based UQ Methods - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>Real-time event analysis is critical for the successful security and operation of electrical power systems. Gone unchecked, local disturbances can cascade into wide area failures (see e.g., the 2003 Northeastern United States blackout). Data-driven analysis techniques based on low-rank matrix factorizations of system measurements have gained popularity in recent years due to the increased deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs). In this talk, we introduce a selection procedure for locating the source power system events from real-time data based on the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM). The DEIM selection algorithm parses the dominant singular vectors of the collected measurements in order to select a set of representative row indices, each corresponding to measurements at a particular bus. These selected indices serve as a proxy for identifying the buses most affected by an event, and locate the source of the initial fault with high accuracy. Numerical results involving synthetically generated PMU data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75800' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1875)' class='star'><span class='star1875'>&star;</span></a> Severin Reiz  <span id='bitlink-3309'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3309)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3309' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3309)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Training Large-Scale Neural Networks with a Newton Conjugate Gradient Method</b><br />Severin Reiz<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(396)' class='star'><span class='star396'>&star;</span></a> Kui Ren  <span id='bitlink-3310'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3310)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3310' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3310)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Hybrid Learning-Inversion Reconstruction Scheme for Inverse Transport Problems</b><br />Kui Ren<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-88.html'>Numerics of Inverse Problems for Kinetic Models and Their Corresponding Macroscopic PDEs - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>We propose a computational framework to couple machine learning methods with classical model-based computational inversion techniques for nonlinear inverse problems to the radiative transport equation.

The tendency is defined empirically by a set of criteria and captures the large-scale temporal variability of the original signal as well as the most frequent events in its histogram. Among other properties, the tendency has a variance no larger than that of the original signal; the histogram of the difference between the original signal and the tendency is as symmetric as possible; and with reduced complexity, the tendency captures essential features of the signal.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75623' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1974)' class='star'><span class='star1974'>&star;</span></a> Juan M.

Thus, it is necessary to develop accurate yet cost-effective models for outer-loop problems involving turbulent flows. One way is to use multifidelity models (MFMs) which aim at accurately predicting quantities of interest (QoIs) and their stochastic moments by combining the data obtained from different fidelities. When constructing MFMs, a balance is sought between a few expensive (but accurate) simulations and many more inexpensive (but potentially less accurate) simulations. Two main characteristics have to be considered. 1) there is a distinguishable hierarchy in the fidelity of the turbulence simulation approaches such as RANS, hybrid RANS-LES, LES, and DNS. 2) the outcome of any of these approaches can be potentially uncertain due to various inherent uncertainties.  We further develop and apply a MFM that is consistent with these characteristics and is based on the Gaussian processes (GP). The fidelity-specific calibration parameters as well as the hyperparameters appearing in the GPs are simultaneously estimated within a Bayesian framework. The Bayesian inference is done using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, and the predictions of the MFM are accompanied by estimates of the confidence intervals. The efficiency and performance of this MFM are illustrated for various problems involving turbulent flows.

Unfortunately the exascale-era version of the high-performance computing (HPC) landscape is dramatically different from the HPC landscape which was present when NWChem was originally designed. Of specific note: HPC hardware is increasingly heterogeneous, C/C++ has replaced Fortran as the dominant HPC language, and object-oriented programming is now the prevailing design paradigm. Ultimately, in order to adopt NWChem to the exascale era, the decision was made to write an entirely new program from scratch.The result is NWChemEx.    
NWChemEx is written in modern object-oriented C++ (presently C++ 17, with the intent to adopt newer C++ standards as compiler support allows). All user-facing C++ application programming interfaces (APIs) are mirrored in Python 3. From a software architecture standpoint, NWChemEx takes separation of concerns to an extreme. The entire package is written as a series of plugins, where each plugin consists of self contained code modules. To the extent possible, the entire code is written using a single instruction, multiple data design paradigm, in turn allowing parallelism to be treated separately from the implementation of new functionality.    
This talk will explain the architecture and design of NWChemEx in more detail including the rationale underpinning our decisions and the challenges faced in implementing NWChemEx.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75714' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(323)' class='star'><span class='star323'>&star;</span></a> David F.

We share the process we applied at the laboratory with the hope that others will be able to learn from both our successes and intermediate setbacks.

When the code is structured appropriately, modern compilers can auto-vectorize very effectively, and almost ideal vectorization can be achieved. As an added benefit, the maintenance and portability burden of special intrinsics and special programming instructions can be avoided.     The structure of the code may also need to vary depending on the machine architecture. In general, memory bandwidth is a more important factor than raw floating-point performance. A performance model is presented, based on empirical data such as cache bandwidths and flops, to guide the optimization process and algorithm selection.      Finally, automatic code generation is used to write suitable code for different kernels, whilst incorporating the insights from the performance model and compiler-friendly code design.     We present the node-level performance of our generated code for three different architectures: Intel Icelake, Fujitsu A64fx, and AMD Milan processors.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75375' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1314)' class='star'><span class='star1314'>&star;</span></a> Cl&#233;ment Richefort  <span id='bitlink-3319'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3319)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3319' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3319)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multigrid Method for the Indefinite Helmholtz Equation</b><br />Cl&#233;ment Richefort<br />Thursday, March 2 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-289.html'>Krylov and Algebraic Multigrid Solvers at ExaScale</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>It is well known that multigrid methods are very competitive in solving a wide range of SPD problems. However achieving such performance for non-SPD matrices remains an open problem. In particular, two main issues may arise when solving a Helmholtz problem. Some eigenvalues become negative or even complex, requiring the choice of an adapted smoothing method for capturing them. Moreover, since the near-kernel space is oscillatory, the geometric smoothness assumption cannot be used to build efficient interpolation rules. We present some investigations about designing a method that converges in a constant number of iterations with respect to the wavenumber. The method builds on an ideal reduction-based framework and related theory for SPD matrices to correct an initial least squares minimization coarse selection operator formed from a set of smoothed random vectors.

Those rates deteriorate  if the error is measured in stronger norms.  Numerically, often higher convergence rates than the predicted   ones are observed if smooth functions are approximated.  One explanation is the so-called doubling trick.

Historically the solving of computational fluid dynamics problems relies on finite elements and finite volume methods, meaning complex meshes and an important number of degrees of freedom are used to estimate solutions to governing equations. Recently however the development of the Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) has emerged as a promising tool to improve the solution methods to these equations. The purpose of this talk is to assess different variants of these methods on a few representative equations from fluid dynamics. We aim to show how the performance and the precision of different types of models are affected by altering networks hyper-parameters including altering number of hidden layers, number of neurons to a hidden layers and the use of different activation functions including locally adaptive functions which have been shown to improve the accuracy of estimators. We will propose then some alternatives to the state of the art.

Despite the tremendous progress in computational resources and methodologies over the last two decades, these high-fidelity models are still computationally expensive and require a significant amount of expertise. Operator learning frameworks like Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently become popular due to their demonstrated capability to approximate nonlinear operators between infinite dimensional Banach spaces, thus allowing them to learn solution operators to the partial differential equations that describe various hydrodynamic processes. We explore the use of such operator inference methods to construct reduced order models (ROMs) that can approximate coupled coastal wave-circulation systems governed by shallow water hydrodynamics and high-fidelity wave approximation models. The efficiency and accuracy of these models are studied using both benchmark problems with analytical results as well as physically realistic 2D problems. We also investigate the optimal combination of physics-based regularization losses and required high-fidelity training data, as well as perform automated hyper-parameter searches to formulate design guidelines for future efforts in this area.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75833' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1340)' class='star'><span class='star1340'>&star;</span></a> Matteo Rizzi  <span id='bitlink-3326'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3326)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3326' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3326)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>2D Tensor Network Optimization via Automatic Differentiation</b><br />Matteo Rizzi<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-295.html'>Computational Aspects of Tensor Networks - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>Two-dimensional quantum many-body systems exhibit some of the most elusive problems in condensed matter physics, whose solution is foreseen to impact material science and information processing. In recent years, practical progress has been made towards finding an approximation to their ground-state(s) by means of tensor-network ansatzes, in particular (infinite) projected entangled pair states (iPEPS). Based on the variational principle, such ground-state search can be formulated as a highly non-linear optimization problem, for which well established gradient-based non-linear optimization strategies like conjugate gradient or quasi-Newton methods could be employed. Computing explicitly the gradient via a plethora of tensor contractions to be programmed case-by-case has traditionally obstructed this approach. Nowadays, algorithmic differentiation has considerably eased the path, and the variational procedure has been demonstrated to yield lower energies and less biased many-body configurations than alternative methods like imaginary-time evolution. Here, we report on our implementation of a flexible and efficient library for this state-of-the-art approach in the programming language Julia, based on the TensorKit package, and we showcase some results on frustrated 2d quantum spin models.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75656' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(24)' class='star'><span class='star24'>&star;</span></a> Pieterjan Robbe  <span id='bitlink-3327'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3327)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3327' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3327)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Surrogate-Assisted Data-Free Inference with Summary Statistics for Predicting XE Diffusivity in UO2 Nuclear Fuel</b><br />Pieterjan Robbe<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-5.html'>Advanced UQ with Challenging Models - Software and Methods - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>We present a data-free inference framework to estimate the parameters in an atomistic model for the diffusivity of Xe fission gas in UO2 nuclear fuel.

In order to keep our approach computationally tractable, we replace evaluations of the forward model by evaluations of a prebuilt polynomial chaos surrogate model with a reduced number of parameters. This reduced set of parameters is identified by a two-step dimension reduction process, involving a global sensitivity analysis study as well as the construction of a likelihood-informed subspace. We discuss the performance of our calibration strategy, and consider a weighted construction that accounts for the different number of data points in each experimental data set. Finally, we investigate how the surrogate can be used to speed up the estimation of the parameters of the actual forward model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75191' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(434)' class='star'><span class='star434'>&star;</span></a> Matthieu Robeyns  <span id='bitlink-3328'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3328)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3328' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3328)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Mixed Precision Iterative Refinement for Low-Rank Matrix and Tensor Approximations</b><br />Matthieu Robeyns<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-96.html'>Mixed Precision Algorithms in Numerical Linear Algebra - Part II of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>We present a new mixed precision algorithm to compute low-rank matrix and tensor approximations, a fundamental task in numerous applications in scientific computing and data analysis.

We carry out an error analysis of our algorithm which proves that we can reach a high accuracy while performing most of the operations in low precision. We measure the cost of the algorithm depending on the numerical rank of the input as well as the speed ratio between low and high precision arithmetic. We identify two situations where our method has a strong potential : when the hardware provides fast low precision matrix-multiply-accumulate units, and when the numerical rank of the input is small at low accuracy levels. We assess the potential of our algorithm for computing various low-rank matrix and tensor decompositions such as SVD, QR, Tucker, hierarchical Tucker, and tensor-train.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75367' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(805)' class='star'><span class='star805'>&star;</span></a> Carmen Rodrigo  <span id='bitlink-3329'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3329)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3329' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3329)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On a Stabilized Scheme for Biot's Model</b><br />Carmen Rodrigo<br />Monday, February 27 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-175.html'>Reliable and Efficient Methods for Coupled Problems in Porous Media - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Nonphysical oscillations might appear in the numerical solution of the fluid pressure for the quasi-static Biot's model for poroelasticity when standard finite element discretizations are considered for the discretization of the model.

We consider different finite element discretizations and illustrate how such a stabilized scheme provides numerical solutions that are free of non-physical oscillations. The new scheme allows us to iterate the fluid and mechanics problems in a fashion similar to the well-known fixed-stress split method.

At the same time algorithms for computational contact mechanics are notoriously difficult to implement and only very few results regarding scalability of the algorithms in parallel are available. Our goal is to develop a scalable and robust implementation for frictional contact problems as an open-source extension to the FEniCSx framework. FEniCSx is the most recent version of FEniCS, an open source software for solving partial differential equations based on finite element methods. One of the most attractive features of FEniCS is the so-called Unified Form Language (ufl) which allows the user to express the PDE in a notation very close to mathematical notation. One major challenge is that integrals on the contact surfaces typically cannot be expressed as a ufl-form. In our implementation, we combine custom integration kernels on the contact surfaces with automatically generated kernels based on ufl-forms for all remaining integrals. Currently, we use Nitsche's method to enforce the contact constraints, but in principle other methods, such as Lagrange multiplier methods, can be implemented in a similar fashion.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75869' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(620)' class='star'><span class='star620'>&star;</span></a> Lassi Roininen  <span id='bitlink-3331'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3331)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3331' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3331)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Recent Advancements of Non-Gaussian Processes in Bayesian Inversion</b><br />Lassi Roininen<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-136.html'>Statistical Inverse Problems: Theory and Computation - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>This talk is focused on the recent work, which has considered the promotion of non-Gaussian priors for tasks in inverse problems.

Scaling theory predicts that a field effect transistor (FET) with a thin barrier and a thin gate-controlled region will be robust against short-channel effects down to very short gate lengths. The possibility of having channels that are just one atomic layer thick is perhaps the most attractive feature of graphene for its use in transistors.    
Main drawbacks of a large-area monolayer graphene are the  zero gap and, for graphene on substrate, the degradation of the mobility [G. Nastasi, V. Romano, A full coupled drift-diffusion-Poisson simulation of a GFET, Commun. Nonlinear Sci. Numer. Simulat., Vol. 87 (2020), 105300]. In [G. Nastasi and V. Romano, An efficient GFET structure, IEEE Transaction on  Electron Devices 68 (9) 2021, 4729] the authors propose a new geometry which seems very promising to get an efficient Graphene Field Effect Transistor (GFET). The simulations are based on a degenerate drift-diffusion model.  Here the same GFET is simulated by directly solving the semiclassical Boltzmann equation by using a Discontinuous Galerkin approach.

The inverse design of freeform optical surfaces involves solving a nonlinear PDE called a generalized Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation. This PDE can be derived using the laws of geometrical optics and conservation of energy. The laws of geometrical optics define an optical map which connects coordinates on the source to coordinates on the target. Substituting the mapping into the relation for energy conservation leads to a nonlinear second-order PDE for the location of the optical surface.     
I developed a generic framework to derive the PDEs for a wide range of optical systems (e.g., involving parallel and point light sources with parallel, point and near- and far-field targets). This framework can be applied to optical systems that can be described using a cost function in optimal transport theory. However, many optical systems cannot be cast as optimal-transport problems, e.g., systems involving near-field targets or multiple freeform surfaces. For these systems I generalized the concept of a cost function to a generating function. In these cases, the PDE for the location of the optical surface is a so-called generated Jacobian equation.    
The PDEs can be solved using a least-squares numerical algorithm. I will present 16 optical systems that all fit into this framework.

Among the possible solutions, there are purely data-driven methods that leverage nonlinear approximation techniques such as autoencoders and their variants to learn a latent representation of the dynamical system, and then evolve it in time with another architecture. Despite their success in many applications where standard linear techniques fail, more has to be done to increase the interpretability of the results, especially outside the training range and not in regimes characterized by an abundance of data. Not to mention that none of the knowledge on the physics of the model is exploited during the predictive phase. In this talk, in order to overcome these weaknesses, we implement a variant of the nonlinear manifold method introduced in previous works with hyper-reduction achieved through reduced over-collocation and teacher-student training of a reduced decoder. We test the methodology on a 2d nonlinear conservation law model and compare the results we would obtain with a purely data-driven method for which the dynamics is evolved in time with a long-short term memory network.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75309' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2031)' class='star'><span class='star2031'>&star;</span></a> Caoimhe Rooney  <span id='bitlink-3336'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3336)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3336' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3336)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Mathematics: From Smoothies to the Stars</b><br />Caoimhe Rooney<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:20 PM&ndash;9:40 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-424.html'>Public Event: The Role of Mathematics in Solving the World's Main Challenges</a> (8:00 PM&ndash;10:00 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Ever wonder how blenders manage to chop fruit and smash ice into tiny particles to make the perfect smoothie?

Equipped with this advantage, we discuss algorithms, under the general name of Newton-MR, which can be used for optimization of general non-convex objectives, and that come with favorable complexity guarantees. We also give numerical examples demonstrating the performance of these methods for various non-convex problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75359' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(750)' class='star'><span class='star750'>&star;</span></a> Klaus Roppert  <span id='bitlink-3338'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3338)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3338' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3338)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient 3D Finite Element Scheme for Solving Electromagnetic Field Problems Considering Vector Hysteresis</b><br />Klaus Roppert<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-164.html'>Computational Methods for Electric Machines - Part I of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Simulations of nonlinear magnetic field problems often use unique history-independent material laws, such as the commutation- or anhysteretic curve. However, the motivation to optimize, e.g., T-joints in three phase transformers or the field distribution in electric drives, improved and more realistic material models are needed.  In this work, an energy based (EB) vector hysteresis model is used as a constitutive law with memory, which shows high potential for physically and thermodynamically consistent modeling of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials with high precision and efficiency.  The model itself is based on consistent thermodynamic priniciples and allows an efficient numerical implementation by utilizing the convexity of the Gibbs energy potential, leading to a scalar optimization problem, for which a Newton-Raphson method is used.  This material model is then used in a reduced magnetic scalar potential formulation in 2D and 3D for which the nonlinear permeability $\mu(\mathbf H)$ (as a result of the EB model) can be used, contrary to $\mathbf B$-based formulation, where the reluctivity $\nu(\mathbf B)$ is needed. This is a major advantage because the dependence on $\mathbf B$ would require an inversion of the hysteresis model, which is, to the authors knowledge, acausal. The nonlinear electromagnetic problem is then solved by means of a Quasi-Newton scheme, using Good Broyden’s method and different line search approaches are compared.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75460' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(555)' class='star'><span class='star555'>&star;</span></a> Henrik Rosenberger  <span id='bitlink-3339'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3339)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3339' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3339)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Energy-Stable ROM-Based Closure Modelling</b><br />Henrik Rosenberger<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-121.html'>Model Order Reduction Methods for Parameterized Fluid Flows - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>We propose a ROM-based closure model for turbulent flow that conserves the total kinetic energy.    
For this purpose, we start by considering an energy-conserving DNS discretization which is too expensive to be used in multi-query applications. To reduce the computational cost, we introduce a discrete filter matrix. Applying this discrete filter to the DNS velocity vector, we get a discretely filtered velocity vector with significantly smaller dimension. The information that is lost in this filtering process we call subgrid velocity.     
When simulating the dynamics of the filtered velocity, we cannot neglect the effects of the subgrid velocity. To take these subgrid effects into account, we approximate the subgrid velocity within a reduced basis. We obtain this reduced basis via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of subgrid velocity snapshots.     
The resulting model consists of the filtered velocity and the approximated subgrid velocity and has a significantly smaller dimension than the DNS model. In contrast to classical model order reduction, we do not aim at reproducing the complete dynamics of the DNS model but only the filtered velocity.    
By preserving the structure of the underlying DNS discretization, we guarantee the proposed reduced order model to be energy-conserving and hence Lyapunov-stable.

Efficient numerical methods for Boltzmann-BGK should be asymptotic-preserving, which allows the numerical method to be stable at fixed mesh parameters for any value of the Knudsen number, including in the fluid (very small Knudsen numbers), slip flow (small Knudsen numbers), transition (moderate Knudsen numbers), and free molecular flow (large Knudsen numbers) regimes. In this work we develop a novel approach for solving the Boltzmann-BGK equation for achieving both arbitrary high-order and the asymptotic-preserving property. The proposed method is a locally-implicit discontinuous Galerkin (LIDG) scheme with careful modification in both the prediction and correction steps to achieve the asymptotic-preserving property. Some key advantages of the proposed schemes are: (1) no splitting between macroscale and microscale components of the distribution function is required; (2) only a single unified time-discretization is required; and (3) arbitrary high-order in both space and time can be achieved simply by increasing the spatial polynomial order in each element. Several numerical examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical scheme.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75198' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1528)' class='star'><span class='star1528'>&star;</span></a> Julian Roth  <span id='bitlink-3343'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3343)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3343' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3343)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tensor-Product Space-Time Goal-Oriented Error Control and Adaptivity with Partition-of-Unity Dual-Weighted Residuals for Nonstationary Flow Problems</b><br />Julian Roth<br />Thursday, March 2 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-336.html'>Adaptive Mesh Refinement: Algorithms and Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>In this presentation, the dual-weighted residual method is applied to a space-time formulation of nonstationary Stokes and Navier-Stokes flow.

To estimate the error in a quantity of interest and drive adaptive refinement in time and space, we demonstrate how the dual-weighted residual method for incompressible flow can be extended to a partition of unity based error localization.   We derive the space-time Newton method for the Navier-Stokes equations and   substantiate our methodology on 2D benchmark problems from computational fluid mechanics.

However, porting scientific applications with huge number of code lines is challenging. Data transfers/locality and exposing enough parallelism determine the maximum achievable performance on such systems. Porting efforts impose developers to rewrite parts of the application which is tedious and time-consuming and does not guarantee performances in all the cases. Being able to detect which parts can be expected to deliver performance gains on GPUs is therefore a major asset for developers. Moreover, task parallel programming model is a promising alternative to expose enough parallelism while allowing asynchronous execution between CPU and GPU. OpenMP 4.5 introduces the “target” directive to offload computation on GPU in a portable way. Target constructions are considered as explicit OpenMP task as for CPU but executed on GPU. In this work, we propose a methodology to detect the most profitable loops of an application that can be ported on GPU. While we have applied the detection part on several mini applications (LULESH, miniFE, XSBench and Quicksilver), we experimented the full methodology on LULESH through MPI+OpenMP task programming model with target directives. It relies on runtime modifications to overlap of data transfers and kernel execution through tasks. This work has been integrated into the MPC framework, and has been validated on distributed heterogeneous system.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75318' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(731)' class='star'><span class='star731'>&star;</span></a> Clement W.

Recent interest in machine learning architectures based on differential equations has generated renewed interest for this class of problems. Indeed, it gave rise to several complex optimization formulations where the dynamics play a prominent role and the objective function can be viewed as the result of an expensive procedure, typically not directly available to the optimizer.    
In this talk, we investigate constrained optimization problems where the objective function is the result of a blackbox simulation, but the dynamics expressed in the constraints are available as a white box. We provide an algorithmic framework that is equipped with theoretical guarantees, even when the objective function cannot be accessed directly, and stochastic estimates are available instead. We also illustrate the performance of our algorithm on task involving neural architectures inspired by differential equations.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75456' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1922)' class='star'><span class='star1922'>&star;</span></a> Ezra Rozier  <span id='bitlink-3348'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3348)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3348' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3348)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for 2D Unsteady Convection-Diffusion Problems on Moving Mesh</b><br />Ezra Rozier<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(661)' class='star'><span class='star661'>&star;</span></a> Gianluigi Rozza  <span id='bitlink-3349'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3349)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3349' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3349)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Advances in Model Reduction in Parametric CFD Problems with Machine Learning and Data-Driven Approaches</b><br />Gianluigi Rozza<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-146.html'>Scientific Machine Learning and Data-Driven Techniques in Complex Multi-Physics Systems  - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>We deal with advances in reduced order modelling with a special focus on parametric CFD and applications, currently based on offline-online computing.

Estimation of rheological parameters, for which we start with a Bayesian  formulation, adds substantially to the solver challenges.  To efficiently  estimate parameters in the constitutive relation, we use adjoint Stokes  equations and a Newton method for the resulting PDE-constrained optimization  problem.  The Hessian during the Newton steps is approximated with BFGS, while  a Gauss-Newton Hessian at the numerical minimum is used for quantifying  uncertainties in the estimated parameters.  We demonstrate successful inference  on large cross-sectional models and explore how the inference can be made  computationally feasible at a global scale encompassing the entire Earth.

In [Rueda-Ramírez et al., Subcell Limiting Strategies for DGSEM, 2022], the authors presented subcell limiting strategies for DGSEM discretizations of conservation laws based on the combination of finite volume (FV) schemes with DGSEM. However, the multi-component GLM-MHD equations impose two new challenges: (i) they require the use of non-conservative terms for entropy consistency, which adds complexity to the spatial discretization, and (ii) impose positivity constraints for several ion species.    
Our main contribution is the extension of our hybrid FV/DGSEM to non-conservative systems, which requires to write the DGSEM as a flux-differencing formula. To achieve it, we propose a generalization of the telescoping flux formula of Fisher and Carpenter [Fisher and Carpenter, High-order entropy stable finite difference schemes for nonlinear conservation laws: Finite domains, 2013] to account for non-conservative terms. Furthermore, we show that the hybrid FV/DGSEM can be used to impose invariant domain preserving constraints (including positivity of all ion species).    
We test our new strategy to solve problems featuring shocks and turbulence.

Since data analysis of millions of images is very demanding with respect to computing time and memory requirement, HeAT, the Helmholtz Analytics Toolkit,  is used on a parallel cluster at DLR to reduce the computing time. HeAT is an open source Python library (https://github.com/helmholtz-analytics/heat)   for parallel machine learning.

Based on the lessons learned from the past, current developments and promises are evaluated in order to derive an outlook on where computational science using GPUs is headed.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75757' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1878)' class='star'><span class='star1878'>&star;</span></a> Daniel Ruprecht  <span id='bitlink-3354'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3354)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3354' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3354)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Pseudo-Spectrum of the Parareal Parallel-in-Time Iteration</b><br />Daniel Ruprecht<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(884)' class='star'><span class='star884'>&star;</span></a> Konstantin Rusch  <span id='bitlink-3355'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3355)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3355' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3355)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Physics-Inspired Machine Learning for Sequence Modeling</b><br />Konstantin Rusch<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-193.html'>Deep Learning for Sequence Modeling - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>Combining physics with machine learning is a rapidly growing field of research. Thereby, most work focuses on leveraging machine learning methods to solve problems in physics. Here, however, we focus on the reverse direction of leveraging structure of physical systems (e.g. dynamical systems modeled by ODEs or PDEs) to construct novel machine learning algorithms, where the existence of highly desirable properties of the underlying method can be rigorously proved. In particular, we propose several physics-inspired deep learning architectures for sequence modelling based on coupled oscillators, Hamiltonian systems and multi-scale dynamical systems. The proposed architectures address central problems in the field of recurrent sequence modeling, namely the vanishing and exploding gradients problem as well as the issue of limited expressive power. Finally, we show that this leads to state-of-the-art performance on several widely used benchmark problems ranging from image recognition over speech recognition to NLP applications.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75499' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1020)' class='star'><span class='star1020'>&star;</span></a> Maximilian Ruth  <span id='bitlink-3356'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3356)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3356' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3356)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Level Set Learning for Poincar&#233; Plots of Symplectic Maps</b><br />Maximilian Ruth<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-223.html'>Computational Challenges in Fusion Plasma Confinement</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Many important qualities of plasma confinement devices can be determined via a Poincaré plot of the symplectic magnetic field return map. These qualities include the locations of chaotic regions of phase space and the locations of magnetic islands, which are commonly used for ejecting unwanted particles in the plasma. However, every evaluation of the magnetic return map requires an ODE solve, meaning a detailed Poincaré plot can be expensive to create. In recent years, a variety of symplecticity-preserving neural network based learning methods have been proposed that could be used as proxies to speed up return map evaluations. Unfortunately, these methods still require long training times, and are too expensive to be used for stellarator optimization objectives. In this talk, we propose a kernel-based method where we instead learn a single labeling function that is approximately invariant under the symplectic map. From the labeling function, we show that we can recover important qualities of the Poincaré plot, including the location of stable orbits, islands and chaos. Additionally, the labeling function can be found with relatively few evaluations of the underlying symplectic map, while being robust to error in the symplectic map.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75545' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1284)' class='star'><span class='star1284'>&star;</span></a> Jennifer K.

In practice, the agents often need to impose constraints on the model parameters of the training models for explaining decisions suggested by ML models, promoting fair decisions, and observing some physical laws. For such constrained FL models, we develop an inexact alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm with the objective perturbation method that injects the noise into the loss function for DP. In particular, the perturbation method enables the resulting parameters to satisfy the constraints and the outperformance as compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms based on the output perturbation. We further enhance the training algorithm by reducing the communication costs of multiple local update technique. We show the privacy and convergence analyses of the proposed algorithm for convex constrained FL. Using datasets for image classification, we demonstrate that our algorithm significantly reduces the testing error compared with the existing DP algorithms while achieving the same level of data privacy.

The success of this endeavor must rely upon the combination of sound physically-based models with robust and efficient computational techniques, the final aim being to produce an harmonized representation of mechanistic behavior and data uncertainty. In this lecture, the above vision of Mathematics will be applied to the study of Ophthalmology and Electronics, two branches of Science that, unexpectedly, share analogous microscopic functions and a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Simulations of realistic problems will be illustrated to demonstrate the decisive importance of a cooperative synergy among physics, models and methods in the development of the 21st Century Computational Science.

Many also consider agricultural applications – including plants and animals – to be critical life science applications as well, and, thus, naturally embracing also quantitative ecological and climatic considerations.  Ideas on the type of background valuable for a job search will also be discussed.  One consideration in thinking about this background is that a very broad range of mathematical and computational sciences show up: classical applied math such as differential and partial differential equations, discrete mathematics, visualization, network inference, (stochastic) optimization, control theory, probability, dynamical systems, inverse problems, image processing, pattern recognition/AI, natural language processing, topology, and, of course, numerical analysis and simulation.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75738' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(390)' class='star'><span class='star390'>&star;</span></a> Osamu Saeki  <span id='bitlink-3363'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3363)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3363' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3363)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Generalization of Reeb Spaces and Application to Data Visualization</b><br />Osamu Saeki<br />Thursday, March 2 5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-86.html'>Mathematics for Industry in the Asia Pacific Area - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>In many cases, data sets can be considered to be discrete samples of differentiable maps between manifolds. For a differentiable multivariate function into $\mathbf{R}^p$ with $p \geq 2$, its Reeb space is the space of connected components of its fibers. This is a generalization of the notion of Reeb graphs for univariate functions in the case of $p=1$. It has been known that Reeb spaces are often very useful for visualizing the given multivariate function. In this talk, we generalize the Reeb space in such a way that it captures more of the topological features of the fibers, not only their connected components. This theoretical part essentially relies on the global singularity theory of differentiable maps between manifolds developed mainly by the author. Such techniques have been used for efficiently visualize large scale data.

The use of reinforcement learning techniques relying solely on input-output data has gained popularity in recent years with applications ranging from robotics to portfolio management, control of chaos and stabilization of fluid flows. However, the lack of uncertainty estimates and frequent failures to converge to an optimal control prevent its widespread use in practice.    
Our work focuses on leveraging optimal control theory concepts for Markov decision processes in view of analysis and design of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for the control of spatially distributed systems in an inherently stochastic setting. We use the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as a test case for the stabilization of absolute instability and the control of local convective instability from noisy measurements. Limitations of the framework arising from the lack of observability and controllability and their effect on the convergence to efficient control strategies are discussed.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75487' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1508)' class='star'><span class='star1508'>&star;</span></a> Issam Said  <span id='bitlink-3368'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3368)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3368' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3368)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b> Accelerated Stencil Computations on NVIDIA H100</b><br />Issam Said<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-332.html'>Stencil Computation for Scientific Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>GPUs are very popular to compute 3D finite difference stencils.   Compared to naive implementations, optimized Stencil kernels can provide a significant speedup.    
Paulius Micikevicius described an optimized implementation on early CUDA GPUs using a mix of register queues and shared memory. Although the method described still apply today, we can apply a few modifications to keep these stencil codes running as fast as possible on the latest architectures.    
Today's GPUs are significantly more powerful than the NVIDIA Tesla S1070 used in the original paper.    
The number of compute cores has grown significantly, Tensor Cores are available to accelerate GEMMs, the memory bandwidth numbers have improved by an order of magnitude with the adoption of HBM, the L2 caches are now significantly larger, and newer instructions have been introduced to help move data in and out of the symmetrical multiprocessor (SM) units more efficiently.    
The memory bandwidth has also grown significantly, and is often the main bottleneck for these problems.    
Finite difference stencil codes are typically bandwidth-bound, and the goal for stencil codes should be to move the minimum amount of data, at speeds as close as possible to the theoretical peak bandwidth.     
In this talk we suggest a new method of Stencil Computation with some experimentation on the latest NVIDIA GPU, H100.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75737' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1725)' class='star'><span class='star1725'>&star;</span></a> Thomas Saigre  <span id='bitlink-3369'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3369)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3369' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3369)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Model Order Reduction for Complex Ocular Simulations Inside the Human Eyeball</b><br />Thomas Saigre<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-123.html'>Advances in the Multiscale and Multiphysics Modeling of Biological Fluids: Theoretical and Numerical Aspects - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>Complex ocular simulations are devoted to modeling the interplay between tissue perfusion, biomechanics, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer within the eye.  These different aspects of the same physical problem have to be properly connected and every step has to be verified and validated in the interest of a medical application.  The models require the knowledge of various parameters and some may be important factors in the development of pathologies.  However, despite recent significant advances in medical data acquisition, only some parameters and their variability are known, but others cannot be directly measured.   To identify the main factors that influence the biomechanical behavior of the eye, we, therefore, need to study the influence of these parameters through an uncertainty quantification (UQ) process which requires many evaluations of the models.  Since 3D models are not amenable directly to UQ, a reduction step is needed to mitigate the computational cost.    
We previously conducted a complete UQ analysis on a 0D reduced model.  In the present talk, we propose a strategy to carry out further analysis using reduced order methods and in particular the reduced basis method.  We present the application of these methods in the context of both continuous Galerkin and Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin formulations.  We discuss then the implementation with the library Feel++.

Since the amount of measurement data is limited, not only a optimal parameter fit is needed, but also an estimate on the uncertainty of this optimal fit.  In this talk, we study the use of  multlilevel Monte Carlo methods to sample the posterior parameter distribution of a Mitchell-Schaeffer model for cardiac arrhythmia.  To validate the computational procedure, we will work synthetic data, simulated via the same model,   to which we will add measurement noise with different sizes and covariance structures. The goal is to  recover the (spatially homogeneous) model parameters that were used to generate the data, and to assess the importance of the size and the correct quantification of measurement noise. To measure  similarity between measurement data and model output, we use the LAT as a summary statistic, effectively resorting to an Approximate Bayesian Computation. Since PDE models for biological systems typically contain lots of modeling error, we also study the effect of model error on the posterior distribution.

Across sensory and motor regions of the brain, neural circuits are found to mirror the group transformation structure of the systems they represent—either in their synaptic structure, or in the implicit manifold generated by their activity. This phenomenon can be observed in the circuit of neurons representing head direction in the fly (S1), in the activities of grid cells for spatial navigation (T2), and even in the physical structure of the ear’s semi-circular canals for the vestibular sense (SO(3)). These findings suggest a general computational strategy that is employed throughout the brain to preserve the group structure of data throughout stages of information processing. However, to discover phenomena beyond these relatively simple and well-understood circuits, we will need methods capable of discovering unknown group structure in data—an approach I call group learning. In this talk, I present Bispectral Neural Networks for group learning and demonstrate the potential of this approach an algebraic alternative to topological data analysis or manifold learning in the neuroscience toolkit.

It was discovered recently that  axisymmetric periodic regimes can also be preferred at low Prandtl, Pr, and Ekman, Ek, numbers. These flows are known as torsional.    
In order to determine the parameter-space region where the  axisymmetric flows are the first bifurcated solutions from the  conduction state, the curves of double Hopf points corresponding to  simultaneous transitions to azimuthal wave numbers $(m_1,m_2)=(0,1)$,  (1,1), (0,2), etc. were computed. These curves form the skeleton of  the bifurcation diagram, separating the regions of different preferred  azimuthal wave numbers. Their intersections are triple Hopf points,  several of which were found. It turned out that the region of interest  was limited by the curves $(m_1,m_2)=(0,1)$ and (0,2).    
The torsional solutions emerging form the conduction state were  computed for several pairs (Pr,Ek) inside the above mentioned region,  and their stability to azimuthal dependence was studied using Floquet  multipliers.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75445' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1323)' class='star'><span class='star1323'>&star;</span></a> Antonio Sanchez  <span id='bitlink-3377'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3377)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3377' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3377)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Eigen: System Overview, Maintenance Challenges, and Lessons Learned</b><br />Antonio Sanchez<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-291.html'>Recent Advances in Numerical Linear Algebra Programming and Libraries - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Eigen is an open-source C++ template library for linear algebra, supporting matrix and tensor operations, geometric transforms, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.

In fluid flow problems, this problem is usually known as the “closure problem”, and the art is to discover a “closure model” that represents the effect of the small scales on the large scales. Well-known examples appear in large eddy simulations (LES) and in reduced-order models (ROMs). Recently, it appeared that highly accurate closure models can be constructed by using neural networks. However, integrating the neural network into the physics models (“neural closure models”) is typically prone to numerical instabilities as the training environment does not match the prediction environment. Instead, we investigate learning closure models while they are embedded in a discretized PDE solver by using differentiable programming software. This "trajectory fitting" or "embedded learning" approach is a more difficult learning problem than the more classical approach of operator fitting, but promises better accuracy and stability. We compare two strategies to solve the trajectory fitting problem: discretise-then-optimise and optimise-then-discretise. Furthermore, we present a new neural closure model form which allows us to preserve structure, namely kinetic energy conservation, and therefore non-linear stability bounds.

Then, the usual Lorentz force for the particles is expressed in terms of these wave potentials and their spatial derivatives through the use of generalized momentum. A new BDF wave solver is presented for the solution of these equations for the potentials that induces a discrete equivalence between the Lorenz gauge condition and the continuity equation. We also discuss the new methods used to construct the spatial derivatives required in the update for particles, which are inspired by the wave solver used to evolve the potentials. Numerical results will be presented to demonstrate the application of the new method.

Numerical simulations are commonly used to understand the mechanism of bell propulsion and the resulting fluid dynamics. These simulations use simplified jellyfish models, typically only simulating the jellyfish bell and neglecting the oral arms. However, a blue blubber jellyfish’s oral arms are prominent; together, the oral arms are close to the diameter of the jelly bell. Neglecting the oral arms would result in overly idealized fluid dynamics, not considering the vortex shedding from the bell interacting with passive elastic structures. This work uses the immersed boundary finite element (IBFE) method to simulate a fully 3D swimming blue blubber jellyfish, including the oral arms. Additionally, swimming is driven using a muscle model rather than with prescribed motion, allowing for emergent behavior. The work is implemented in IBAMR, an adaptive, parallelizable implementation of the immersed boundary method with IBFE capabilities. The methodology and modeling will be discussed in addition to the challenges and need for improved methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75811' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1714)' class='star'><span class='star1714'>&star;</span></a> Gabriele Santin  <span id='bitlink-3382'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3382)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3382' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3382)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Probabilistic Sampling for High Dimensional Kernel Based Approximation</b><br />Gabriele Santin<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-379.html'>High-Fidelity and Data-Driven Methods for Multiscale and Multi-Physics Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Kernel based algorithm can be formulated in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, where functional analytical results can be used to provide guarantees on the performances of the algorithm.

The computational resources and time required to generate these simulations can be so large and impractical. With several successes of generative models, we propose a new method in which generative neural networks within a reduced-order model (ROM) framework are used for prediction, data assimilation and uncertainty quantification. A method has been developed which enables a generative network to perform time series prediction and data assimilation by training it with unconditional simulations of a discretized partial differential equation (PDE) model. After training, the generative model can be used to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of the physical states and observed data can be assimilated. We also describe the process required in order to quantify uncertainty, during which no additional simulations of the high-fidelity numerical PDE model are required. These methods work in the latent space (reduced space), which improves efficiency, also they take advantage of the adjoint-like capabilities of neural networks and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. The results show that the proposed Generative Network-Based ROM can efficiently quantify uncertainty and accurately match the observed data, using only few unconditional simulations of the high-fidelity numerical PDE model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75430' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(18)' class='star'><span class='star18'>&star;</span></a> Sean P.

The long-term behavior of a system governed by the SCE is predictable, but trajectories can have a significant temporary sensitivity to initial conditions. In atmosphere models, this corresponds to uncertainty about when the system starts to produce a significant number of "rain-sized" drops.    
Such models can use "bin" microphysics schemes, which discretize the drop size distribution, to solve equations such as the SCE numerically. However, most models use cheaper "bulk" microphysics schemes, which describe the population of drops using only a few variables, e.g. total mass and number. These bulk schemes are reduced order models for microphysical systems, but the strong nonlinearity of the SCE makes conventional reduced order modeling techniques difficult to apply.    
We present a new method, Jacobian Estimation of Functional Error (JEFE), which uses an adjoint model to measure the predictability of bin model outputs from a small set of prognostic variables. This allows us to identify whether the given variables provide enough information to capture the system's dynamics, a prerequisite for an effective bulk scheme. Having chosen a set of variables, we can then produce a bulk scheme using data-driven methods, such as the Bayesian Observationally constrained Statistical-physical Scheme (BOSS).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75183' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1156)' class='star'><span class='star1156'>&star;</span></a> Daniel Sanz-Alonso  <span id='bitlink-3387'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3387)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3387' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3387)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Auto-Differentiable Ensemble Kalman Filters</b><br />Daniel Sanz-Alonso<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-254.html'>Blending Learning and Dynamical Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>Data assimilation is concerned with sequentially estimating a temporally-evolving state. This task, which arises in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, is particularly challenging when the state is high-dimensional and the state-space dynamics are unknown. In this talk I will introduce a machine learning framework for learning dynamical systems in data assimilation. Our auto-differentiable ensemble Kalman filters (AD-EnKFs) blend ensemble Kalman filters for state recovery with machine learning tools for learning the dynamics. In doing so, AD-EnKFs leverage the ability of ensemble Kalman filters to scale to high-dimensional states and the power of automatic differentiation to train high-dimensional surrogate models for the dynamics. Numerical results using the Lorenz-96 model show that AD-EnKFs outperform existing methods that use expectation-maximization or particle filters to merge data assimilation and machine learning. In addition, AD-EnKFs are easy to implement and require minimal tuning.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75580' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(512)' class='star'><span class='star512'>&star;</span></a> Piyush Sao  <span id='bitlink-3388'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3388)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3388' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3388)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Communication-Avoiding Algorithms for Sparse Triangular Matrices</b><br />Piyush Sao<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-112.html'>Sparse Computations in Science and Engineering - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Sparse triangular matrices occur extensively in scientific computing and data-intensive applications, most notably for solving systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination. Such matrices have emerged as essential tools for artificial intelligence applications as they effectively model certain kinds of uni-directional information flow, such as the kind that occurs within feed-forward and graph neural networks or neuromorphic hardware. In this talk, I will discuss how we can exploit structured sparsity to reduce data transfer in parallel computation. Specifically, I will discuss new communication-avoiding algorithms for solving sparse triangular equations systems, which illustrate the more general idea of path decomposition and duplication — two techniques that facilitate performing sparse triangular computation with reduced communication. The path-duplication technique, while generalizing traditional edge duplication-based methods like 3D matrix multiplication and ghost cells in stencil computation for reducing communication, also shows some differences that may be useful for broader sparse linear algebraic and graph computations and beyond.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75388' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(318)' class='star'><span class='star318'>&star;</span></a> Khachik Sargsyan  <span id='bitlink-3389'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3389)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3389' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3389)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Model Error Estimation for Active Learning of Interatomic Potential Models</b><br />Khachik Sargsyan<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-70.html'>Model Error-Aware Methods for Inverse Problems and Experimental Design</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>Solutions to inverse problems often assume the computational model can replicate the true mechanism behind data generation. However,  physical models carry misspecification due to different parameterizations and assumptions. Ignoring such model errors can lead to overconfident calibrations and poor predictive capability, even when high-quality data are used. As a result, outer-loop tasks, such as active learning or optimal design lead to biased results with poorly calibrated uncertainties.    
This work will present a Bayesian inference framework for representing, quantifying, and propagating uncertainties due to model structural errors by embedding stochastic correction terms in the model. The physical input parameters and model-error parameters are then simultaneously optimized in an inverse modeling context.     
We will demonstrate the methodology on example problems developing machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIAP) models. The resulting predictive uncertainties capture model error and will be employed in an active learning loop to enable efficient construction of uncertainty-augmented MLIAPs.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75317' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1745)' class='star'><span class='star1745'>&star;</span></a> Clement Sarrazin  <span id='bitlink-3390'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3390)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3390' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3390)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Linearized Optimal Transport and Applications</b><br />Clement Sarrazin<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-384.html'>Inverse Optimal Transport - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75852' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1984)' class='star'><span class='star1984'>&star;</span></a> Ibrahim O.

In this talk, we discuss a framework for the development of exponential time differencing schemes for solving such systems. In particular, we present robust first, second, and third order accurate schemes.   Rather than imposing regularity requirements on the solution to account for the singularity caused by the fractional derivative, we only consider regularity requirements on the source term for preserving the optimal order of accuracy of the proposed schemes.  Optimal convergence rates are proved for both smooth and nonsmooth source terms using uniform and graded meshes, respectively.  For efficient implementation, high-order global Pad\'e approximations together with  their partial fraction decompositions are developed for Mittag-Leffler functions.   Numerical experiments involving a typical stiff system, and   other large systems obtained by spatial discretization of a sub-diffusion problem are typical examples to be discussed.  Demonstration of the efficiency of the rational approximation implementation technique and the constructed high-order schemes are to be illustrated.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77155' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1548)' class='star'><span class='star1548'>&star;</span></a> Bonita V.

Usually, the design development is divided  into two different phases. The first phase is to determine the pre-optimal design. Through the use of numerical software, the best design is chosen considering some ideal performances to be achieved.  The second phase is to certify through full-scale experiments that the design determined previously is valid. In this way, the post-optimal design is specified. This second phase is the most costly one. In that respect, manufacturers seek to lower the utilization of full-scale experiments. Optimal Uncertainty Quantification (OUQ) is a powerful mathematical tool which can be used to rigorously bound the probability of exceeding a given performance threshold for uncertain operational conditions or system  characteristics. This mathematical framework can be very computationally demanding. The use of a metamodel is highly desirable. Moreover, the robustness of the bounding obtained in this framework will strongly depend on the quality of this metamodel. Therefore, one needs to build a metamodel which is quick to evaluate and as accurate as possible. An algorithm, named Spectral Kernel Ridge Regression, is introduced to design kernels from available data in Gaussian process regression surrogate modeling techniques. This algorithm is illustrated on several numerical examples.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75505' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(521)' class='star'><span class='star521'>&star;</span></a> Taraneh Sayadi  <span id='bitlink-3395'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3395)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3395' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3395)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data-Driven Reduction of Chemical Input-Output Libraries in Simulations of Hypersonic Flows in Non-Equilibrium</b><br />Taraneh Sayadi<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-114.html'>Reduced-Complexity Models for Fluid Flows - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Hypersonic flows are of great interest in a wide range of aerospace applications and are a critical component of many technological advances. Accurate simulations of these flows in thermodynamic (non)-equilibrium (accounting for high temperature effects) rely on detailed thermochemical gas models. While accurately capturing the underlying aerothermochemistry, these models dramatically increase the cost of such calculations. In this paper, we present a novel model-agnostic machine-learning technique to extract a reduced thermochemical model of a gas mixture from a library. A first simulation gathers all relevant thermodynamic states and the corresponding gas properties via a given model. The states are embedded in a low-dimensional space and clustered to identify regions with different levels of thermochemical (non)-equilibrium. Then, a surrogate surface from the reduced cluster-space to the output space is generated using radial-basis-function networks.  The method is validated and benchmarked on a simulation of a hypersonic flat-plate boundary layer with finite-rate chemistry. The gas properties of the reactive air mixture are initially modeled using an open-source library. Substituting the library with the light-weight, machine-learned alternative improves the performance of the solver by 50% while maintaining overall accuracy.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75390' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(407)' class='star'><span class='star407'>&star;</span></a> Kevin Scaman  <span id='bitlink-3396'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3396)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3396' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3396)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Non-Convex Stochastic Gradient Descent</b><br />Kevin Scaman<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-90.html'>Acceleration Methods for Scientific and Machine Learning Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75359' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(621)' class='star'><span class='star621'>&star;</span></a> Laura Scarabosio  <span id='bitlink-3397'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3397)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3397' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3397)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Modeling and Bayesian Calibration for Tumour Cell Dynamics Under Different Environmental Conditions</b><br />Laura Scarabosio<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-136.html'>Statistical Inverse Problems: Theory and Computation - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>The dynamics of cancer cells is strongly affected by the microenvironment surrounding the tumour.

In the context of model error, different choices of misfit measures can play a crucial role in mitigating or magnifying the impact of the misspecification. This is particularly important in inverse problems, such as those in full waveform inversion, where the misfit should measure data features that are most relevant for learning the unknown parameters. For various statistical models appearing in supervised learning and inverse problems, we show that specific choices of optimal-transport-based misfit functions can reduce the gap between model space and the observed data. For both deterministic and Bayesian inference problems, we compare the recovered solution to traditional discrepancy measures based on the $\ell_2$ norm. A variety of independent scoring rules that account for different predictive goals are used to quantify the error of the recovered solution in both state and data space for these inverse problems.

Specifically the quantum computers capability to work in a space that is exponentially large with the respect of quantum bits available, can lead to some exciting speed ups when properly exploited.     
In the field of computational fluid dynamics the prospect of working with an exponentially large storage space is particularly interesting, but currently little research is being done on this topic as it cannot yet be realised on today's Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers.    
In this presentation we introduce a novel start-to-end quantum algorithms for the efficient simulation of the collisionless lattice Boltzmann equation on universal quantum computers. Our approach supersedes earlier work in this direction both in its computational efficiency and its ability to handle all types of flow configurations. We verify the correct functioning of our approach and its true quantum-readiness by providing a reference start-to-end implementation in Qiskit and presenting numerical results for difference benchmark computations.

Our work improves upon a multi-dimensional, parallelized domain decomposition (DDC) strategy for mass-transfer particle tracking (MTPT) methods. We show that this can be efficiently parallelized by employing large numbers of CPU cores to accelerate run times. Current, static DDC methods fix each processor's area of responsibility for the duration of the simulation and provide ample speedup when particle density is approximately constant throughout the domain. However, this type of DDC does not guarantee proper load balance in simulations with, say, a highly heterogeneous velocity field. Our algorithm relies on particles that move within each time step, and their corresponding information must be manually moved between processors when necessary. In this work, we investigate and compare two different procedures for dynamically decomposing the domain to address work imbalance amongst processors---one being a moving geometric DDC and the other being a tree-based neighbor search. In theory, each method presents advantages over the other, which prompted this study for the method we should use moving forward. Both new techniques provide significant speedup over their serial versions, and we observe further advantages than their parallelized predecessors.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75875' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(625)' class='star'><span class='star625'>&star;</span></a> Robert Scheichl  <span id='bitlink-3406'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3406)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3406' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3406)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Bayesian Approach to Modelling Biological Pattern Formation with Limited Data</b><br />Robert Scheichl<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-137.html'>Statistical Inverse Problems: Theory and Computation - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Pattern formation plays an important role in the development of living organisms. Since the classical work of Alan Turing, a pre-eminent way of modelling has been through reaction-diffusion mechanisms. Alternative models have been proposed, that link dynamics of diffusing molecular signals with tissue mechanics. Model validation is complicated as in many experimental situations only the limiting, stationary regime of the pattern formation process is observable, without any knowledge of the transient behaviour or the initial state. To overcome this problem, the initial state of the model can be randomised. But then fixed values of the model parameters correspond to a family of patterns rather than a fixed stationary solution, and standard estimation approaches, such as the least squares method, are not suitable. Instead, statistical characteristics of the patterns should be compared, which is difficult given the typically limited amount of available data in practical applications. To deal with this problem, we extend the recently developed statistical approach (the Correlation Integral Likelihood method) for parameter identification by pattern data. We introduce modifications that allow increasing the accuracy of the identification process without resizing the data set. The proposed approach is tested using different classes of pattern formation models and severely limited data sets.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75425' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(989)' class='star'><span class='star989'>&star;</span></a> Bj&#246;rn Schembera  <span id='bitlink-3407'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3407)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3407' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3407)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>From Dark Data to Fair Data in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics</b><br />Bj&#246;rn Schembera<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-216.html'>Interfaces, Workflows, and Knowledge Graphs for FAIR CSE - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Dark data are data that are poorly managed and they are becoming a major problem for science and industry. They are diametrically opposed to FAIR data because their epistemic status is unclear, and they are neither findable, accessible, interoperable, nor reusable. As such, research data may be uncurated, unavailable, unannotated, biased, or incomplete. The talk will explore representative examples of dark data in the fields of scientific computing and in statistics.  Dark data as a negative category serve well as an analytical tool to work out how the data management processes can be improved and aligned with the FAIR principles with respect to  reproducible research. This can be enabled by documenting epistemic metadata, i.e., information about the knowledge status of data. Epistemic metadata include, besides documenting pure process metadata, also the reflection and integration of scientific underpinnings of the research. This in turn means the evaluation of disciplinary scientific practices and conventions in detail. It is here that NFDI consortia, such as the Mathematical Research Data Initiative (MaRDI), can provide dedicated support by encouraging academic communities to engage in community-driven metadata standardization. In case of mathematics this means setting up semantic technology (metadata, ontologies, knowledge graphs) for problems, models, algorithms and software. The effort will be highlighted in the talk.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75530' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1360)' class='star'><span class='star1360'>&star;</span></a> Daniel Schemmel  <span id='bitlink-3408'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3408)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3408' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3408)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Constrained-Based Testing for Floating-Point Code: Challenges and Opportunities</b><br />Daniel Schemmel<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-300.html'>Bridging the Gap from HPC Software Engineering to Academic Research</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>Computational science code makes intense use of floating-point numbers.

A promising approach in that direction is to jointly factorize data sets from multiple sources using coupled matrix and tensor factorizations. The PARAFAC2 model for tensor decompositions has been shown to be a promising alternative to the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model for temporal data due to its capability of capturing time-evolving patterns. While there have been studies using a PARAFAC2 model coupled with a matrix decomposition for joint analysis of dynamic and static data, they rely on implicit estimation of the evolving mode or a flexible PARAFAC2 constraint, and are therefore limited in terms of possible regularizations on the evolving mode. In this talk, we present a flexible algorithmic framework for joint factorization of dynamic and static data based on the PARAFAC2 model. It allows the PARAFAC2 model to be coupled to a matrix or a CP decomposition in any static mode.  The algorithmic framework utilizes Alternating Optimization with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers and facilitates the use of linear couplings and many different constraints on all modes, including the evolving mode in the PARAFAC2 model. In our framework, we allow for any proximable constraint, thus also enabling the use of time-aware constraints on the evolving mode.

The interplay of phase behavior, fluid dynamics, and interfacial thermodynamics in complex fluids gives rise to interesting structure-property relations such as interfacial assembly and kinetically arrested phase morphologies. One particular example of kinetically arrested liquid mixtures are interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) that emerge due to colloidal jamming during spinodal decomposition, resulting in an out-of-equilibrium liquid morphology with gel-like properties.    
Computational modeling and simulations can help gain a fundamental understanding of the structure and dynamics of particle-stabilized emulsions. In this talk, I will present results from lattice Boltzmann simulations of binary fluid mixtures with anisotropic suspended particles. Magnetic particles can be used for controlled deformation and coalescence of particle-stabilized droplets by applied fields. I will further present simulations of bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels. The simulations shed light on the effect of magnetic fields on the domain size and morphology of liquid mesophases. Potential applications include the development of control mechanisms that enable design of fluid templates with tailored structure, which can be leveraged to fabricate porous membranes and fibers for filtration and separation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75539' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(567)' class='star'><span class='star567'>&star;</span></a> Christian Schilling  <span id='bitlink-3414'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3414)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3414' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3414)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reachability of Weakly Nonlinear Systems Using Carleman Linearization</b><br />Christian Schilling<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-125.html'>Exact Polynomialization and Quadratization of Nonlinear Dynamics - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>In this presentation we introduce a solution method for a special class of quadratic initial-value problems using set-propagation techniques.

One potentially relevant approach is a Flettner rotor, i.e. a rotating cylinder that uses the Magnus effect to generate lift. While Flettner rotors have been considered in experiments and RANS simulations, no direct numerical simulation (DNS) ofa Flettner rotor, focusing on the interaction with the surrounding turbulent boundary layer has been carried out. Our simulation demonstrates our new CFD code Neko, a solver that owes its homage to Nek5000. Neko is based on similar numerical methods, but differs in that it also accommodates modern computer architectures such as GPUs and has an object-oriented codebase written in modern Fortran. Special emphasis has been put on portability, scalability and the possibility to extend to code easily with new features; thereby keeping the complexity for the domain scientist to a minimum. The flow case under consideration is a Flettner rotor submerged in a turbulent boundary layer, consisting of 1M spectral elements, which turns into 0.5B unique grid points. We discuss the strong scaling efficiency with comparing several architectures, including latest GPUs. We observe excellent parallel scaling, up to hundreds of nodes. Our initial findings for the lift are in excellent agreement with experimental data. We further observe that there is a strong interaction between the rotor and the turbulent boundary layer, in terms of modified coherent structures.

As a key new contribution, we propose to construct these ansatz functions in an embarrassingly parallel and local manner in time by selecting important points in time and only performing local computations on the corresponding local time intervals.    
In detail, we perform several simulations of the PDE for only few time steps in parallel, starting at different, randomly drawn start time points, prescribing random initial conditions. Applying a singular value decomposition to a subset of the so obtained snapshots yields the reduced ansatz functions. To select suitable start points in time, we suggest using data-driven sampling strategies from randomized numerical linear algebra such as leverage score sampling. By solving the PDE locally in time with random initial conditions, we construct local ansatz spaces in time that converge provably at a quasi-optimal rate and allow for local error control.     
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform existing methods like the proper orthogonal decomposition even in a sequential setting and is well capable of approximating advection-dominated problems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75797' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(260)' class='star'><span class='star260'>&star;</span></a> Matthias Schlottbom  <span id='bitlink-3417'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3417)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3417' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3417)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On Low-Rank Tensor Product Approximations for the Stationary Radiative Transfer Equation</b><br />Matthias Schlottbom<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-57.html'>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>In this talk we are going to present a low-rank tensor product framework for the approximation of the stationary radiative transfer equation. Classical numerical schemes in radiative transfer, such as truncated spherical harmonics expansions combined with finite element approximations, are based on the tensor product structure of the underlying phase-space. While the tensor product structure allows to efficiently store the discretization of the differential operator, storage of the solution vector and its numerical computation becomes prohibitive already for moderately refined meshes - even if solvers with optimal computational complexity are employed.  In this talk, we present an efficient computational approach that is based on a low-rank tensor product representation of the solution vector. Based on an appropriate variational formulation, we approximate the radiative transfer equation using a Galerkin method, for which the discrete differential operator is a short-sum of Kronecker products. In such a setting, the application of the discrete differential operator to low-rank tensors can be realized efficiently. Based on this observation, we discuss the iterative construction of a low-rank approximation to the solution vector by a preconditioned Richardson iteration with rank control, which has previously been used in the context of high-dimensional elliptic equations. A key feature of our approach is the construction of a suitable preconditioner that can be applied efficiently to low-rank tensor. As an important consequence, we can devise a rank truncation strategy in the norm of the Hilbert space of the underlying variational formulation.

In this talk, we will discuss how the Julia programming language can help to overcome some of the typical challenges that arise when trying to develop a high-performance research code that can be easily used and extended by other scientists. We will demonstrate how Trixi.jl, an adaptive high-order numerical simulation package for conservation laws, was designed as a software library with modular components, but with the necessary infrastructure code to make it usable as a standalone framework. The code extensibility afforded by the multiple dispatch mechanism of the Julia language is leveraged to attain high-performance implementations without having to sacrifice accessibility for new users. Finally, we will show how the seamless interoperability with C libraries allows us to scale our Julia code to thousands of cores.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75232' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(16)' class='star'><span class='star16'>&star;</span></a> Michael J.

However, aerosol microphysical processes, chemistry, and transport properties are not yet fully understood and are highly parameterized, leading to uncertainty in the results of our models. Thus, we must obtain accurate aerosol models that are also predictive, particularly in a time when aerosol-emitting ships may soon traverse the polar arctic ocean and there is credible talk about climate intervention strategies like stratospheric aerosol injection. This work focuses on the transport properties of atmospheric aerosols, namely their mixing and spreading via turbulent transport in the planetary boundary layer. We propose a novel stochastic model comprised of advection and diffusion parameters, operating on distinct spatial scales, that vary according to their respective machine-learned probability distribution, parameterized to be a function of space, time, and relevant exogenic properties. The model is evaluated using ensembles of particles that advect and diffuse both deterministically and via random walks with a magnitude drawn from the corresponding learned distribution. To verify our model, we employ data sources varying across a wide range of scales from algorithmically-classified satellite imagery of ship-exhaust tracks in the Pacific to a tabletop fog chamber.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75182' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1601)' class='star'><span class='star1601'>&star;</span></a> Stephan Schmidt  <span id='bitlink-3420'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3420)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3420' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3420)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Shape Optimization Using Material Derivative Shape Hessians</b><br />Stephan Schmidt<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-354.html'>New Developments in Shape, Topology and Tubular Optimization - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>A variational approach for higher order shape optimization based on the distributed formulation of the shape derivative is considered. Within this approach, the adjoint is used to eliminate material derivatives instead of partial derivatives, which leads to a very convenient way to derive a Newton scheme for shape optimization. In particular, this approach also allows an interpretation of the Sobolev gradient descent methods as an approximation of the shape Hessian when the perimeter is used as a regularizer.    
The methodology quite naturally leads to a variational formulation to compute the 2nd order shape updates and opens the door to novel numerical schemes, not only in classical aerodynamic shape optimization, but also to construct particularly fast solvers for free surface flows and microfluids.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75781' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(885)' class='star'><span class='star885'>&star;</span></a> Philipp Schmocker  <span id='bitlink-3421'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3421)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3421' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3421)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Universal Approximation of Random Neural Networks</b><br />Philipp Schmocker<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-193.html'>Deep Learning for Sequence Modeling - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>In this paper, we study single-layer feedforward neural networks with randomly initialized weight matrices and bias vectors, which is inspired by the works on extreme learning machines, random feature models, and reservoir computing.

Despite the popularity of this approach in empirical tasks, only little is known about the approximation capabilities of such networks. By considering these so-called &#8220;random neural networks' as Banach space-valued random variables, we provide several universal approximation theorems within the underlying Bochner space. Moreover, we extend the results to more general function spaces such as $L^p$-spaces and also consider the simultaneous approximation including the derivatives, which can be used for the approximation in Sobolev spaces.

Numerical approximations that mirror this property are said to be asymptotic preserving.  In this paper we build two discontinuous Galerkin methods to the semiconductor model: one with the standard upwinding flux and the other with a $\varepsilon$-scaled Lax-Friedrichs flux, where 1/$\varepsilon$ is the scale of the collision frequency.  We show that these schemes are uniformly stable in $\varepsilon$ and are asymptotic preserving.  In particular, we discuss what properties the discrete Maxwellian must satisfy in order for the schemes to converge in $\varepsilon$ to an accurate $h$-approximation of the drift diffusion limit.  Discrete versions of the drift-diffusion equation and error estimates in several norms with respect to $\varepsilon$ and the spacial resolution are also included.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75513' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(990)' class='star'><span class='star990'>&star;</span></a> David Schneider  <span id='bitlink-3423'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3423)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3423' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3423)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Offering General Purpose Applications in Scientific Communities</b><br />David Schneider<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-217.html'>Interfaces, Workflows, and Knowledge Graphs for FAIR CSE - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Software interfaces are a central aspect when it comes to the usability of simulation frameworks. The coupling library preCICE is a general purpose software framework, which couples simulation software stemming from different physical domains in order to simulate a global system behavior using the coupled solvers.  This talk deals with the inherent challenges arising due to the complexity of coupling different software interfaces employing different concepts as provided by each simulation software. A key aspect to cope with this complexity was the development of software-tailored adapter codes that bridge the gap between preCICE and the coupled application code. Nowadays, the preCICE ecosystem comprises several such adapter codes, corresponding tutorials as well as a broad documentation for each component. The variety of ready-to-use infrastructure in the preCICE ecosystem is one of the main reasons for a steadily growing and vibrant user community.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75531' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(800)' class='star'><span class='star800'>&star;</span></a> Henrik Schneider  <span id='bitlink-3424'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3424)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3424' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3424)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Meshing Strategies for Sea-Ice Simulation</b><br />Henrik Schneider<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-175.html'>Reliable and Efficient Methods for Coupled Problems in Porous Media - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>A very influential simplification of the general governing equation of   sea-ice behaviour is the so-called dynamical sea-ice model by   Hibler. This model has been intensively discussed in the  last half-century and is used in many climate models. Many models   use finite-difference methods to approximate the model equations  and therefore are restricted to quadrilateral meshes. Therefore   in recent years, there was some development to use finite-element   methods for this kind of simulation. This approach   allows the use of more general meshes, in particular  triangular meshes.     
We want to extend this development to the next   step. We present an a posteriori error estimator,  which allows us to derive an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm.   This is particularly useful for saving computing power and   guarantees good approximation in cases of low regularity   solutions. This is especially useful for higher order methods  which accelerate the convergence.

Matrix-free high order finite element discretizations, preconditioners, or explicit time stepping methods can be expressed by the composition of matrices of various types.  Since in many cases it is cheap, the operators are built on the host system, and the whole tree of matrices is moved to the accelerator. As a case study we consider symplectic time stepping methods for Maxell equations discretized by high order cell methods. The matrices from the differential operators are universal for all elements, and mass matrices are block-diagonal with very small, order independent block sizes. Time domain PML leads to coupled ordinary differential equations, which can all be expressed by operator composition.  We present our in-house cuda-based implementation to dispatch the operator tree to GPUs, but similar concepts are portable to other popular linear algebra libraries.

These include energy balances and numerical solutions for instationary flow.    
Shallow flow models are of high practical relevance, however, in certain situations they reach their limits. Due to an averaging process, information on the vertical profile of the flow variables is generally lost. This paper presents a framework for the systematic derivation of dimensionally reduced dispersive equation systems that hold information on the vertical profiles of the flow variables. The derivation from a set of balance laws is based on a splitting of the pressure followed by a same-degree polynomial expansion of the velocity and pressure fields in vertical direction. Dimensional reduction is done via Galerkin projections with weak enforcement of the boundary conditions at the bottom and at the free surface. The resulting equation systems of order zero and one are presented in linear and nonlinear form for Legendre basis functions and an analysis of dispersive properties is given. A numerical experiment shows convergence towards the resolved reference model in the linear stationary case and demonstrates the reconstruction of vertical profiles.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75509' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(257)' class='star'><span class='star257'>&star;</span></a> Steffen Schotth&#246;fer  <span id='bitlink-3427'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3427)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3427' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3427)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Regularized, Structure Preserving, Neural Network Based Entropy Closures for the Boltzmann Moment System</b><br />Steffen Schotth&#246;fer<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-56.html'>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>The main challenge of large scale numerical simulation of radiation transport is the high memory and computation time requirements of discretization methods for the Boltzmann equation.

We extend structure preserving, neural network based approximations of the closure of the moment system to the context of regularized entropy closures. The main idea is to interpret structure preserving neural network approximations of  the regularized entropy closure as an two stage approximation to the original entropy closure. We conduct numerical analysis of this approximation and investigate optimal parameter choices. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the method has a much lower memory footprint than traditional methods with competitive computation times and simulation accuracy.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75290' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(79)' class='star'><span class='star79'>&star;</span></a> Stefan Schrammer  <span id='bitlink-3428'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3428)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3428' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3428)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation for Second-Order Matrix Differential Equations</b><br />Stefan Schrammer<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-17.html'>Low-Rank Approximation for Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we introduce a new dynamical low-rank integrator for second-order matrix differential equations

While classic Bayesian Optimization is iteratively updating the surrogate model of the black-box function according to the acquisition function Expected Improvement,  PMBO delivers a black-box model by fitting a polynomial surrogate to the objective function that enables fast optimization of the surrogate. Though due to the “No Free Lunch Theorem” there is no universal best optimizer, by benchmarking PMBO  against other state-of-the-art algorithms for a set of artificial, analytical functions and a biological Tumor Response Model, its performance results to be superior up to dimension 6.

From a pure computing perspective, algorithms are required to cope with stagnating or even decreasing per-core speed and increasing on-chip parallelism. These and other showstopping trends will continue and already led to research on partly disruptive mathematical and algorithmic reformulations of dynamic cores, e.g., using (additional) parallelism along the time dimension.    
This presentation provides an overview and introduction of a selection of the following promising newly developed and evaluated time integration methods for equations related to prototypical dynamical cores, all aimed at improving the ratio of wall clock time vs. error: Exponential Integration, Rational Approximation of Exponential Integration (REXI), Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time (PFASST) and Semi-Lagrangian methods combined with Parareal. We get improved time-vs.-error rates, but sometimes with additional challenges on the way which need to be further overcome. Overall, our results motivate further investigation and combination of these methods for operational weather/climate systems.

For instance, the two enzymes, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, have a lot of structural resemblances; however, elastase degrades virulence factors, while cathepsin G does not. But their crystal structures are remarkably similar. Molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to study the two enzymes in solvent and probe their conformational differences.    
The two protein structures do not have the same number of residues, which renders the measurement of the similarity over the duration of simulations problematic. In order to tackle the problem, we established and implemented a three-step-protocol: The Fréchet distance is used to superimpose the two protein structures, such that only internal motions will be probed in subsequent steps. The dynamic time warping algorithm and its penalty matrix is used to generate suitable pairs of amino acids between the two proteins. Lastly, a symmetrized version of the so-called Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed to quantify the difference and similarities between the two protein dynamics trajectories.    
The approach showed a subtle difference in a specific residue in the two protein trajectories, which might explain the difference in specificity.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75380' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1399)' class='star'><span class='star1399'>&star;</span></a> Christian Schulz  <span id='bitlink-3433'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3433)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3433' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3433)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Recent Advances in Streaming (Hyper)Graph Partitioning</b><br />Christian Schulz<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-308.html'>Recent Advances in Combinatorial Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>Partitioning a (hyper)graph into balanced blocks such that few edges run between blocks is a key problem for large-scale distributed processing. Currently there is a gap in the space of available algorithms. On the one hand, streaming algorithms have been adopted to partition massive graph data on small machines. In the streaming model, vertices arrive one at a time and then are directly assigned to a block. These algorithms partition huge graphs quickly with little memory, but produce partitions with low solution quality. On the other hand, there are offline (shared-memory) multilevel algorithms that produce partitions with high quality but also need a machine with enough memory to partition huge networks.    
In this talk, we present recent advances in streaming algorithms for the problem. First, we present a buffered streaming approach: this model allows to read more than one node and its neighborhood at the time. This enables our algorithm to leverage multilevel techniques, and thus significantly improve solution quality while surprisingly also enhancing the overall complexity of the algorithm.    
On the other hand, we present a shared-memory streaming multi-recursive partitioning scheme that performs recursive multi-sections on the fly without knowing the overall input graph to compute hierarchical partitionings.  If the topology of a distributed system is known, it is possible to further optimize the communication costs by mapping partitions onto processing elements.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75696' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1602)' class='star'><span class='star1602'>&star;</span></a> Volker H.

Therefore, the classical shape Hessian is not symmetric and does not admit a Taylor series, causing significant computational complications. This talk discusses the linear structure of deformations as a representation of shapes. This transforms shape optimization to a variant of optimal control. The numerical opportunities of this point of view are highlighted in particular in the case of large shape deformations, thus leading to fast algorithms of shape Newton type.  In this way, so far often heuristic omissions of non-symmetric terms in the shape Hessian obtain a theoretical foundation. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.

This system class comes with many desirable properties such as passivity and often also stability. Here, passivity refers, roughly speaking, to the inability of the system to internally generate energy out of nowhere. As a consequence, the pH framework may be used in the field of model reduction to ensure that the reduced-order models (ROMs) are stable and passive by employing structure-preserving methods.    
In this talk, we present a structure-preserving model reduction technique for port-Hamiltonian systems based on a recently proposed nonlinear model reduction approach. Especially, we consider a special nonlinear approximation ansatz where the state of the full-order model is approximated by a linear combination of transformed modes. These transformations may be for instance achieved by suitable translation or shift operators and allow to obtain low-dimensional and accurate approximations of transport-dominated systems. In order to achieve structure preservation, we demonstrate that the ROMs may be constructed by minimizing the residual in a suitably weighted norm. In this context, we also discuss stability of the resulting ROMs. Finally, the new approach is illustrated by means of a numerical test case.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75309' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1025)' class='star'><span class='star1025'>&star;</span></a> Joerg Schumacher  <span id='bitlink-3436'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3436)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3436' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3436)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Reservoir Computing for Thermally Driven Fluid Flows</b><br />Joerg Schumacher<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-224.html'>Quantum Computing for Engineering Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>Quantum computing and machine learning have changed our ways to process data fundamentally in the last years. A combination of both can be a promising way to accelerate data processing in the near future. Here, we discuss the porting of a classical recurrent neural network algorithm in the form of a reservoir computing model to a quantum computer. We simulate the nonlinear chaotic dynamics of Lorenz-type models for a classical two-dimensional thermal convection flow by a hybrid quantum--classical reservoir computing model. The high-dimensional quantum reservoir dynamics are established by universal quantum gates that rotate and entangle the individual qubits of the tensor product quantum state. A comparison of the quantum reservoir computing model with its classical counterpart shows that the same prediction and reconstruction capabilities of classical reservoirs with thousands of perceptrons can be obtained by a few strongly entangled qubits. This strong entanglement is shown to be essential for the performance of the quantum reservoir computing algorithm. Furthermore, the quantum reservoir computing model is implemented on a real noisy IBM quantum computer and compared with ideal quantum simulators. Our work opens the door to model the dynamics of classical complex systems in a high-dimensional phase space effectively with an algorithm that requires a small number of qubits.         </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75546' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1498)' class='star'><span class='star1498'>&star;</span></a> Catherine Schuman  <span id='bitlink-3437'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3437)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3437' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3437)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Neuromorphic Computing: Co-Design from Devices to Applications</b><br />Catherine Schuman<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-330.html'>Modern Directions in Electronic Devices:  Neuromorphic Devices, Memristors and Quantum Technologies</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75733' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2036)' class='star'><span class='star2036'>&star;</span></a> Matthias Schuster  <span id='bitlink-3438'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3438)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3438' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3438)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Shape Optimization for Interface Identification in Nonlocal Models</b><br />Matthias Schuster<br />Thursday, March 2 3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-423.html'>Student Days: Student Chapter Presentations - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Shape optimization methods have been proven useful for identifying interfaces in models governed by partial differential equations.

Likewise, although there is great understanding of many different kinds of disordered particle systems, and although many tools provide some insight into similarities and differences between them, no unified setting exists for describing relationships between different kinds of disorder.  We show that Voronoi topology can be used to map out the structural landscape of both ordered and disordered systems by considering the distributions of Voronoi cell topologies that can arise in the different systems.  This approach provides a new way to think about structural relationships between particle systems, ordered and disordered.  A new multithreaded version of VoroTop is used to analyze a large database of materials.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75601' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(449)' class='star'><span class='star449'>&star;</span></a> Paul Schwerdtner  <span id='bitlink-3440'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3440)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3440' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3440)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structured Optimization-Based Reduction and Identification of Dynamical Systems</b><br />Paul Schwerdtner<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-99.html'>Optimization-Based and Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling of Structured Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>We discuss the benefits of optimization-based alorithms for the model order reduction (MOR) and system identification of structured dynamical systems.

In this talk we will provide an overview of the ICC concept and its application to elastoplastic constitutive models and share technical progress on a few of its key components.

In order to reduce the computational effort, we combine these different approximation steps using the sparse grid combination technique. By this approach, no knowledge about the decay of the Karhunen-Loève coefficients and about the regularity of the solution is required. In a further step, we consider, additionally to the adaptivity in the sparse grid approach, an adaptive spatial discretization which allows also to adjust to singularities in the spatial variable.

By directly learning maps (operators) between infinite dimensional function spaces, these models are able to learn discretization invariant representations of target functions.  A common approach is to represent such target functions as linear combinations of basis elements learned from data. However, there are simple scenarios where, even though the target functions form a low dimensional submanifold, a very large number of basis elements is needed for an accurate linear representation. Here we present NOMAD, a novel operator learning framework with a nonlinear decoder map capable of learning finite dimensional representations of nonlinear submanifolds in function spaces.  We show this method is able to accurately learn low dimensional representations of solution manifolds to partial differential equations while outperforming linear models of larger size.  Additionally, we compare to state-of-the-art operator learning methods on a complex fluid dynamics benchmark and achieve competitive performance with a significantly smaller model size and training cost.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75335' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(339)' class='star'><span class='star339'>&star;</span></a> Maximilian Seifert  <span id='bitlink-3448'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3448)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3448' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3448)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Higher Radix Quantum Computation Through Optimal Control Under Experimental Constraints</b><br />Maximilian Seifert<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-75.html'>Optimal Control of Open Quantum Systems - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Current quantum hardware consists of tens or up to few hundreds of qubits, depending on the underlying architecture.

Based on collaborations with experimental groups, I will further address implications of experimental settings on control methods, discussing constraints as well as opportunities for optimal control approaches.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75325' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1951)' class='star'><span class='star1951'>&star;</span></a> Alireza Selahi  <span id='bitlink-3449'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3449)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3449' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3449)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Finite-Element-Solver for Coupled Domains in Rust</b><br />Alireza Selahi<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1668)' class='star'><span class='star1668'>&star;</span></a> Elizaveta Semenova  <span id='bitlink-3450'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3450)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3450' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3450)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Encoding Spatial Priors with VAEs for Small Area Estimation</b><br />Elizaveta Semenova<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-369.html'>Variational Inference: From Theory to Practice - Part I of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Gaussian processes (GPs), implemented through multivariate Gaussian distributions for a finite collection of data, are the most popular approach in small-area spatial statistical modelling. In this context, they are used to encode correlation structures over space and can generalize well in interpolation tasks. Despite their flexibility, off-the-shelf GPs present serious computational challenges which limit their scalability and practical usefulness in applied settings. Here, we propose a novel, deep generative modelling approach to tackle this challenge, termed PriorVAE: for a particular spatial setting, we approximate a class of GP priors through prior sampling and subsequent fitting of a variational autoencoder (VAE). Given a trained VAE, the resultant decoder allows spatial inference to become incredibly efficient due to the low dimensional, independently distributed latent Gaussian space representation of the VAE. Once trained, inference using the VAE decoder replaces the GP within a Bayesian sampling framework. This approach provides tractable and easy-to-implement means of approximately encoding spatial priors and facilitates efficient statistical inference. We demonstrate the utility of our VAE two-stage approach on Bayesian, small-area estimation tasks.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75807' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1995)' class='star'><span class='star1995'>&star;</span></a> Elizaveta Semenova  <span id='bitlink-3451'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3451)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3451' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3451)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Bayesian Scientific Computing and Probabilistic Programming: Inside and Outside the &#8220;Black Box&#8221;</b><br />Elizaveta Semenova<br />Tuesday, February 28 9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-413.html'>Bayesian Scientific Computing and Probabilistic Programming: Inside and Outside the “Black Box” - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77163' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1999)' class='star'><span class='star1999'>&star;</span></a> Elizaveta Semenova  <span id='bitlink-3452'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3452)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3452' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3452)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Bayesian Scientific Computing and Probabilistic Programming: Inside and Outside the &#8220;Black Box&#8221;</b><br />Elizaveta Semenova<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-414.html'>Bayesian Scientific Computing and Probabilistic Programming: Inside and Outside the “Black Box” - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77164' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1560)' class='star'><span class='star1560'>&star;</span></a> Evgenia Y.

A major drawback of this approach is that boundary conditions are not properly used to constrain the solution and the weighting factors in the objective function are problem specific and not known a priori. Additional complications arise when multi-fidelity observations are introduced into the objective function as well. To address these limitations in a principled fashion, we pursue equality constraint optimization to determine the parameters of neural networks. In our approach, we adopt the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to constrain PDE loss with its boundary conditions and any high-fidelity observations that may be available for the PDE at hand. Furthermore, we present a strategy to learn non-smooth solutions, where we introduce auxiliary parameters to reduce the order of differential operators and further constrain the solution.  We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our framework by applying it to several forward and inverse problems involving multi-dimensional PDEs. We achieve orders of magnitude improvements in accuracy levels in comparison with state-of-the-art physics-informed neural networks.

In this talk, we present an efficient and stable immersed boundary (IB) method for solving the motion of elastic interface, in particular, when the fluid has high inertia and the interface has strong elasticity.    
Our contributions are three folds. First, an iteration-free semi-Lagrangian approach is used in Navier-Stokes equations so that the high inertial effect of fluid is more stably simulated. Second, the elastic interfacial force is treated semi-implicitly allowing to handle strong elasticity and also to construct a resulting linear system. Last but not least, in solving the original linear system, we transform the 3-by-3 block matrix to a reduced 2-by-2 block matrix after eliminating the fluid pressure term. Such rank reduction is possible by applying the discrete Leray projection operator in a staggered MAC grid. By virtue of this feature, we call our method as a reduced immersed boundary method (rIBM). The equivalence between the rIBM and the original problem is proved in a theorem. Then an efficient algorithm for finding two unknowns is suggested using the Schur complement. We provide numerical results which show that the proposed rIBM improves both the numerical stability and the computational speed when solving more realistic problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75810' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1573)' class='star'><span class='star1573'>&star;</span></a> Radu Serban  <span id='bitlink-3456'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3456)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3456' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3456)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A GPU-Based DEM Solver for Large-Scale Granular Simulations</b><br />Radu Serban<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-346.html'>Recent Developments on GPU-Based Solvers in High-Performance Computing - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>We present a new generation GPU-based solver for large scale granular dynamics simulations, using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). This simulation infrastructure is a step beyond our current DEM solver available in the open-source multi-physics package Chrono. The new solver uses two GPUs to accelerate the simulation, one dedicated to collision detection and related kinematic calculations, the other dedicated to advancing the dynamics of the granular material.  We use just-in-time compiling to allow customization and to leverage the specific architecture of the execution hardware. Finally, the solver leverages CUB, an efficient CUDA utility package for parallel primitives.  The resulting solver, distributed under a BSD license, provides an open-source efficient solution for DEM problems with millions of degrees of freedom.  After a brief description of the underlying methods, we discuss the implementation of the new solver and illustrate its capabilities on several large-scale DEM problems. One of these is simulation of extraterrestrial rovers over deformable terrain; the terrain is a granular dynamics representation of the Glenn Research Center lunar soil simulant \#1 (GRC-1), designed and manufactured to match geotechnical properties of lunar soil.  The capabilities and performance of this new solver promise to enable, on relatively inexpensive hardware, simulations of a scale previously possible only on supercomputers.

Reduced order models (ROM)s can provide significant speed-up compared to direct numerical simulations, however, they typically lack accuracy and stability for long-time predictions. We propose a structure-preserving neural ODE architecture to promote long-term stability. The network is parameterized so that any choice of weights results in a fast-slow dynamical system where the linearized dynamics are dissipative. This is achieved by using a general Schur-based parameterization for the linear portion of the neural ODE and ensuring that the eigenvalues lie on or to the left of imaginary axis. The split between the fast and slow eigenvalues is controlled through the use of a (known) physical parameter. The architecture is asymptotic-preserving in the limit of this parameter approaching zero. It is shown that the a slow manifold exists when the parameter is sufficiently small. Using the Schur-based parameterization of the linear term, an efficient IMEX scheme is developed for integrating the stiff neural ODE system forward in time and a fast adjoint-based method is utilized to estimate gradients with respect to the tunable weights. It will be demonstrated that the asymptotic behavior is preserved in the limit of the physical parameter approaching zero and that the model can robustly integrated to longer times beyond the training interval. Potential future applications of the proposed architecture include fusion modeling, accelerator physics, and weather prediction, where long time dynamics can be of great interest.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75269' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1744)' class='star'><span class='star1744'>&star;</span></a> Patrick Shafto  <span id='bitlink-3458'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3458)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3458' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3458)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Discrete Probabilistic Inverse Optimal Transport</b><br />Patrick Shafto<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-384.html'>Inverse Optimal Transport - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75852' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(559)' class='star'><span class='star559'>&star;</span></a> Imran Shah  <span id='bitlink-3459'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3459)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3459' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3459)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reduced Order Modeling for Real-Time Shape Optimization of the Total Cavopulmonary Connection in Fontan Surgical Planning</b><br />Imran Shah<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-122.html'>Model Order Reduction Methods for Parameterized Fluid Flows - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>The Fontan operation is a surgery for children born with ventricular defects, where the inferior vena cava (IVC) is routed to the pulmonary arteries (PA) to form the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). This represents a shape optimization problem, where differences in the anatomy result in unique hemodynamics. However, the costs of simulating such cases via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) becomes extremely expensive, especially for testing various TCPC geometries in a trial-and-error fashion. Here, we introduce a reduced order modeling (ROM) framework for real-time shape optimization of the TCPC. In the offline phase of the ROM, the IVC offset with respect to the PAs was parameterized resulting in 100 transient CFD simulations being performed, from which a snapshot library was created. The library was recycled in the online stage for a new set of parameters using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition approach. A shape optimization problem was implemented using the framework, where the optimization criteria was based on the hepatic flow distribution (HFD). ROM solutions were in strong agreement with full order model (FOM) solutions with regards to pressure, velocity, and flow dynamics. The FOM required an average of 153.5 seconds while the ROM reduced this to 27.5 seconds, an 82.1% decrease in computation time. Using this framework, the optimal TCPC geometry for a given HFD value was rapidly calculated, requiring less than 15 minutes for finding the optimal solution.

Existing intrusive projection-based model reduction approaches construct structure-preserving Lagrangian ROMs by projecting the Euler-Lagrange equations of the full-order model (FOM) onto a linear subspace. This Galerkin projection step requires complete knowledge about the Lagrangian operators in the FOM and full access to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the proposed Lagrangian operator inference approach embeds the mechanics into the operator inference framework to develop a data-driven model reduction method that preserves the underlying Lagrangian structure.

Our climate model belongs to the class of intermediate coupled models which are much simpler than the coupled general circulation models of the ocean-atmosphere system but still allow to study the fundamental aspects of ocean-atmosphere interactions. Our model couples an atmosphere system, described by the compressible two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations and an advection-diffusion equation for temperature, to an ocean system, given by 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and an advection-diffusion equation for temperature. Finite element method is used to discretize the system of partial differential equations representing the climate model on a 2D periodic domain and the discrete model is solved using Firedrake, which is an efficient automated finite element method library. The accuracy of simulation results of the climate model is ensured by carrying out detailed numerical investigation of its atmosphere and ocean components separately and then testing our codes against some benchmark problems available in the literature. Our final goal is to incorporate stochasticity into the coupled ocean-atmosphere model following the Hasselmann's paradigm [Klaus Hasselmann, Stochastic climate models part I. Theory, 1976] and use the model to study key features of climate phenomena like El-Nino Southern Oscillation. This will be the subject of our future work.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75467' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1691)' class='star'><span class='star1691'>&star;</span></a> Nir Sharon  <span id='bitlink-3466'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3466)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3466' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3466)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Compactification of the Rigid Motions Group in Image Processing</b><br />Nir Sharon<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-374.html'>Problems and Solutions in 3-D Reconstruction - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Image processing problems in general, particularly in the field of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, often require considering images up to their rotations and translations. Such issues were tackled successfully for the case of rotations only, using quantities that are invariant to the action of rotations on images. However, extending these methods to cases involving translations is more complicated.     
This talk presents a computationally feasible and theoretically sound method of approximate invariant to the action of rotations and translations on images. Our approach allows one to reduce image processing problems to similar problems but over the sphere -- a compact domain acted on by the group of 3D rotations. We show that our invariant is induced by a family of deformed mappings, thereby compactifying the group structure of rotations and translations of the plane, i.e., the group of rigid motions, into the compact group of 3D rotations. Furthermore, we demonstrate its viability for image classification.

We present a novel parallel algorithm that is efficient both in theory and in practice. Our algorithm achieves a work complexity matching the best sequential algorithm while also having low depth (parallel running time), which significantly improves upon the only existing parallel nucleus decomposition algorithm (Sariyuce et al., PVLDB 2018). The key to the theoretical efficiency of our algorithm is the use of a theoretically-efficient parallel algorithms for clique listing and bucketing. We introduce several new practical optimizations, including a new multi-level hash table structure to store information on cliques space-efficiently and a technique for traversing this structure cache-efficiently. On a 30-core machine with two-way hyper-threading on real-world graphs, we achieve up to a 55x speedup over the state-of-the-art parallel nucleus decomposition algorithm by Sariyuce et al., and up to a 40x self-relative parallel speedup. We are able to efficiently compute larger nucleus decompositions than prior work on several million-scale graphs for the first time.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75881' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1639)' class='star'><span class='star1639'>&star;</span></a> Tianyi Shi  <span id='bitlink-3471'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3471)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3471' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3471)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On the Parallelization of Sketching Algorithms for the Tensor-Train Decomposition</b><br />Tianyi Shi<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-362.html'>Randomized Solvers in Large-Scale Scientific Computing - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we propose TT-Sketching, a new parallelizable tensor-train decomposition algorithm for streaming tensor data.

This general framework can be extended to other algebraic and geometric structures. Our formulation has the following advantages: it can tolerate corruption as high as the information-theoretic bound, it does not require a good initialization for the estimates of absolute orientations, it has a simple interpretation, and under some mild conditions the global minimum of our objective function exactly recovers the corruption levels.

However, parallel scaling is still limited by the sequential timestepping schemes commonly used in these applications. Here I will present recent progress towards investigating various parallel in time algorithms for compatible finite element disrectisations of the shallow water equations.

Global deterministic model forecasts are currently carried out 4 times a day with $\sim$10km horizontal resolution, while more detailed short-to-medium-range regional forecasts over the UK are run more frequently using a 1.5km resolution. Seasonal and climate configurations use lower resolutions, but with additional complexity in the physics packages and coupling to ocean models.    
The challenges presented by future generations of computer architecture require a redesign of our software and algorithms, so the Met Office is developing LFRic - its next generation atmosphere model. To span the scales for weather and climate efficiently and accurately, a mixed-finite element non-hydrostatic dynamical core is used alongside finite volume transport and finite difference sub-grid physical parametrizations (e.g., solar radiation, clouds) all combined through a semi-implicit time-step.  Achieving greater levels of parallelism and more efficiently targeting spatial resolution will be a key feature to obtain efficient time-to-solution with the greatest level of accuracy.  We will discuss two aspects: accessing greater task parallelism through operator splitting in the semi-implicit timestep and refining/coarsening spatial resolution between different components (e.g., dynamical core, sub-grid physics) of the system.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75567' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1239)' class='star'><span class='star1239'>&star;</span></a> David Shirokoff  <span id='bitlink-3478'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3478)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3478' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3478)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Weak Stage Order Theory and Order Barriers for Runge-Kutta Methods</b><br />David Shirokoff<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-272.html'>Innovations in Time Integration of Stiff Systems of Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Runge-Kutta (RK) methods may exhibit order reduction when applied to stiff problems. For linear problems with time-independent operators, order reduction can be avoided if the method satisfies certain weak stage order (WSO) conditions. WSO is less restrictive than traditional stage order conditions and compatible with a DIRK structure.  This talk will present the first general order barrier bounds relating the WSO of a scheme to its classical order and number of stages. These bounds characterize the fundamental accuracy limit of RK methods applied to stiff problems.  New necessary conditions are also established on how one needs to split the spectrum of the Butcher matrix A to devise schemes with WSO – which we use to construct new families of high WSO schemes.  The key mathematical ideas are to recast WSO into a pair of orthogonal invariant subspaces and perform calculations modulo minimal polynomials. We also provide new formulas for the RK stability function.

Boundary integral methods have several advantages in SH flow computations.  However, such problems exhibit flow singularities due to complex surface microstructure, which leads to mixed boundary conditions and geometric corners. Standard quadrature rules for smooth integrals result in a severe loss of accuracy.  Adaptive mesh refinement mitigates the issue, however, the size of the discrete problem grows significantly with refinement level, and it can still be difficult to obtain satisfactory accuracy due to the ill-conditioning of the linear system. To resolve these issues, we combine the recently developed Recursively Compressed Inverse Preconditioning (RCIP) method with a scaling technique and the Fast Multipole Method to obtain a fast and accurate numerical scheme for SH flow computations. Several examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the method.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75518' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(464)' class='star'><span class='star464'>&star;</span></a> Eva Siegmann  <span id='bitlink-3482'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3482)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3482' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3482)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Porting An Ocean Modeling Application to Fujitsu A64FX</b><br />Eva Siegmann<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-103.html'>Performance Engineering and Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>In this presentation we report our preliminary efforts in porting ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) to Fujitsu A64FX.

Recent works on coupling of hyperbolic systems based on solving two half Riemann problems can be useful but require expensive iterative procedures at  every quadrature point. The iterative coupling method is in the same spirit as the finite-volume Godunov scheme. Thus, the most natural  step to improve its performance  is to approximate the solutions of the half Riemann problems using techniques established for finite-volume methods.  In this work we investigate multiple approximate-state and the Roe Riemann solvers coupling systems of hyperbolic conservation laws.

Methods such as the multi-fidelity ensemble Kalman filter (MFEnKF) and the multi-level ensemble Kalman filter (MLEnKF) have been developed and implemented in several papers and are recognized as state-of-the-art techniques. However, the construction of low-fidelity models in the offline stage, prior to solving the data assimilation problem, leads these methods into a trade-off between the accuracy and computational cost of the approximate models. In this work, we investigate the use of adaptive reduced-basis techniques in which the approximation space is modified (but not retrained) online based on the information extracted from the full-order solutions. This has the potential to simultaneously ensure good accuracy and low cost for the employed models and thus improve the performance of the multi-fidelity/multi-level methods.

The software is written entirely in the Julia programming language and uses a rich system of abstractions not easily implemented in the traditional languages of climate science, such as Fortran and C. Additionally, by leveraging the Julia infrastructure, Oceananigans allows switching the computation between CPU and GPU architectures seamlessly, making it the perfect tool to prototype, test, and run large-scale ocean simulations. We demonstrate the usability and the performance of Oceananigans by integrating two relevant global setups, an eddy-permitting simulation at a 0.25-degree resolution and an eddy-resolving one at a 0.1-degree resolution. While the former fits entirely on one gaming-grade GPU, the latter requires parallelizing the computation on a minimum of three scientific programming GPUs. We examine the software's scalability and accuracy along with the performance for both test cases, showing optimal results compared to state-of-the-art ocean models. We argue that it is primarily the use of Julia that allows us to implement a high-level model that is easy and engaging but also attains good scaling and absolute performance on large-scale climate problems.

The current work is aimed at studying the problem of an acoustically generated bubble collapse using high accuracy simulations. Typically, high-order methods have stability issues, especially when considering complex physics. However, in the last decade, there has been considerable progress made in developing provably nonlinearly stable schemes for conservative problems by combining summation-by-parts (SBP) operators and symmetric two-point flux functions. The goal of this work is to develop provably-stable high-order schemes for multiphase flows in non conservative form. To achieve this goal, the framework of Renac is leveraged to develop an entropy-stable SBP scheme using a non-symmetric two-point flux function. However, quantities such as density and void fractions of each phase require positivity to be preserved. To this end,   the work of Upperman and Yamaleev is utilised to determine the appropriate time step to take to preserve positivity of these quantities. In this presentation, the details of the resulting schemes and numerical tests on smooth flows are presented.

However, this vital component of life is ill-effected by fast-paced industrialization, urbanization, automobiles, factories and coal-based thermal power generation as over the years these have jeopardized the air quality index. Due to hazardous impact of black carbon on the environment as well as human health, researchers have turned their attention towards its study. The comparative analysis of artificial neural network and econometric models used to predict the time series of monthly observations of black carbon emissions from three major coal mines located at Bokaro, Jharia and Raniganj in India. These coal mines have large emissions of particulate matter ( ) that contribute significantly to pollution levels. A multilayer perceptron feedforward artificial neural network is used to predict the black carbon concentration data from these three coal mines. The neural network is trained using a Bayesian regularization backpropagation algorithm. The efficiency of neural network models is evaluated by mean absolute deviation (MAD), root mean square (RMSE), and coefficient of determination ( ) values. The results obtained are then compared with the well-known and widely used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The results of the study reveal the effective performance of artificial neural networks over the ARIMA model in forecasting black carbon concentration data.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75888' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1914)' class='star'><span class='star1914'>&star;</span></a> Navjot Singh  <span id='bitlink-3490'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3490)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3490' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3490)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Distributed-Memory Algorithms for Tucker Tensor Completion</b><br />Navjot Singh<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1141)' class='star'><span class='star1141'>&star;</span></a> Satyvir Singh  <span id='bitlink-3491'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3491)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3491' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3491)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Explicit Modal Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Vlasov-Poisson System</b><br />Satyvir Singh<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-250.html'>Efficient Numerical Frameworks for Kinetic And Related Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>In plasma physics, the Vlasov-Poisson system characterizes the behavior of a collisionless plasma subject to electrostatic effects in terms of the corresponding distribution function in phase space. Due to high dimensionality (3D space + 3D velocity + 1D time) and their intrinsic physical properties (conservation and positivity), the construction of an efficient numerical method represents a challenge and requires a careful balance between accuracy and computational complexity.      
In this research, the development of a numerical method for solving the multi-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system is demonstrated. A modal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme based on rectangular/hexahedral meshes is employed for the numerical solution of the multi-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system. For the spatial discretization, the polynomial solutions are represented by scaled Legendre basis functions, and the numerical flux based on an upwind scheme is used for the solution stability. All the integrals appearing in the DG formulation are approximated with the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule. A third-order explicit SSP-RK-based temporal discretization scheme is used for the resulting semi-discrete ordinary differential equation. We study the convergence analysis of the proposed scheme. The performance of the proposed scheme is assessed by solving some benchmarks in the simulations of plasma physics, including two-stream instability, weak and strong Landau damping, etc.

The environmental conditions are generally simulated to assess the reliability of the proposed designs. Hence the simulations can become computationally very expensive. Moreover, some input conditions can lead to simulation failures or instabilities, due, for instance, to convergence issues of the numerical scheme of complex partial derivative equations. Most of the time, the set of inputs corresponding to failures is not known a priori and corresponds to a hidden constraint, also called crash constraint in this special case. Since the observation of a simulation failure might be as costly as a feasible simulation, we seek to learn the feasible set of inputs and thus target areas without simulation failure during the optimization process. Therefore, we propose a Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPC) active learning method to learn the feasible domain. The proposed methodology is an adaptation of Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction strategies usually used with Gaussian Process Regression, in the classification setting with GPC models. The performance of this strategy on toy problems and on a wind turbine design application will be presented.

We use a divide-and-conquer approach that is accelerated by the fast multipole method (FMM). For bivariate analogues of the classical orthogonal polynomials, including spherical harmonics, Zernike polynomials, and Proriol polynomials on the triangle, a measure-preserving connection is developed to convert expansions into tensor product bases that are suitable for FFTW-based synthesis and analysis. It is empirically well-known that these measure-preserving connection problems (and overall syntheses and analyses) may be compressed by the butterfly factorization. We provide an incremental contribution to the theoretical underpinning by relating the connection coefficients to Fourier integral operators.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75327' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(476)' class='star'><span class='star476'>&star;</span></a> Elyssa Sliheet  <span id='bitlink-3495'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3495)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3495' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3495)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Predicting Biophysical Properties of Proteins</b><br />Elyssa Sliheet<br />Wednesday, March 1 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-105.html'>Shape and Size in Medicine, Biotechnology and Materials Science - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>We report our recent work for the prediction of protein binding affinity using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Fair coins can even be used to simulate the flips of biased coins, and biased coins can also be exploited to sample distributions. Deterministic computing and PRNGs are able to exploit such simple relations. Stochastic devices that exhibit two state behavior, however, may not be able to be reliably classified as a Bernoulli coin flip with a fixed probability.  Devices may behave statistically as such a coin over many, many draws, but they may actually fluctuate between values or behave in some other pathological way. This talk examines the consequences of utilizing a noisy device for probabilistic computation under the assumption it is behaving as a fair or biased Bernoulli coin flip when the underlying dynamics are actually much more complex. We aim to categorize such a TRNG under appropriate metrics analogous to those used for PRNG today.

Time eigenvalues of an infinite medium neutron transport problem with delayed neutrons, and consequently several time scales, are found with V-DMD. Lastly,  V-DMD is demonstrated to calculate time eigenvalues with accuracy very similar to the typical DMD approach in systems where that typical approach can be used.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75291' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(142)' class='star'><span class='star142'>&star;</span></a> Stephen Smith  <span id='bitlink-3498'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3498)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3498' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3498)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multifidelity Methods for Uncertainty Quantification of Pollutant Dispersion Models Using Control Variates with Estimated Means</b><br />Stephen Smith<br />Friday, March 3 10:40 AM&ndash;10:55 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-31.html'>Multi-Fidelity Methods for Uncertainty Quantification and Optimization - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Air quality is a pressing public health issue facing modern society. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimate 4.2 million deaths are linked annually to ambient air pollution. This issue having a huge impact on society leading to public measures of frustration such as current attempts by a group of citizens sue the German government over its lack of progress in meeting WHO recommendations on air quality levels presented in 2021. Understanding the key factors driving air pollution the combination of accurate pollution measurement techniques as well as detailed computational models of the underlying physical processes. The uncertainty in the model input leads to uncertainty in the model output. To quantify this uncertainty we use a Monte-Carlo (MC) approach based on      random samples from the input parameter PDFs. To improve the computational efficiency of the MC method we consider a range of multifidelity computational models and use a control variate approach to minimise the mean squared error of estimate of the mean of the model output. The classical control variate approach assumes known values for the means of the low fidelity models. In this talk we present results of techniques used to estimate these means and the optimal strategy of combining the multifidelity models.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75247' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(973)' class='star'><span class='star973'>&star;</span></a> Jacob Snoeijer  <span id='bitlink-3499'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3499)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3499' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3499)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Modeling and Computing Thin Films on Flexible Substrates</b><br />Jacob Snoeijer<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-212.html'>Recent Advances in Computations and Modeling of Thin Fluid Films - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75525' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(693)' class='star'><span class='star693'>&star;</span></a> Aleksandros Sobczyk  <span id='bitlink-3500'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3500)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3500' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3500)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Approximate Euclidean Lengths and Distances Beyond Johnson-Lindenstrauss</b><br />Aleksandros Sobczyk<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-152.html'>Randomized Numerical Algorithms for Matrix and Tensor Analysis - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>In this presentation we will dive in the core of Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra and present out recent results  (Sobczyk and Luisier, NeurIPS 2022) related to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma and its applications. We revisit a key problem: how to approximate the Euclidean lengths (or distances) of a set of high-dimensional vectors. Can we do better than JL? Based on techniques which are inspired by the recently published Hutch++ algorithm for trace estimation, we proposed algorithms which can (provably) improve the standard JL bounds, both in theory and in practice. We will describe all these algorithms and sketch the proof techniques. These improvements can ultimately lead to more practical and efficient randomized algorithms for scientific computing, especially when high accuracy is required, which is a known shortcoming of JL-based random projections. We will also discuss how these results can be applied to other problems, namely to compute Euclidean distances between high-dimensional data points, to estimate the statistical leverage scores of a matrix, and to approximate the charge densities in a quantum mechanical system.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75447' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(170)' class='star'><span class='star170'>&star;</span></a> Pierre Sochala  <span id='bitlink-3501'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3501)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3501' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3501)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Uncertainty Propagation in Pore Water Chemical Composition Calculation Using Surrogate Models</b><br />Pierre Sochala<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-37.html'>Probabilistic Methods for Model-Form Uncertainty</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>Performance assessment in deep geological nuclear waste repository systems necessitates an extended knowledge of the pore water chemical conditions prevailing in host-rock formations. In the last two decades, important progress has been made in the experimental characterization and thermodynamic modeling of pore water speciation, but the influence of experimental artifacts and uncertainties of thermodynamic input parameters are seldom evaluated. In this respect, we conducted an uncertainty propagation study in a reference geochemical model describing the pore water chemistry of the Callovian-Oxfordian clay formation. Nineteen model input parameters were perturbed, including those associated to experimental characterization (leached anions, exchanged cations, cation exchange selectivity coefficients) and those associated to generic thermodynamic databases (solubilities). A set of 13 quantities of interest were studied by the use of polynomial chaos expansions built non-intrusively with a least-squares forward stepwise regression approach. Training and validation sets of simulations were carried out using the geochemical speciation code PHREEQC. The statistical results explored the marginal distribution of each quantity of interest, their bivariate correlations as well as their global sensitivity indices. The influence of the assumed distributions for input parameters uncertainties was evaluated by considering two parametric domain sizes.

The method is based on the representation of a Dunford-Cauchy integral along a contour which encompasses the spectrum of an unbounded infinitesimal operator A corresponding to the equation. The discrete operator is constructed as a discretization of diffusion and advective, resp. convective terms by the Radial Basis Functions with generalized Finite Difference (RBF-FD) method. A contour is chosen to be of the elliptic shape with varying number of cubature points. Numerical performance of the contour integral method is compared with sequential-in-time realizations of the $\theta$-scheme. The studied algorithm is 2$N_{\textrm{time}}N_{\textrm{quad}}$ parallelizable, where $N_{\textrm{time}}$ is the number of time points at which the numerical solution is computed and $N_{\textrm{quad}}$ is the number of cubature points on the contour. The method is flexible with respect to the choice of a discretization method and can be extended to multiple dimensions. Corresponding numerical examples are demonstrated.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75599' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(285)' class='star'><span class='star285'>&star;</span></a> Mikhail V.

In most/many cases, those solution mappings and optimal-value functions are nonsmooth,  and the optimal-value function is also possibly nonconvex (even if the defining data  is smooth and convex).  Moreover, stemming from solving optimization problems, those solution mappings and  value-functions are usually not known explicitly, via any closed formulas.  We present an approach to regularize and approximate solution mappings of fully  parametrized convex optimization problems that combines interior penalty (log-barrier)  with Tikhonov regularization. Because the regularized solution mappings are single-valued  and smooth under reasonable conditions, they can also be used to build a computationally  practical smoothing for the associated optimal-value function and/or solution mapping.  Applications are presented to two-stage (possibly nonconvex) stochastic  programming, and to a certain class of hierarchical decision problems  that can be viewed as single-leader multi-follower games.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75304' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(692)' class='star'><span class='star692'>&star;</span></a> Edgar Solomonik  <span id='bitlink-3505'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3505)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3505' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3505)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Faster Accurate Sketching for Tensor Networks</b><br />Edgar Solomonik<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-152.html'>Randomized Numerical Algorithms for Matrix and Tensor Analysis - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>Linear sketches with tensor product structure provide an effective tool for accelerating decomposition of tensors.

Naive implementations using IF-THEN-ELSE branching give unreliable simulation results without warning, as switching events are undetectable by standard integrators. The widespread belief that this can be countered using more stringent integration tolerances is wrong: We give a simple example where the integrator’s error estimation always delivers zero.    
Correct treatment of switched systems requires elaborate formulation of switching functions and tailored integrators, placing high mathematical demands on modelers. Even small model changes often imply considerable reformulation effort. Further, $n$ switches generate up to $2^n$ possible program flows and switching functions, rendering a-priori formulations not feasible already in medium-sized models.    
IFDIFF programmatically handles switching events, auto-generating only required switching functions. It determines switching times up to machine precision, and ensures accurate simulation and sensitivity results. Transparently extending the Matlab integrators (ode45, ode15s, etc.), IFDIFF is applicable to existing code with state- and parameter-dependent conditionals, thus enabling fast prototyping and relieving modelers of mathematical-technical effort.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77155' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(47)' class='star'><span class='star47'>&star;</span></a> Eric Sonnendr&#252;cker  <span id='bitlink-3510'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3510)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3510' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3510)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structure Preserving Numerical Methods for Gyrokinetic Models</b><br />Eric Sonnendr&#252;cker<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-11.html'>Computational Methods for Kinetic Models - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>For long time simulations, especially relevant in magnetic fusion devices like tokamaks and stellarators, the conservation of invariants is essential to get physically relevant results.

Identifying and understanding these mechanisms is key for adapting the switching characteristics to the requirements of specific computational schemes and improving performance and reproducibility.   Here, we present numerical models to analyze the memristive behavior of memristive devices. A finite volume model self-consistently solves the semiconductor equations for the electrostatic potential and the quasi-Fermi levels of electrons and holes. Further, we include the dynamics of mobile dopants and briefly discuss the boundary conditions implemented for the calculation of the switching dynamics and the current-voltage characteristics. A simplified physics-based device model is introduced to reduce the computational effort and enable large-scale simulations of arrays at the expense of physical accuracy. Simulations are compared with measurements on various types of memristive devices, including vertical TiOx/AlOx/HfOx thin-film stacks and quasi-two-dimensional flake devices.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75733' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(630)' class='star'><span class='star630'>&star;</span></a> Nicolai Spicher  <span id='bitlink-3515'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3515)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3515' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3515)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Examination of a Deep Neural Network for Biosignal Classification Reveals Features Similar to Clinical Criteria</b><br />Nicolai Spicher<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-138.html'>EU-MATHS-IN: Success Stories of Mathematical Technologies in Societal Challenges and Industry, Part I</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />Auditorium<br /><br /><small>Computer-aided diagnosis of biomedical signals culminated recently in deep learning (DL) methods, often outperforming human experts. However, these methods remain unadopted in clinical practice which is partially due to their lack in explainability. In this talk, we address this issue using electrocardiography (ECG) as use-case.    
We apply a pre-trained DL network for classification of 12-lead ECG signals that has been trained on more than 2 million signals and classify signals from a publicly-available ECG dataset. Additionally, we apply the method 'Integrated Gradients' which assigns a positive or negative relevance to each sample of a classified signals, pointing towards or against the classification; thereby allowing to understand the relationship between model prediction and learned features.    
We compare the relevance values of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation (AF) or left bundle branch block (LBBB) to healthy controls. Results show that the network learned cardiology textbook knowledge: Visible P-waves and concordant T-waves both result in a distinct negative relevance in AF and LBBB classification, respectively. Moreover, the difference in relevance between healthy controls and patients w.r.t. ECG leads is in line with clinical recommendations.    
In summary, our analysis suggests that the network learned features similar to clinical experience. Integrating this analysis in an application could be useful for quality control of diagnosis or teaching.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75427' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1108)' class='star'><span class='star1108'>&star;</span></a> Raymond J.

Over the last thirty years, there has been significant progress in understanding the stability of ultra thin films, where disjoining pressure creates a linear instability that leads to a hole forming (the so-called `spinodal regime'). Notably, it is known that thermal capillary nanowaves, driven by Brownian motion in the bulk, play a key role in speeding up this instability.    
Here, we consider an alternative and complementary possibility - that the formation of rogue nanowaves can lead to the rupture of linearly stable films.  Experimentally, such a `thermal regime' has been observed, but a theoretical framework and predictive capability for this regime is absent.    
In this talk, it will be shown that the film's dynamics can be described by a stochastic thin film equation, which naturally captures the generation of nanowaves and, once solved computationally, predicts the rupture of linearly stable nanofilms.  Then, using large deviation theory, which has recently been applied to model rogue ocean waves, we are able to formulate a theory which describes the most likely route to rupture and the timescale associated with this process, which compare well to our direct simulations.  Finally, comparisons to experimental analyses and molecular simulations will be presented and directions of future research discussed.

In the machine learning community slice sampling is a frequently used approach, which appears not only there as standard sampling tool. In particular, the elliptical slice sampler attracted in the last decade considerable attention as a dimension-robust algorithm. However, from a theoretical point of view it is not well understood.   In this talk, we present theoretical results regarding the geometric ergodicity of Markov chains generated by elliptical slice sampling as well as simple slice sampling. Moreover, we outline how multilevel or multifidelity ideas can be combined with (elliptical) slice sampling in order to reduce the (usually) significant computational cost of this promising Markov chain Monte Carlo method.

Structural information (fracture size, orientation, etc.) plays a key role in governing the dominant physics for these systems but can only be known statistically. Traditional modeling approaches either ignore or idealize structural information at these larger scales because we lack a computational framework that utilizes it in its entirety. The work presented here integrates computational physics, machine learning and graph theory to make a paradigm shift from computationally intensive high-fidelity models to coarse-scale graphs without loss of critical structural information. We exploit the underlying discrete structure of fracture networks in systems considering flow through fractures and fracture propagation. We demonstrate that compact graph representations require significantly fewer degrees of freedom (dof) to capture micro-fracture information and further accelerate these models with Machine Learning.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75393' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1212)' class='star'><span class='star1212'>&star;</span></a> Ishan Srivastava  <span id='bitlink-3522'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3522)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3522' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3522)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Upscaling Particulate Simulations Towards Continuum Modeling of Dense Granular Flows</b><br />Ishan Srivastava<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-266.html'>Computational and Theoretical Advances for Multiphase Flows</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>At high solid volume fractions, the dynamics of dense granular materials are dominated by enduring inter-particle contacts that emerge as intriguing macroscale phenomena such as yield stress, normal stress effects, and geometry-dependent rheology. Particle-based simulations such as the Discrete Element Method (DEM) are well-suited to resolve particulate features, but ill-suited for modeling at continuum scales. Whereas continuum modeling is ideally suited for macroscale simulations, there is a lack of a general constitutive model that correctly accounts for loading geometry and higher-order rate effects. This talk will describe our computational efforts in upscaling DEM simulations towards continuum modeling by developing tensorial rheological models of dense granular flows. DEM-based numerical methods that can simulate granular flows to infinitely large strains for arbitrary imposed loading geometries will be described. These simulations were used to calibrate a frame-indifferent, tensorial, viscoplastic rheological model that is valid for various deformation geometries beyond shear, such as biaxial and triaxial deformations. This talk will describe our ongoing work on implementing a regularized version of the tensorial rheological model in an incompressible flow solver towards simulating dense granular materials at the continuum.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75606' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1618)' class='star'><span class='star1618'>&star;</span></a> Nikhil Srivastava  <span id='bitlink-3523'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3523)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3523' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3523)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A New Fractional Differentiation Formula for Caputo Fractional Derivatives and Its Application</b><br />Nikhil Srivastava<br />Friday, March 3 12:30 AM&ndash;12:45 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-357.html'>Efficient Kernel Methods - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>In this talk, a new fractional differentiation formula is proposed for the Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (1,2)$.

A key feature of the model is that the fluid density varies considerably across the computational domain. Extremely ill-conditioned problems arise for incompressible and reacting flows in the low Mach flow regime, particularly for cut-cell meshes in complex geometries, where non-covered cells that are cut by the domain boundar have arbitrarily small volumes and areas.  The standard Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel AMG smoothers are less effective in these cases at reducing the error at each level of the AMG $V$-cycle and may   result in very large iteration counts for the GMRES+AMG solver.    
Prenter (2020) improved convergence rates for cut-cells and  conjugate-gradient solvers with AMG preconditioners by employing Schwarz  smoothers. We combine ILU smoothers using iterative triangular solves with  restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) adapted to hypre for a new iterated   Gauss-Seidel formulation of GMRES with AMG preconditioner.   The iteration counts tend to remain constant and these smoothers reduce run times on many-core GPU's in the strong-scaling limit.

As an example, such simulations are frequently used to elucidate the complex reaction dynamics exhibited by solid catalysts and predict macroscopic performance metrics, such as activity and selectivity. However, the length- and time-scales accessible by sequential KMC implementations are limited, and handling lattices with millions of sites has been prohibitive due to large memory requirements and long simulation times. Domain decomposition approaches could address these limitations, but they require sophisticated algorithms for conflict resolution at the boundaries between subdomains. Jefferson’s Time-Warp algorithm addresses this challenge via rollbacks and re-simulations which correct any and all causality violations arising transiently during simulation. Thus, the exact dynamics of the chemical master equation are finally reproduced.    
In this work, we have coupled the Time-Warp algorithm with the Graph-Theoretical KMC framework enabling the handling of complex adsorbate lateral interactions and reaction events within large lattices. This approach has been implemented in our general-purpose KMC software Zacros, and has been validated and benchmarked for efficiency in model systems as well as realistic chemistries. This work makes Zacros the first-of-its-kind general-purpose KMC code with distributed parallelisation capability to study heterogeneous catalysts.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75497' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1146)' class='star'><span class='star1146'>&star;</span></a> Pia Stammer  <span id='bitlink-3527'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3527)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3527' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3527)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Efficient Solution of the Linear Boltzmann Equation for Radiation Therapy Using the Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation</b><br />Pia Stammer<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-251.html'>Efficient Numerical Frameworks for Kinetic And Related Models - Part II of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Computational methods in radiation therapy require a discretization of the six-dimensional phase space, composed of energy, spatial position and direction of flight. This prohibits fine numerical discretizations which are essential for the construction of accurate treatment plans.      We use a dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) of the particle density to evolve the solution of the continuous slowing down approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation on a low-rank manifold in time. Here the energy is treated as a pseudo-time and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt the rank in energy. The transport equation is split into collided and uncollided particles through a collision source method. Uncollided particles are described analytically, guaranteeing low computational costs, whereas collided particles are represented by a low-rank solution. The resulting method is more efficient concerning both run-time and memory than conventional radiation transport solvers and agrees well with conventional deterministic solvers as well as state-of-the-art Monte Carlo codes.     We further extend our model from electron to the more clinically relevant proton transport, which typically requires finer discretizations due to the extremely forward-peaked scattering and sharp peak in the energy deposition curve. We show that DLRA is well-suited for proton dose computations, already at significantly lower rank than required for electrons.

These problems are often ill-posed, and even with linear forward models, the rank-deficient forward matrices may only be implicitly available through computationally demanding simulators. Typically, some of these challenges can be addressed via regularization, but this biases inference and thus affects UQ guarantees. Thus, standard statistical solutions to these types of problems are often either intractable, unreliable or fail to use relevant information. We propose that some of these challenges can be handled by simply incorporating physical constraints, but this approach leads to challenges of its own. In this talk, I present optimization-based confidence intervals related to the strict bounds interval methodology, addressing some of the aforementioned challenges by incorporating physical constraints. In particular, I present the intervals through the lens of the log-likelihood ratio, allowing connections to constrained inference.

Because of the many wrappers and variants, a user can use the high performance library from almost any programming language. However, the package itself is still written in Fortran.    
Even Fortran enthousiasts must admit that it is less than ideal for writing a large software package. Instead of being another wrapper, T-LAPACK aims to be a complete rewrite of LAPACK in c++ using templates. C++ has major advantages over Fortran. Firstly, routines no longer need to be replicated to support different argument types. This eliminates a major source of bugs and inconsistencies. Secondly, there are better developer tools. Not only is it easier to configure debuggers, formatters and static code checkers for c++, but compiling Fortran code can also be difficult on some platforms like Apple silicon. Lastly, templates make it easier to support special storage formats like banded or even distributed storage.    
This talk will discuss some design decisions, show some major advantages of using templates and finally we will show an overview of what has already been implemented in T-LAPACK.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75649' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(176)' class='star'><span class='star176'>&star;</span></a> Sonja Steffensen  <span id='bitlink-3532'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3532)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3532' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3532)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Discrete-Dynamic Multilevel Gas Market Model</b><br />Sonja Steffensen<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-39.html'>Recent Advances in Stochastic Optimization and Computational Game Theory - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75255' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(949)' class='star'><span class='star949'>&star;</span></a> David Stein  <span id='bitlink-3533'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3533)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3533' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3533)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Self-Organization of Microtubules Through Hydrodynamic Interactions Drives Robust and Oscillatory Rotational Flows</b><br />David Stein<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-207.html'>Numerical Simulation of Bio-Inspired Fluid-Structure Interaction - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>The piconewton forces generated by microtubules polymerizing against the cell cortex or other artificial boundaries are sufficient to deform long microtubules. When microtubules are sparse, their deformations are disordered, characterized by high-frequency buckling and inducing only localized flows. When many microtubules are present the nature of the microtubule deformations and induced flows can change dramatically, giving rise to long-range order and coherent flows. Using a combination of experiments, large-scale simulations of microtubules interacting hydrodynamically through a viscous fluid, and a coarse-grained theory for dense beds of filaments, we elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the self-organization of microtubule ensembles and their subsequent generation of rotation in artificially confined asters in Xenopus Laevis extract.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75518' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1134)' class='star'><span class='star1134'>&star;</span></a> Joao Steinstraesser  <span id='bitlink-3534'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3534)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3534' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3534)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Towards Exponential Semi-Lagrangian Parallel-in-Time Methods for the Shallow Water Equations on the Rotating Sphere</b><br />Joao Steinstraesser<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-249.html'>Parallel-in-Time Algorithms: Performance and Real-World Applications - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>The hyperbolic nature and the development of small-scale spatial features in mathematical models for atmospheric circulation constitute major challenges for parallel-in-time (PinT) numerical simulations in climate modeling and numerical weather prediction. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop coarse time stepping schemes that are able to improve the stability and convergence of PinT methods. In this work, we explore the application of semi-Lagrangian exponential methods for the two- and multilevel parallel-in-time simulation of the shallow water equations (SWE) on the rotating sphere, using Parareal and MGRIT. As a main feature, exponential methods (e.g. ETDRK) solve exactly the linear terms of the governing equations, and their recently proposed semi-Lagrangian version (SL-ETDRK) was shown to be more stable in the serial integration of the SWE on the plane. We then consider these methods on the sphere and in the PinT context. We perform stability studies on a linearized ODE which indicate that Parareal and MGRIT using ETDRK and SL-ETDRK as coarse schemes have improved stability properties compared to the use of the well-known SL-SI-SETTLS method, which turns out to be highly unstable in the PinT framework despite of its successful application in serial simulations of atmospheric circulation. Numerical tests of standard benchmarks confirm that exponential schemes, notably in the semi-Lagrangian framework, are promising choices for parallel-in-time integration.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75575' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(907)' class='star'><span class='star907'>&star;</span></a> Ingo Steldermann  <span id='bitlink-3535'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3535)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3535' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3535)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Transient Velocity Profiles in Complex Shallow Flow</b><br />Ingo Steldermann<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-199.html'>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>Shallow water models are successfully used for simulating geophysical flows like river floods, tsunamis, sediment transport, or debris flows. One important characteristic in all these applications is the underlying material closure, e.g. a Newtonian fluid for water. In order to model more complex fluids like snow or debris as granular material, different closure relations are required. The $\mu(I)$-rheology is one such closure for granular flow that has already been applied successfully in depth-averaged models.    
An extension of classical shallow water models, which typically require a constant or predefined vertical velocity profile, is introduced in the shallow moment method. This method retains transient information about the vertical flow profile using a finite Legendre expansion to resolve the vertical velocity with time-dependent coefficients. The shallow moment approach allows to include more information systematically and generates a hierarchy of models that in the limit, recover the reference equations before depth-averaging and are therefore vertically fully resolved.  However, even a low number of basis functions significantly increases the predictive power of the model compared to classical shallow water systems.    
The shallow moment method has mostly been studied for Newtonian fluids. Therefore, this talk will focus on current developments and challenges in modeling complex fluids within the shallow moment framework.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75509' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1840)' class='star'><span class='star1840'>&star;</span></a> Robert R.

In this paper, we introduce PDE-LEARN, a novel PDE-discovery algorithm that can identify PDEs directly from noisy, limited measurements of a physical system governed by a hidden PDE. PDE-LEARN uses a Rational Neural Network, $U$, to approximate the system response function and a sparse, trainable vector $\xi$ to characterize the hidden PDE. Our approach couples the training of $U$ and $\xi$ using a specially designed loss function that (1) makes $U$ approximate the system response function, (2) encapsulates the fact that $U$ satisfies a hidden PDE that $\xi$ characterizes, and (3) promotes sparsity in $\xi$ using ideas from iteratively reweighted least-squares. This approach yields a robust algorithm that applies to many physical systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of PDE-LEARN by identifying several PDEs from noisy and limited measurements.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75886' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(694)' class='star'><span class='star694'>&star;</span></a> Ari Stern  <span id='bitlink-3537'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3537)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3537' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3537)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Introduction to DEC and FEEC</b><br />Ari Stern<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-153.html'>Exterior Calculus in Numerical Computing, Modeling, and Simulation - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC) and Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) are two closely related frameworks for structure-preserving numerical modeling and computation.

These methods possess good stability properties all while offering computational savings over implicit methods for some problems where efficient preconditioners are not available. We will discuss the application of variable time stepping exponential methods of EPIRK-type to chemical combustion problems. These variable time-stepping schemes leverage the KIOPS algorithm to quickly and accurately approximate the exponential-like $\varphi$-functions which constitute the main computational expense of exponential integrators. Combustion problems are notorious for stiffness that arises from both the chemical kinetics portion of the models as well as transport mechanisms driving the process. We demonstrate that even straight-forward, i.e. out-of-the-box, application of exponential methods to these systems yields performance comparable to the implicit methods of CVODE (LLNL) and TrBDF2 (SNL).  We carry out a number of experiments using GRI, NHeptane, NButane, NDodecane, and Hydrogen combustion mechanisms to compare performance of exponential and implicit methods over the course of ignition at a single point. Our numerical studies include both overall comparison of the performance of the integrators as well as detailed analysis of underlying computations with Krylov-based techniques.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75619' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1282)' class='star'><span class='star1282'>&star;</span></a> Panos Stinis  <span id='bitlink-3539'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3539)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3539' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3539)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Spiking Neural Network Representation of Partial Differential Equation Evolution Maps</b><br />Panos Stinis<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-282.html'>Codesigning a Probabilistic Computing Future: Applications and Algorithms - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>We present a novel method based on Spiking Neural Networks for the construction of numerical integrators of ordinary (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDEs).

In this work we study a new method of this type, called a time-domain preconditioner. Given an indefinite linear system, a matrix recurrence relation is constructed, such that in the limit of infinitely many time steps the exact discrete solution is obtained. Using a large, finite number of time steps, an approximate solution is obtained. To improve the convergence, the process is used as a preconditioner for GMRES, and the time-harmonic forcing term is multiplied by a smooth window function. In this talk we will discuss in particular a comparison with other time-domain solvers, as well as some recent performance result using graphics processing units (GPUs).

Choosing a mesh scale that is too fine can lead to slow convergence or an intractable problem size. Alternatively, too coarse a mesh scale and features of the PDE will go unresolved, yielding an incorrect solution. Methods of numerical homogenization address these by creating an effective model defined at the macro scale by propagating relevant information from the fine space to the coarse space. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art homogenization approaches are sensitive to individual PDE configurations. We propose machine learning methods to construct effective models that are more robust and efficient. Our approach investigates linear and nonlinear models with $L_1$ sparsity enforcing penalties on heterogeneous PDEs without relying on separable scales or periodicity.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75834' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1014)' class='star'><span class='star1014'>&star;</span></a> Alexander Strang  <span id='bitlink-3543'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3543)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3543' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3543)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Varying Map Estimators with Varying Assumptions in Sparsity Promoting Gaussian Hierarchical Models</b><br />Alexander Strang<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-222.html'>Sparsity-Promoting Bayesian Inverse Problems</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, like all Bayesian methods, depends on prior assumptions. These assumptions are often chosen to promote specific features in the recovered estimate like sparsity. The form of the chosen prior determines the shape of the posterior distribution, thus the behavior of the estimator, and the complexity of the associated optimization problem. Here, we consider a family of Gaussian hierarchical models with generalized gamma hyperpriors designed to promote sparsity in linear inverse problems. By varying the hyperparameters we can move continuously between priors that act as smoothed $\ell_p$ penalties with flexible $p$, smoothing, and scale. We then introduce methods for tracking MAP solution paths along paths through hyper parameter space. Path following allows a user to explore the space of possible MAP solutions under varying assumptions and to test the robustness and sensitivity of solutions to changes in the prior assumptions. By tracing paths from a convex region to a non-convex region, the user can find local minimizers in strongly sparsity promoting regimes that are consistent with a convex relaxation of the same problem derived using a consistent family of prior assumptions. We show experimentally that these solutions are less error prone than direct optimization of the non-convex problem.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75540' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(158)' class='star'><span class='star158'>&star;</span></a> Maria Strazzullo  <span id='bitlink-3544'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3544)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3544' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3544)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Model Order Reduction for Parametric Optimal Control Problems in Space-Time Formulation</b><br />Maria Strazzullo<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-35.html'>Model Order Reduction in Space and Time: Challenges and Opportunities - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we deal with optimal control problems governed by parabolic partial differential equations employing the certified reduced basis method. Specifically, we rely on a new easy-to-compute error estimator that guarantees a rigorous and efficient bound to the problem variables. We first introduce the space-time formulation for optimal control. To solve the space-time optimality system faster, we use a Greedy method. In the talk, we propose some insights on the derivation of such an error estimator. We test the performances of the proposed strategy on a physical parametrized distributed optimal control problem and a boundary optimal control problem with physical and geometrical parameters.  The obtained results are compared to previously proposed bounds based expensive on the computation (or approximation) of the optimality system inf-sup constant. The comparison regards reliability and computational costs [M. Strazzullo, F. Ballarin, G. Rozza, &#8220;A Certified Reduced Basis Method for Linear Parametrized Parabolic Optimal Control Problems in Space-Time Formulation', submitted, 2021].  Moreover, the findings hold for steady problems, too: we will show some novel applications to varying boundary control, i.e. problems where the parameter changes the portion of the boundary where the control acts highlighting the pros and cons of the strategy in such a scenario.

Many of these challenges stem from the heterogeneity of the hardware. On the processing side, the main source of computer performance is accelerators (e.g., general-purpose graphics cards) that are combined with CPUs (which in turn already contain a variety of arithmetic/logic units and vector processing engines). On the memory side, not only are cache hierarchies deepening, but the diversity of technologies and devices in the overall memory and storage subsystems is growing: from fast SRAM to tape, almost every type of memory and storage technology in existence is in use.  HPC users should be aware of the heterogeneity of modern system architectures, but should not be left alone in the face of it. Ideally, most of the hardware complexity should be handled by the middleware and software stack, while interfaces to applications become hardware agnostic and standardised. This approach facilitates the long-term sustainability of applications, as well as their portability across platforms. However, today we are far from this situation. To improve it, the SEA projects are developing a software stack with the functionality and tools needed to cope with heterogeneous resources and share them more dynamically between users.

We theoretically prove and empirically show that, due to the formulation, solutions of linear, non-linear, forward, and inverse PDE problems can be efficiently and numerically stable computed. Moreover,  under the same formulation, optimal domain decomposition for approximating discontinuous shocks can be given.    
We investigate the properties and performance of two kinds of variational solvers:   Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)  and Polynomial (spectral)  Surrogate Models (PSMs). While already linear PDEs result in   non-linear and non-convex optimization problems when addressed with PINNs, the corresponding PSM optimization problems maintain linear and convex.    By computing the PDE losses on a generalization of classic Gauss-Legendre cubatures, termed Sobolev cubatures, we can show that  PSMs models are as flexible as PINNs for general (inverse) non-linear problems, with several orders of magnitude of better accuracy and computational efficiency, opening up the discussion regarding When are PINNs necessary?  How can we enhance existing methods with hybrid formulations?     
Our approach is intended to be a unifying framework of the classic numerical methods, together with the novel machine learning ones, exploiting the best of each field.  	    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75557' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1650)' class='star'><span class='star1650'>&star;</span></a> Amit Subrahmanya  <span id='bitlink-3547'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3547)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3547' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3547)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Constraint Preserving Particle Flow Filters</b><br />Amit Subrahmanya<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-365.html'>Simulation-Based UQ Methods - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>Data assimilation can be thought of as a Bayesian inverse problem that combines noisy observations of reality with uncertain model dynamics. Flow based assimilation methods evolve the samples from an uninformed prior to posterior that is informed by the observation via a defined stochastic differential equation. But what happens when the model states are constrained to be on a physical manifold? Think of a pendulum with a constant cord length. Standard filters have a minimal ability to strongly enforce these physical constraints. To this end, we formulate a flow based filter that treats the assimilation as an evolution of a stochastic differential algebraic equation (SDAE). We also specifically discuss the time evolution of the said SDAE.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75801' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(580)' class='star'><span class='star580'>&star;</span></a> Aarthi Subramanian  <span id='bitlink-3548'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3548)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3548' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3548)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Disturbance Rejection of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Stochastic Systems : A Disturbance Observer Based Approach</b><br />Aarthi Subramanian<br />Thursday, March 2 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-127.html'>Model-Based Optimal Experimental Design - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Disturbance rejection of interval type fuzzy nonlinear  stochastic systems with asynchronous premise variables is proposed.

The construction of a fuzzy feedback controller with asynchronous premise variables ensures that the membership functions of the premise are not necessarily the same as in interval-type fuzzy systems. To guarantee the stochastic stability of the closed loop fuzzy system, a new adequate condition is constructed through the method of linear matrix inequalities by integrating the infinitesimal operator and the selection of appropriate Lyapunouv-Krasovskii functional candidate.

The cascading impact of such attacks is often overlooked, even though it is well known that cascades are one of the primary causes of large-scale blackouts. This paper explores modifications of the power network's transmission line flow thresholds as candidates for adversarial attacks, which are undetectable as long as they don't affect line flows at equilibrium. This forms the basis of a black-box function in a Bayesian optimization procedure, where the goal is to find line threshold settings that maximize cascade damage. Notably, the proposed method is agnostic to the choice of underlying cascade simulator. Extensive experiments conducted using a recently developed quasi-steady state cascade simulator reveal that, contrary to what one might expect, the most restrictive thresholds do not necessarily produce the most damaging cascades. More surprisingly, even in a limited resource setting where attacks are resource-constrained, one can find attacks that produce cascades comparable in severity to those found when there are no resource constraints.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75800' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1149)' class='star'><span class='star1149'>&star;</span></a> Kosuke Sugita  <span id='bitlink-3550'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3550)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3550' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3550)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Scattering Matrix Computations for Integrated Photonics</b><br />Kosuke Sugita<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-252.html'>Fast Methods for Integral Equations and Their Applications in Forward and Inverse Problems - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>We present an accurate and efficient numerical method for large-scale simulations of integrated photonic devices.  The governing equations for light propagating through these devices are the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions, and Maxwell’s equations in three dimensions. The problem is numerically challenging to simulate owing to the size of the object as measured in wavelengths of the propagating modes – the devices are typically of millimeter scale, while the wavelength of the propagating modes is on the micrometer scale.  This difficulty results in a large number of degrees of freedom required to discretize the problem which in turn leads to prohibitively large simulation times for each iteration of the design loop.  We present a divide-and-conquer approach to enable computer-aided design of photonic devices which relies on the devices consisting of simple function modules with straight waveguides albeit with different numbers of input and output channels. Since each component only supports a small number of propagating modes, we construct scattering matrices which completely characterize the input/output behavior of these components using state-of-art boundary integral equation methods coupled with high-order quadrature rules, and the recursively compressed inverse preconditioning  method.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75578' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1826)' class='star'><span class='star1826'>&star;</span></a> Mina Sun  <span id='bitlink-3551'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3551)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3551' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3551)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>How Good Is Approximately Solving Graph Problems As Width-Constrained Positive Linear Programs in Parallel?</b><br />Mina Sun<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-402.html'>Emerging Techniques for Scalable Graph Processing - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Graph problems, like those of s-t path and densest subgraph, are frequently employed to solve a wide range of applied problems. A number of these graph problems can be expressed either approximately or exactly as a width-constrained positive linear program (LP), and this formulation may also admit further approximation by using low-hop emulators or hopsets. Furthermore, many of these problems can be solved with a $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation factor in a highly parallel way. In recent years, novel algorithms using these techniques have been developed and analyzed theoretically, but their practical implications are not well understood in the literature.    
In this talk, we will explore some of the practical implications of these algorithms for large-scale distributed graph problems. In particular, we have implemented and analyzed the parallel $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate with $\tilde{O}(n)$ parallel depth s-t path algorithm from Andoni, Stein, and Zhong (STOC 2020) and the Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) method from Mahoney et. al (ICALP 2016) that finds a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution to a positive LP in $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ time (this is a joint work with Caleb Ju and Serif Yesil.) We show that, for certain types of problems, the novel methods trades vastly superior performance for a small decrease in accuracy, while for others the gains are insubstantial. We also present some implementation-specific enhancements.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75882' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(968)' class='star'><span class='star968'>&star;</span></a> Hari Sundar  <span id='bitlink-3552'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3552)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3552' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3552)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data-Sparse Formats for Improving the Scalability of Seismic Imaging</b><br />Hari Sundar<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-211.html'>Computational Challenges in Wave Theory: Methods and Applications - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75522' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1842)' class='star'><span class='star1842'>&star;</span></a> Arvind Sundaram  <span id='bitlink-3553'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3553)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3553' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3553)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Randomized Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Automatic Differentiation</b><br />Arvind Sundaram<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-406.html'>Forward Alternatives to Back-Propagation in ML and Science</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Recent research has shown the power of randomized dimensionality reduction techniques in creating accuracy preserving reduction of general nonlinear models.

The core difficulties in the derivation of meaningful optimality conditions and development of provably convergent numerical optimization methods lie in the inherent degeneracy of the constraint set, which can often be rewritten as a mixed complementarity problem.  We consider a class of MPECs in which the equilibrium constraint is modeled by an elliptic variational inequality subject to random inputs. Due to the resulting presence of uncertainty in the objective function $\mathcal{J}$, we model our risk preference by considering composite objective functions of the type $\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{J}(z)) + \rho(z)$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a numerical surrogate for risk and $\rho(z)$ is the cost of the decision $z$.  We propose to derive optimality conditions using an adaptive penalty technique, which can later be linked to a function-space based optimization method. In doing so, we highlight a number of unforeseen challenges, not unique to the infinite-dimensional setting, which give rise several open questions. Finally, we conclude with some initial numerical studies, in which we make use of a path-following stochastic approximation algorithm with a variance reduction step that periodically makes use of the full gradient.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75861' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1620)' class='star'><span class='star1620'>&star;</span></a> James C.

We achieve a substantial reduction in the number of parameters needed to visualize, describe and predict complex systems, but some topological properties of LDMs can hinder their practical application. For instance, ROMs often require training a nonlinear regression model to predict physical quantities of interest from the reduced representation, and accurate reconstruction of minor species as well as projected source terms (both of which can exhibit large gradients) is challenging. In this talk, we explore the challenges that remain in ROM of turbulent combustion. We focus on the topological issues that the LDMs present. We discuss our recent advances in characterizing manifold quality, generating improved manifold topologies and improving nonlinear regression performance. We demonstrate novel quantitative tools for characterizing the quality of LDMs from the perspective of non-uniqueness and steep gradients in the physical quantities of interest. We show applications of the manifold assessment tools in optimization algorithms that yield improved manifolds.

That is, by refining the grid, ever more accurate approximate solutions are obtained. This property is the sole guarantee that a numerical solution can be trusted to track the true solution. For consistent approximations of linear PDEs, the celebrated Lax-Richtmyer Theorem, states the equivalence of stability, e.g. a single $L^2$ bound, and convergence.    
One may nurture the hope that a non-linear bound, such as a bounded entropy, has the same effect for non-linear conservation laws. Unfortunately, this is generally not the case. In this talk, I will discuss why proving convergence (to any reasonably defined solution) for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is such a challenging problem and show that it is a consequence of the derivation of the equations. Drawing from these insights, I will present an alternative Navier-Stokes model with the same modelling capabilities as the standard Navier-Stokes system (and point to references where it has been validated). Furthermore, and without any a priori stability assumptions, I will outline a proof showing that the numerical solutions to a finite-volume scheme converges to a weak solution. That is, I will have demonstrated the existence of weak solutions to the alternative Navier-Stokes system.

Optimization of simulator parameters therefore has a need for derivative-free optimizers. As the simulations are expensive, sample efficiency is critical. Simulators often have many detailed outputs which get lumped into a single objective value. Avoiding all that loss of structure (e.g. by retaining a least squares structure) can greatly reduce the number of evaluations till convergence. Sioux Technologies has developed the composite derivative-free solver LIMOLS which has a clean interface for exploiting a plethora of composite structures and is very sample efficient as a result. We illustrate 10x faster convergence than Nelder-Mead on an application of modelling a bending machine and matching simulated shapes with measured shapes through a Haussdorf metric / Iterative closest point computation.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75861' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1655)' class='star'><span class='star1655'>&star;</span></a> Katarzyna Swirydowicz  <span id='bitlink-3558'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3558)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3558' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3558)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Random Sketching for Improving the Performance of Gram-Schmidt Algorithm on Modern Architectures</b><br />Katarzyna Swirydowicz<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-366.html'>New Algorithmic Developments for Heterogeneous Computing Environments - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Randomized Gram-Schmidt was introduces in 2022 in a paper authored by Oleg Balabanov and Laura Grigori.

One particular example is the flow around a stalled airfoil where linear analysis identifies two important frequencies: the vortex shedding in the wake and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the shear layer. Although the frequencies are a good match with experimental data obtained from particle image velocimetry (PIV), the structures computed from linear analysis do not agree with those computed directly from the PIV data. The discrepancy can be explained by the limitations of the linear analysis which only accounts for energy exchange mechanisms between the mean and fluctuations. Inter-scale energy exchanges are neglected resulting in structures which extend too far into the wake. In this talk, the nonlinear energy exchanges are unravelled by isolating the key triadic interactions underpinning the flow. In addition, the regions of the flow where these nonlinear energy exchanges take place are identified in order to develop suitable eddy viscosity models that mimic nonlinear energy transfer.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75390' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1454)' class='star'><span class='star1454'>&star;</span></a> Sandor Szabo  <span id='bitlink-3560'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3560)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3560' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3560)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Clique Based Algorithm for Scheduling Coupled Tasks with Delay</b><br />Sandor Szabo<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-320.html'>Graph Theoretic Methods in Scientific Computing - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>The clique search algorithms has improved to such an extent that   today we may compute clique numbers of highly non-trial size graphs.   These algorithm are even more efficient in the particular case when   one wants to locate $k$-cliques in $k$-partite graphs.   In this work we single out a scheduling problem in which tasks are   coupled and the time delay between the first and second member of   the couple is fixed by technological constraints.    
We will show that this scheduling problem can be reduced to the   question to decide if a tactically constructed $k$-partite auxiliary   graph contains a $k$-clique.   The scheduling problems can be reformulated as an integer linear program   and can be handled using powerful solvers.   We argue that if the clique version of the scheduling problem is not   overly large and the existing clique solvers can handle it, then the   clique approach has certain advantages.   These are the following.  The clique solver does not use floating point arithmetic and so it is   rounding error free.

We will point out that before submitting the auxiliary graph to a   clique solver it is useful to carry out various inspections in order   to delete nodes and edges of the graph.

While harvesting energy from wind or solar radiation has its own   limitations in terms of accessibility of the energy source, there arises   a necessity of optimization of the harvesting process. The amount of   energy that can be produced depends on the weather conditions which are   a result of complex multiscale phenomena in the atmosphere.  We present a digital twin for renewable energy sources, a comprehensive   tool named RES for modeling fine-grained weather conditions for wind and   photovoltaic farms and providing estimates of energy production. The   framework introduces a multiscale approach by using two models for   different scales: WRF and EULAG. With both models coupled, it is   possible to perform complex simulations in HPC environment, tailored   towards renewable energy sources. Great level of details significantly   increases the quality of the digital twin and its energy production   estimations done at the post-processing stage.  Described framework has been introduced to one of the largest Polish   energy operators. As the operator owns multiple wind farms, their energy   production estimation is detailed with created digital twin of each. RES   is also used by the operator to create a digital twin of energy   infrastructure in order to predict its failures due to upcoming wind   gusts, excessive temperatures or icing.

Efficient implementation of these operators is therefore crucial for operational implementations.  Diffusion-based correlation operators are popular in ocean data assimilation, but can require a large number of serial matrix-vector product. A parallel-in-time formulation removes this requirement, and offers the opportunity to exploit modern computer architectures. High quality preconditioners for the parallel-in-time approach are well-known, but impossible to apply in practice for the high-dimensional problems that occur in oceanography. In this talk we consider a nested preconditioning approach which retains many of the beneficial properties of the ideal analytic preconditioner while remaining affordable in terms of memory and computational resource.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75645' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(53)' class='star'><span class='star53'>&star;</span></a> Maria Luisa Taccari  <span id='bitlink-3566'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3566)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3566' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3566)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>DeepOnet for Sub-Surface Flow Problems</b><br />Maria Luisa Taccari<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-12.html'>Neural Network Solvers for Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>Groundwater numerical models support the critical decision of issuing and reviewing permits such as water abstraction licences and enable forecasting the impact of land use and climate change on groundwater resources. They typically use control volumes (cells) for solving the discretized groundwater flow equation. As high spatial and temporal resolution are generally required, the use in supporting planning and mitigation policies is often limited by computational cost. In this work, we explore the use of neural operator surrogates to mitigate this expense. We address this challenge by learning the distribution of hydraulic head in a confined aquifer with one or multiple pumping wells, which act as forcing terms on Darcy's law. The heterogeneous aquifer is composed of various lenses of fine to medium sand, each with a different hydraulic conductivity. One or multiple wells are randomly placed in the domain and deep operator networks (DeepONet) learn the mapping from the hydraulic conductivity field and the forcing terms to the resulting groundwater head. Several application examples are deployed here with the aim of revealing how to best formulate the learning tasks for constructing a computationally inexpensive emulator for the steady-state and transient solutions of heterogeneous aquifers.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75203' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2067)' class='star'><span class='star2067'>&star;</span></a> Maria Luisa Taccari  <span id='bitlink-3567'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3567)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3567' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3567)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Machine learning for fast and reliable groundwater surrogate models</b><br />Maria Luisa Taccari<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-428.html'>Computational Engineering (BGCE) Student Paper Prize - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D302<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75494' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(162)' class='star'><span class='star162'>&star;</span></a> Tommaso Taddei  <span id='bitlink-3568'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3568)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3568' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3568)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Registration-Based Model Reduction of Advection-Dominated PDEs with Spatio-Parameter Adaptivity</b><br />Tommaso Taddei<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-36.html'>Model Order Reduction in Space and Time: Challenges and Opportunities - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>We present a nonlinear registration-based model reduction procedure for rapid and reliable solution of parameterized two-dimensional steady conservation laws. This class of problems is challenging for model reduction techniques due to the presence of nonlinear terms in the equations and also due to the presence of parameter-dependent sharp gradient regions that cannot be adequately represented through linear approximation spaces. Our approach builds on the following ingredients: (i) a general (i.e., independent of the underlying equation) registration procedure for the computation of a parametric mapping that tracks moving features of the solution field; (ii) an hyper-reduced least-squares Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order model for the rapid and reliable estimation of the solution field; (iii) a greedy procedure driven by a residual-based error indicator for efficient exploration of the parameter domain; and (iv) an adaptive mesh refinement technique for the definition of an accurate discretization for all parameter values.

Model order reduction methods in which the problem is (approximately) solved in a carefully chosen subspace of the high-dimensional discretization space have been developed to tackle such problems. However, for many large-scale problems, and especially problems that exhibit multiscale features, full order solves are not affordable in a reasonable time frame. Localized model order reduction methods decompose the global computational domain into subdomains, build local reduced models from solutions of the partial differential equation (PDE) on the subdomains, and use some coupling to compute a global reduced approximation. For the local model order reduction methods that we will present in this talk we can control the global approximation error even if the global computational domain is unknown when the local reduced models are constructed, facilitating a LEGO brick like assembly of the global computational domain, imperative for many applications such as digital twins. While there has been a significant progress in recent years for the construction of local reduced models for linear PDEs, very few results have been obtained so far for nonlinear PDEs. In this talk, we will show how randomized methods and their probabilistic numerical analysis can be exploited for the construction and numerical analysis of local reduced models for nonlinear PDEs.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75797' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(940)' class='star'><span class='star940'>&star;</span></a> Tanya V.

Recent advancements in computational linear algebra allows efficient approximation of the $\varphi$-functions by exploiting the equivalence with a linear ordinary differential equation. The resulting adaptive Krylov methods can be very efficient in serial when little or no prior knowledge of the spectrum of $A$ is available. However, in parallel, communication is of paramount importance in the formulation of methods for distributed architectures. Arnoldi iteration in Krylov subspace methods is a computational bottleneck because global communication for normalization and inner products is needed at each Arnoldi step. We aim to improve the scalability of exponential integrators by using a low-synchronization Post-Modern Arnoldi method in conjunction with higher-order adaptive sub-stepping techniques via control theory. The resulting orthogonalization algorithm has an accuracy comparable to modified Gram-Schmidt yet better suited for distributed architecture as there is only 1 global communication per iteration. We present geophysical based numerical experiments which validate that reducing global communication and having a smoother sub-step sequence in the adaptivity lead to better parallel scalability and reduce the computational complexity of the adaptive Krylov methods, which in turn improve the performance of exponential integrators.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75515' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(74)' class='star'><span class='star74'>&star;</span></a> William T.

The exponential growth in computational complexity often challenges a grid-based approach to modeling the Boltzmann equation as the dimensionality grows. To mitigate such issues, scalable low-rank tensor decomposition techniques have recently been developed with applications to high-dimensional PDEs. Despite the remarkable progress made in the community, low-rank structures in the phase-space are not evident in realistic engineering systems with complex geometries (e.g., electric propulsions systems and fusion reactors), where discontinuities, shocks, complex boundary conditions, and material-dependent physics (e.g., collisions, fusion reactions, ionization/excitation, charge-exchange processes) pose formidable challenges. In this talk, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm where quad-tree adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is applied in real space while a low-rank approximation is applied in the velocity space. The AMR algorithm efficiently handles challenges pertaining to complex structures in real space, while the low-rank formulation targets dimensionality challenges in the velocity space. We present preliminary results on the new algorithm applied to challenging multi-dimensional gas kinetics problems.

Here we focus mostly on $C^0$-matching multi-patch constructions to represent complex geometries. In this case, the global continuity for the basis functions is usually only $C^0$. To obtain exactly $C^1$-smooth isogeometric functions, special constructions need to be employed. It could be shown in [Collin, Sangalli, Takacs. Analysis-suitable $G^1$ multi-patch parametrizations for $C^1$ isogeometric spaces. CAGD, 2016] that generic, $C^0$-matching multi-patch parametrizations do not allow $C^1$-smooth isogeometric discretizations of sufficient approximation power. Depending on the patch interior continuity, approximation orders are drastically reduced or convergence may be completely prevented. To circumvent this issue one can increase the polynomial degree locally or relax the smoothness conditions. Two such approaches are developed in [Weinm\"uller, Takacs. An approximate $C^1$ multi-patch space for isogeometric analysis with a comparison to Nitsche's method. CMAME, 2022] and [Takacs, Toshniwal.

These methods aim at providing a diagnostic suit, which is able to notify the operators on the occurrence of faults as well as on the necessity to undertake possible actions in real-time. Although such strategies may prove significantly more efficient than traditional time-based maintenance approaches, the challenge of implementation consists in the requirement for more sophisticated data processing techniques that will allow to distill the measured information and extract a set of robust and condition-sensitive indicators.    
This contribution is focused on the fusion on data-driven and physics-based modeling techniques, in order to devise a computationally efficient framework for online assimilation of output-only vibration measurements into the virtual instances of monitored systems, towards the materialization of real-time Digita Twins (DTs). The major challenges to be addressed in this respect are associated with the methodological tools and the modeling-related aspects, which comprise the uncertainty and complexity related to global model-based approaches, the nonlinear effects occurring on slender components, the system variability induced by the changing environmental and operational conditions and the existence of structural flaws.

However, to perform a predictive phase-field simulation is remained still computationally challenge in practice, because numerical solutions exhibit mesh dependency issue. As a result, the quantitative phase field modeling is limited to very small spatial scales and low Peclet number regimes. Recent advances in deep neural networks revealed that the direct differentiation of neural networks makes it possible to solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a computational complexity and accuracy competitive to classic grid-based approaches like finite different and finite element methods. In physics-informed neural networks methods, instead of using existing data, the physics of problem is directly included into the training phase and the neural-network is trained without any required data. This work communicates results on the solution of PDEs corresponding to the quantitative phase-field modeling of pure elements solidification. Different network architectures and ways of training on the accuracy of results are studied. The results reveal that this method competes with existing mesh-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we can train the network in a small space-time domain, and then can solve the corresponding PDEs with the already trained network in larger spatial domains and longer times.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75604' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(912)' class='star'><span class='star912'>&star;</span></a> Maurizio Tavelli  <span id='bitlink-3578'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3578)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3578' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3578)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Asymptotic Preserving IMEX Schemes for the Shallow Water Equations on Unstructured Meshes</b><br />Maurizio Tavelli<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-200.html'>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part II of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>We propose a novel numerical method for the solution of the shallow water equations in different regimes of the Froude number making use of general polygonal meshes. The fluxes of the governing equations are split such that advection and acoustic-gravity sub-systems are derived, hence separating slow and fast phenomena. This splitting allows the nonlinear convective fluxes to be discretized explicitly in time, while retaining an implicit time marching for the acoustic-gravity terms. Consequently, the novel schemes are particularly well suited in the low Froude limit of the model, since no numerical viscosity is added in the implicit solver. Besides, stability follows from a milder CFL condition which is based only on the advection speed and not on the celerity. High order time accuracy is achieved using the family of semi-implicit IMEX Runge-Kutta schemes, while high order in space is granted relying on two discretizations: (i) a cell-centered finite volume (FV) scheme for the nonlinear convective contribution on the polygonal cells; (ii) a staggered discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for the solution of the linear system associated to the implicit discretization of the pressure sub-system. The novel schemes are proved to be Asymptotic Preserving (AP) and well-balanced by construction. Accuracy and robustness are then validated against a set of benchmark test cases with Froude numbers ranging in the interval $\Fr \approx [10^{-6};5]$.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75510' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(62)' class='star'><span class='star62'>&star;</span></a> Christina G.

However, cut cell meshes can result in extremely small and/or skewed cut elements that severely restrict the maximum stable time step of a simulation. Special discretizations may also be required to ensure that a cut-cell method is energy stable. In this work we prove the L2 stability of state redistribution, a technique for relaxing the CFL condition when small elements are present, and combine it with a provably energy stable high order discontinuous Galerkin formulation for wave propagation problems.

These equations can be written as a linear system for the diffusion velocities with a singular coefficient matrix, the so-called friction matrix, and a right hand side vector containing the driving forces for diffusion.To express the diffusion velocities in terms of mass fraction gradients, we first have to regularize the friction matrix, taking into account the mass flux constraint, and subsequently convert mole fractions to mass fractions. The resulting expressions are substituted in the continuity equations, leading to a coupled system of conservation laws, where the diffusion is expressed in terms of a diffusion matrix.    
To compute numerical solutions of this system, we employ the finite volume method in combination with the system version of the complete flux scheme. The basic idea of this scheme is to compute the numerical flux vector at a cell interface from a local system boundary value problem, thus including the coupling between the constituent equations in the discretization. The scheme has favorable properties, such as conservation of total mass. We will demonstrate the performance of the scheme for some examples.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75551' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1827)' class='star'><span class='star1827'>&star;</span></a> David Tench  <span id='bitlink-3583'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3583)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3583' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3583)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>GraphZeppelin: Linear Sketching for Dynamic Graph Connectivity</b><br />David Tench<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-402.html'>Emerging Techniques for Scalable Graph Processing - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Existing graph stream processing systems must store the graph explicitly in RAM which limits the scale of graphs they can process. The graph semi-streaming literature offers algorithms which avoid this limitation via linear sketching data structures that use small (sublinear) space, but these algorithms have not seen use in practice to date. In this talk I will present GraphZeppelin, a streaming graph system for computing the connected components of a dynamically changing graph. I will show how GraphZeppelin uses linear sketching to efficiently process graphs too large to store explicitly in RAM, and why existing linear sketching algorithms for this and other graph problems fall short in practice. I will show how these sketching techniques scale incredibly well in the the distributed setting, with provably near-optimally low network communication overhead.  Finally, I will discuss what these results mean for the semi-streaming model and what is required for linear sketching algorithms to be practical.

However, a well-known downside of DL-based methods consists in the huge amount of data required, which often hinders their application. Recent works in the scientific machine learning area have demonstrated that the data greed bottleneck can be circumvented by enforcing physical awareness. Indeed, if DL models are enriched with knowledge of the physical laws underlying the phenomenon of interest, they can attain remarkable levels of accuracy even in a small data regime and, moreover, their generalization capabilities can be improved. In this talk, we present a physics-informed model - called ST-RB-DNN - that encodes scattered values of solutions to unsteady parametrized PDEs to the underlying parameter values, leveraging model order reduction techniques. In particular, we employed space-time reduced basis (ST-RB) methods, since they allow for dramatic lightening of the computational burden, by means of dimensionality reduction along both the spatial and the temporal dimensions. For the numerical tests, we consider blood flow - modeled via the Navier-Stokes equations - in different patient-specific 3D geometries. In all cases, the ST-RB-DNN model provides good estimates of the underlying parameter values. Further extensions of this work involve the implementation of RFSI models to account for the vessel wall compliance and of ad hoc boundary conditions to better model coronary flow.

Segmenting the voxels belonging to the LV in magnetic resonance images (MRI) allows the most accurate estimation of the volume of the LV. While deep learning-based approaches for automatic segmentation are achieving good results, those methods lack a proper representation of the uncertainties linked to their predictions. However, when using automatic predictions – especially in critical applications such as medical diagnosis – an accurate description of the attached uncertainties is essential so that medical experts can interfere in case of unreliable predictions.    
In this work, we propose a method to add probabilities to the volume prediction made by any segmentation algorithm. The segmentation algorithm returns a segmentation for the LV for each slice throughout the 3D MRI of the heart. To add uncertainties, we model the volume along the depth of the heart by using a combination of a stochastic differential equation and a separate distribution for the particularly error-prone first and last slices which cut through the cardiac wall. We ensure that the predicted probabilities are bias-free with respect to the deterministic voxel counts of the segmentation algorithm. This approach inherently models asymmetries and incorporates geometric features into the uncertainty. Furthermore, this uncertainty lets us detect images that should be revisited by a medical expert.

This is especially useful when unphysical artifacts such as aliasing error or Gibbs phenomena arise, or when extracting higher accuracy in a numerical solution. As part of this, filters should increase the decay rate of the coefficients away from a discontinuity. Near a shock, filters reduce spurious oscillations.      The motivation of this work is to minimize the size of the region with order one numerical error typically found near a discontinuity, which in turn contributes to enhancing the overall accuracy of a numerical approximation. We propose a novel way to learn filters for discontinuous data while preserving moments. The learned filter is a convolutional neural network, which learns from time-evolved, linearly advected data of different initial condition profiles that include $C^0$ and $C^1$ discontinuities.  We enforce a consistency condition as a hard constraint and maintain polynomial reproduction through a penalty term in the training. In this talk, we will present construction and training aspects of our learned filter along with benchmark tests of the effectiveness of the filter.

The system is modeled by a drift-diffusion equation in one spatial dimension, which describes the temporal evolution of the scalar current density and the distributed electric field in the voltage-biased superlattice. Numerically computed data show that, for some parameter regimes, the dynamics become temporally periodic after a transient: a traveling solitary wave for the electric field cyclically moves from cathode to anode.    
The higher order dynamic mode decomposition is applied to uncover the broad frequency spectrum of the spatio-temporal dynamics driving the transport mechanisms. The purely decaying transient can be isolated from the attractor, which is approximated by considering snapshots in short time intervals. On the other hand, the pattern associated with the electric field traveling wave is further investigated by the spatio-temporal Koopman decomposition. The related dispersion diagram and an estimation of the overall propagation velocity are accurately recovered.    
Finally, the construction of a data-driven reduced order model of the physical system is illustrated. The outcome allows to fast simulate the dynamical response of the superlattice over a range of different configurations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75380' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1809)' class='star'><span class='star1809'>&star;</span></a> Benjamin Terschanski  <span id='bitlink-3588'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3588)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3588' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3588)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reactive Transport Models for Ice-Ocean Interfaces</b><br />Benjamin Terschanski<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-398.html'>Solving PDEs with DUNE-FEM</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small>Heat and mass exchange processes at the boundary between sea ice and ocean saltwater play a vital role in understanding the coupling between earth's ocean and atmosphere.   Ice-ocean interface models are furthermore used to constrain thickness and composition of the kilometer-thick shell of icy moons such as the Jovian moon Europa.     
Meso-scale models of the ice-saltwater interface treat the transition region between ice and seawater as a continuous mush containing a mix of solid and high-salinity brine [Buffo et al., Dynamics of a Solidifying Icy Satellite Shell, 2021]. This is in analogy to established enthalpy methods for the treatment of alloy solidification [Swaminathan and Voller, On the enthalpy method, 1993]. Governing equations for incompressible flow are coupled with thermal and solute transport through buoyancy and advective terms.     
In this contribution we focus on the numerical treatment of the mixture solidification problem.   Assuming thermodynamic equilibrium, conservation of energy and solute transport are solved with discontinuous Galerkin finite elements.   Our prototype uses the DUNE Python API [Dedner and Nolte, The Dune Python Module, 2018] and leverages several recent works on multiphase reactive transport.   In particular, we generalize a variable switching technique [Krabbenhoft et al., An implicit mixed enthalpy–temperature method for phase-change problems, 2007] to systems where the liquid fraction is a multivariable function.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75877' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1357)' class='star'><span class='star1357'>&star;</span></a> Irina K.

This allows the selection of a new policy at every time step, adapting online the planning strategy to balance the structural self-preservation and time to arrive at client location.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75443' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1416)' class='star'><span class='star1416'>&star;</span></a> Will Thacher  <span id='bitlink-3591'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3591)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3591' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3591)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A High-Order Cartesian Grid, Finite Volume Method for Elliptic Interface Problems</b><br />Will Thacher<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-312.html'>Recent Advances in Cut Cell Discretizations: Accuracy, Stability, and Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>In this work we solve the elliptic PDE $-\beta u + \nabla \cdot \left( \eta \mathbf{F}(u) \right) = f$ where $\beta, \eta$ and $f$ may be discontinuous across an interface.

Although vendor libraries provide basic kernels such as the BLAS suite, with modern workloads, it is becoming increasingly critical to accelerate their custom computations that have been codesign with the application algorithm in mind and are less likely to be supported by vendors out of the box due to their bespoke nature. In this talk, we motivate the need for custom GPU linear algebra kernels by taking our efforts to run all pairs shortest path on Summit and Frontier supercomputers as a case study, and highlight the features of our library, CUDA Algebra for Semirings (cuASR) that emerged from it. Highlighting this as a user story, we go over how it influences the design philosophy for open source vendor libraries that are expected to be extended by users, and we conclude with the new features in NVIDIA CUTLASS and how one can extend its abstractions to author custom kernels that achieve peak performance on modern CUDA hardware.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75193' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1462)' class='star'><span class='star1462'>&star;</span></a> Yann Thanwerdas  <span id='bitlink-3593'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3593)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3593' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3593)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Geometries of Covariance and Correlation Matrices</b><br />Yann Thanwerdas<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-321.html'>Geometry and Shape Analysis for Neuroscience: Geometric Structures in Neuroscience - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>Many data from neuroscience can me modeled by covariance matrices (EEG, MEG, MRI).

In this framework, the numerical solution using inner-outer iterative eigenvalue algorithms suffers from a collapsing spectral gap that leads to deteriorating converge rates. We solve the collapsing gap problem by a quasi-optimal spectral-shift strategy to uniformly bound the number of iterations with respect to different domain sizes. Since the algorithm requires the solutions of shifted linear systems, we further propose a two-level decomposition method that includes the already computed spectral asymptotics in a suitable coarse space. This domain decomposition preconditioner is easy to construct, leads to a bounded condition number for the shifted linear systems, and efficiently utilizes the geometric subdivision of the domain. We test the method's robustness and efficiency numerically. If time permits, we analyze the method's scalability within the theoretical framework of spectral coarse spaces.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75343' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(570)' class='star'><span class='star570'>&star;</span></a> Roger Thelwell  <span id='bitlink-3595'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3595)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3595' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3595)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Rewriting Almost Every Function As the Solution of Quadratic IVODEs</b><br />Roger Thelwell<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-125.html'>Exact Polynomialization and Quadratization of Nonlinear Dynamics - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we present an approach to recast non-polynomial IVODEs (e.g. elementary and piecewise differentiable) into polynomial differential systems that exploits auxiliary variables, and provide several examples.

Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes  (SPADs) are a particularly exciting  since they can be fabricated in an unmodified CMOS process. While SPADs have been used as true random number generators, they generally require additional digital circuitry and offer only a modest improvement over current approaches. In this talk, I will present a new approach exploiting the physics of SPADs to enable probabilistic neurons. We leverage the photon statistics to enable the stochastic behavior of the probabilistic bit. We make the event rate dependent on the computational energy by using the intrinsic filtering in the circuit and the event is converted into a state (p-bit) using a latch. I will then discuss how the event based nature can be further exploited to represent multi-valued states (or p-bytes). Results from a proof-of-principle SPAD based Ising and Potts annealers using discrete SPAD arrays show the realization of the concept in hardware along with the potential of using light intensity to control the global computational temperature. I will then conclude the talk by discussing some future avenues of exploration.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75638' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1805)' class='star'><span class='star1805'>&star;</span></a> Maxence Thevenet  <span id='bitlink-3597'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3597)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3597' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3597)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hipace++: Progress on the Quasi-Static Particle-in-Cell Method on GPU</b><br />Maxence Thevenet<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-397.html'>Performance Portable Implementations of Particle-in-Cell Methods</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G103<br /><br /><small>Simulations of plasma-based accelerators with the particle-in-cell (PIC) method are notoriously expensive, as they require a nanometer-scale resolution over a meter-scale propagation distance. Due to the Courant condition, this scale discrepancy results in a very large (many millions) number of time steps for a production simulation, which can be unworkable. The quasi-static PIC method is a reduced model not subject to the same Courant condition, thus accelerating these simulations by orders of magnitude.    
Developed in the last few years, HiPACE++ is the first quasi-static PIC code fully running on GPU. In this algorithm, a 3D problem is decomposed into many 2D problems (one per longitudinal cell). HiPACE++ exploits this property to reduce the volume of communications by orders of magnitude and harness the effectiveness of single-GPU FFTs and multi-grid solves. We will discuss the main algorithm tweaks needed to fully port the quasi-static PIC method on GPU (Nvidia or AMD) based on the AMReX library.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75875' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1700)' class='star'><span class='star1700'>&star;</span></a> Frederic Thevenon  <span id='bitlink-3598'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3598)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3598' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3598)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Overview of Eigensolver Algorithms Implemented in the Ansys Mechanical Software ( Mapdl)</b><br />Frederic Thevenon<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-376.html'>Advances and Challenges in Eigensolutions and Industrial Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75824' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(826)' class='star'><span class='star826'>&star;</span></a> Samuel Thibault  <span id='bitlink-3599'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3599)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3599' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3599)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Scaling Starpu's Task-Based Sequential Task Flow (STF) Inside Nodes and Between Nodes</b><br />Samuel Thibault<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-181.html'>Task-Based Runtimes for Emerging Heterogeneous System Architectures</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>To be able to get the best performance out of nowadays' complex architectures comprising GPUs, NICs, disks, etc., the HPC field is leaning more and more to task-based programming instead of e.g. thread-based programming approaches. This approach indeed allows to delegate most of the optimization work to a runtime system: computation scheduling, transferring data concurrently with task execution, data prefetching from disks to GPUs, network communications, etc.    
The StarPU runtime system has been proposing such a task-based programming paradigm, and promotes the use of the now-quite-common Sequential Task Flow (STF) programming style in which the main code of the application is a loop nest of task submissions which actually looks like a sequential source code. StarPU can then optimize the execution of the resulting task graph inside machines comprizing CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, disks... The StarPU-MPI layer extends this to to clusters by automatizing inter-node communications, allowing to keep the same application source code for both the debuggable sequential version and the scalable distributed heterogeneous version. The obtained performance outperforms the ScaLAPACK implementation, and is on par with the PARSEC performance. Using the example of the SUMMA algorithms variants, we show that we can have both a very simple, easy-to-maintain application code, and flexibility to adapt the algorithm to scale with different applicative situations.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75480' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(463)' class='star'><span class='star463'>&star;</span></a> Jonas Thies  <span id='bitlink-3600'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3600)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3600' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3600)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Performance of Low-Rank Tensor Algorithms</b><br />Jonas Thies<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-103.html'>Performance Engineering and Applications - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>We discuss low-rank tensor algorithms and in particular algorithms for the tensor-train (TT) format (known as MPS in computational physics).  We focus on the required building blocks and model their node-level performance on modern multi-core CPUs.  More specifically, we consider the lossy compression of large dense data (TT-SVD), as well as linear solvers in TT format (TT-MALS, TT-GMRES).  For the data compression, we derive the optimal roofline runtime for the complete algorithm based on the two main building blocks in an optimized implementation:  Q-less TSQR and tall-skinny matrix-matrix multiplication.  For the low-rank linear solvers, we categorize the different kinds of building blocks according to performance characteristics and show possible performance optimizations.  While all required tensor operations can be mapped onto standard BLAS/LAPACK routines theoretically, faster implementations need specific performance optimizations:  These include (1) avoiding costly singular-value decompositions (SVDs),  and (2) employing special fused operations for sequences of memory-bound tensor-contractions and reshaping operations,  as well as (3) tracking properties of tensors such as orthogonalities.

However, no direct observation of this effect from gravity has been made on a particle in freefall. A muonium beam diffracting through a series of gratings has proven to be a suitable method for recording such freefall. Simulating this with the best current understanding of diffraction and interferometry is vital in determining this antimatter-gravity relationship, since a physical construction requires a picometer-precise atom interferometer and muonium beam. The development of these simulations has both demonstrated the relative feasibility of experimentation and brought to question the viability in applying certain physical modeling and simulation methods.

The Krylov vectors  are close to orthogonal and linearly independent in finite precision.  The Arnoldi relative residual no longer stagnates above machine precision   and the smallest singular value of $V_k$ remains close to one.   The new Arnoldi-QR algorithm can also be employed to compute eigenvalues   with the Krylov-Schur algorithm and improves Krylov exponential integrators. An augmented-Arnoldi formulation is applied to Krylov subspace recycling.   A block-Krylov algorithm is employed with  an BMGS-LTS inter-ortho skeleton as in Carson et al (2022),   and a block triangular solve. When combined with an   oblique projection, similar to Embree et al (2017),    the recycling algorithm leads to significant reductions  in the number of solver iterations per linear system.    The weight is also interpreted in terms of the angle between residual   norms at restarts in LGMRES, Baker et al. (2006).  We demonstrate a 10-fold reduction in the iteration    count for warm bubble vertical convection governed by the    non-hydrostatic Euler equations and pressure projection for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations applied to wind-turbines.  In many cases, the recycle subspace eigen-spectrum may substitute  for a preconditioner.

Increases in air temperature is the primary direct driver of permafrost warming, but frequent coastal flooding has been recognized as another important driver indirectly contributing to permafrost warming. However, the impact of coastal flooding on permafrost has not been tested and remains poorly understood. Our goals are to 1) understand permafrost hydro-thermal dynamics under floods and 2) develop new capability to simulate arctic lake and permafrost thermal dynamics.    
We consider a coupled one-dimensional model of snow-lake-soil system with variable water body depth. The temperature distribution in the lake (with or without ice) is calculated by means of a heat diffusion equation in the scaled coordinate system to account for variability in the depth. The soil is a coupled model of heat equation for the temperature and Richards equation for the water content. Finally, we use the surface energy balance equation to model the snow layer.    
The numerical discretization and coupling of the physical processes are performed using the Amanzi-ATS software infrastructure. For model verification we compare the results of Amanzi-ATS simulations for three different lakes in Alaska with the seasonal observation data for the surface temperature and the depth of the snow and ice layers.

A traditional approach to solving such problems is implicit integration. More recently exponential integration ideas produced several classes of methods that can yield computational savings compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. In this talk we discuss how various approaches such as implicit, exponential and partitioned integration can be combined or used separately to design efficient schemes for stiff problems.  We will particularly present new implicit-exponential (IMEXP) partitioned methods and demonstrate their advantages using a suite of test problems.  These IMEXP schemes are built for problems where forcing term can be additively partitioned into two nonlinear components with stiffness carried by both, but only one possessing an efficient preconditioner. We introduce a new ansatz for constructing this type of methods and outline what advantages this new form can offer for stiff systems of this type.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75618' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(977)' class='star'><span class='star977'>&star;</span></a> Samuel Tomlinson  <span id='bitlink-3606'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3606)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3606' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3606)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Laminar Drag Reduction in Surfactant-Contaminated Superhydrophobic Channels</b><br />Samuel Tomlinson<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-213.html'>Recent Advances in Computations and Modeling of Thin Fluid Films - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>Although superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) show promise for drag reduction (DR) applications, their performance can be compromised by traces of surfactant that accumulate at liquid-gas interfaces, generating Marangoni stresses that increase drag. This question is addressed for a three-dimensional laminar flow in a plane periodic channel with SHSs along both walls, in the presence of soluble surfactant. We consider the regime in which bulk diffusion is sufficiently strong for concentration gradients normal to the SHSs to be small. Seeking solutions that are periodic in the streamwise and spanwise directions, and exploiting a long-wave theory that accounts for rapid transverse Marangoni-driven flow and shear-dispersion effects, we thereby reduce this high-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional model for the surfactant distribution. The system exhibits multiple regimes where asymptotic solutions can be constructed, which compare favourably with numerics. Some are characterised by advection and diffusion-dominated processes, where the liquid-gas interface exhibits shear-free behaviour and the DR is at its maximum. In contrast, others are dominated by Marangoni effects, where the liquid-gas interface exhibits no-slip behaviour and the DR vanishes. This analysis provides a guide for designing surfactant-contaminated SHSs to maximise the DR for applications.

The main problem is to determine the best damping matrix to be able to minimize the system average displacement amplitude. Damping optimization usually includes optimization of damping positions and corresponding damping viscosities.  Since the objective function is non-convex, a standard optimization approach typically requires a large number of objective function evaluations. We first propose a  dimension reduction approach that calculates approximation of the average displacement amplitude and additionally we efficiently use a low rank update structure that appears in the external damping matrix. Moreover, an error bound which allows determination of appropriate approximation orders is derived and  incorporated within the optimization method. We also present a theoretical error bound that allows determination of effective damping positions. The methodology proposed here provides a significant acceleration of the optimization process. The gain in efficiency is illustrated in numerical experiments.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75470' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(918)' class='star'><span class='star918'>&star;</span></a> Antoine Tonnoir  <span id='bitlink-3608'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3608)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3608' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3608)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Analysis of a Domain Decomposition Method for Convected Helmholtz Like Equation</b><br />Antoine Tonnoir<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-201.html'>Modern Solvers for the Helmholtz and Wave Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small>In this work, we are interested in solving a convected Helmholtz like equation.

Each model will have a deficiency in at least a small number of areas, such as the Madden--Julian Oscillation or the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Improving these aspects of atmosphere models often comes at the cost of introducing or worsening deficiencies in other areas. In contrast, it is possible to create specialized, low-dimensional models to capture these phenomena by simplifying many aspects of the full system. Here, we propose a strategy to allow different models communicate throughout a simulation. The communication lets us leverage the strengths of each model without needing to change their dynamics. The strategy is based on common data assimilation techniques used to combine models and real-world data. We implement this strategy in a test case consisting of a deficient tropical atmosphere model and a model of the Madden--Julian Oscillation. The models have different state spaces and different dynamics. We show that our strategy enriches the dynamics of both models beyond the information that is communicated between them.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75265' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1381)' class='star'><span class='star1381'>&star;</span></a> Anna-Karin Tornberg  <span id='bitlink-3610'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3610)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3610' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3610)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Function Extension Methodology for the Advection Diffusion Equation on Time Dependent Domains</b><br />Anna-Karin Tornberg<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-305.html'>Fast Algorithms for Variable Coefficient, Time-Dependent, and Inhomogeneous Problems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75684' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(480)' class='star'><span class='star480'>&star;</span></a> Aurora Torrente  <span id='bitlink-3611'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3611)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3611' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3611)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Band-Based Binary Indices for the Analysis of Gene Expression Data</b><br />Aurora Torrente<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-106.html'>Shape and Size in Medicine, Biotechnology and Materials Science - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>The statistical concept of depth induces an ordering from centre outwards in multivariate data. Most depth definitions are unfeasible for dimensions larger than three or four, but the Modified Band Depth (MBD) is a notable exception. It relates the centrality of each individual to its (partial) inclusion in all possible 'j-bands' formed by j distinct elements of the data set. We assess (dis)similarity between pairs of observations by accounting for such bands and constructing binary matrices associated to each pair. From these, contingency tables are calculated and used to derive standard similarity indices. Our approach is computationally efficient and can be applied to bands formed by any number of observations from the data set. We have evaluated the performance of several band-based similarity indices with respect to that of other classical distances in standard  tasks in a variety of high dimension, simulated and real gene expression data sets. Our experiments show the benefits of our technique, with some of the selected indices outperforming classical distances.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75380' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1901)' class='star'><span class='star1901'>&star;</span></a> Atte Torri  <span id='bitlink-3612'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3612)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3612' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3612)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Exploration of Optimal Tensor Contraction Strategies for Vector Inner Product in Tensor-Train Format</b><br />Atte Torri<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(42)' class='star'><span class='star42'>&star;</span></a> Manuel Torrilhon  <span id='bitlink-3613'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3613)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3613' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3613)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Maximum-Entropy Quadrature for Moment Equations in Kinetic Gas Theory</b><br />Manuel Torrilhon<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-10.html'>Computational Methods for Kinetic Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>Using the method of moments to approximate the solution of kinetic equations is a popular technique especially to model rarefied gases.

In this talk, we will review the maximum entropy approach and combine it with the quadrature method of moments. This allows to keep positive aspects from each approach while eliminating problematic features. Entropic quadrature calculates a sparse quadrature-based reconstruction of the unknown velocity distribution in a discrete way and the physical meaningful maximum-entropy principle is employed as a criterion for selecting a denser, possibly continuous quadrature among different quadratures fitting the given moments. We will discuss the construction of the closure and give several numerical examples of its performance in one and two dimensions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75197' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(957)' class='star'><span class='star957'>&star;</span></a> Andrea Tosin  <span id='bitlink-3614'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3614)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3614' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3614)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reconstruction of Traffic Speed Distributions from Kinetic Models with Uncertainties</b><br />Andrea Tosin<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-209.html'>Data-Driven Mathematical Models for Traffic Flow - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>In this talk, we discuss the ability of Boltzmann-type kinetic equations for traffic dynamics to predict speed distributions observable from rough traffic data. We adopt, in particular, the formalism of uncertainty quantification, since driver reactions are uncertain and related to different types of driver behaviour or different classes  of vehicles present in the traffic stream. Therefore, the calibration of the theoretical speed distribution has to face the reconstruction of the distribution of the uncertainty. We rely on experimental microscopic measurements of vehicle speeds (recorded on a German motorway) whose statistical distribution shows a multimodal trend. The calibration is performed by extrapolating the uncertain parameters of the kinetic distribution via a constrained optimisation procedure.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75520' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1845)' class='star'><span class='star1845'>&star;</span></a> Markus Towara  <span id='bitlink-3615'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3615)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3615' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3615)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Parallel Adjoint Taping Using MPI</b><br />Markus Towara<br />Tuesday, February 28 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-406.html'>Forward Alternatives to Back-Propagation in ML and Science</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Automatic Differentiation (AD) allows to efficiently and accurately calculate derivatives of expressions stated as computer code.  The adjoint data flow reversal of long evolutionary calculations (e.g. loops), where each iteration depends on a set of parameters and the output of the previous iterate, is a common occurrence in computational engineering (e.g. computational fluid dynamics simulation), physics (e.g. molecular dynamics) and computational finance (e.g. Monte Carlo paths).  For the extreme case of a scalar state, the execution as well as adjoint control flow reversal are inherently serial operations, as there is no spatial dimension to parallelize.  We propose a method, focusing on programs with such a structure, that exploits the run time difference typically exhibited by AD tools between pure function evaluation and evaluation with additional calculation of local derivative information (a process frequently called pre-accumulation), which is then later used by the data flow reversal.    
Additional parallelism is introduced into the computation by distributing the aforementioned calculation of local derivatives onto multiple processes.  A reference C++ implementation using MPI is presented, which allows us to reverse an OpenFOAM simulation.    
The proposed method is most beneficial for operator overloading AD tools, however the concepts are also applicable to source-to-source transformation and handwritten adjoints, or a hybrid of all approaches.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75887' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(148)' class='star'><span class='star148'>&star;</span></a> Adam K.

Approaches to modelling this behaviour normally come in two flavours: a macroscale, course-grained approach where the fluid is modelled as a continuum; and a microscale, detailed approach where the anisotropic structure within the background fluid is specifically modelled. The former approach has the benefit of speed, but in this talk I will share my experience of attempting the latter, in 3D, using high-performance computer simulations, and show how these simulations suggest the physical structure of the viscoelastic fluid directly affects the microorganism swimming through it.

However, the integral equations on which the standard BEM is based contain strongly-singular and hyper-singular kernels. Consequently, special theoretical and numerical treatment is required in implementing the method. In this talk, I will present a systematic procedure to develop a set of regularized boundary integral equations for modeling cracks in 2D linear multi-field media. The class of media treated is quite general and includes, in special cases, anisotropic elasticity, piezo-electricity, and magneto-electro-elasticity. The development of a pair of weakly-singular weak-form integral equations for ‘generalized displacement’ and ‘generalized traction’ is of particular interest. These equations are the basis of a weakly-singular Symmetric Galerkin BEM. The developed weak-form boundary integral equations are completely regularized in that all kernels that appear are (at most) weakly singular of order ln(r), where r is the distance between the source and field points. This feature allows standard Co elements to be utilized everywhere except at crack tips. I also present the development of a special crack-tip element that incorporates extra degrees of freedom at the tip node so that the ‘generalized stress intensity factors’ are obtained directly from the solution to the system of discretized equations. To verify the accuracy and versatility of the method, we examined various numerical examples in both infinite and finite domains. It is seen that highly accurate results for the relevant fracture data (i.e., the ‘generalized stress intensity factors’) can be obtained using relatively coarse meshes.

This makes them an ideal candidate for parallel-in-time (PIT) strategies.  Unfortunately, due to their extreme cost, these systems are simulated at the minimum threshold of spatial and temporal resolution, thus rendering the usual PIT strategy of spatiotemporal coarsening infeasible.  Here we present a parallel-in-time strategy that employs a coarsening of models, rather than meshes, to accelerate time to solution for high-dimensional kinetic plasma models by leveraging their much cheaper, lower dimensional fluid approximations.  These fluid models are closed via kinetic data computed in parallel, and are thus applicable far from the fluid limit.

Fully resolving these features within the balance laws thus involves expensive fine-scale computations which need to be conducted on macroscopic scales. The theory of homogenization provides an approach to derive effective macroscopic equations which eliminates the small scales by exploiting scale separation. An accurate homogenized model avoids the computationally-expensive task of numerically solving the underlying balance laws at a fine scale.    
In simple settings the homogenization produces an explicit formula for a macroscopic constitutive model, but in more complex settings it may only define the constitutive model implicitly. In these complex settings machine learning can be used to learn the constitutive model from localized fine-scale simulations. In the case of one-dimensional viscoelasticity, the linearity of the model allows for a complete analysis. For this case, we derive a homogenized constitutive model and develop a theory to prove that the model may be approximated by a recurrent   neural network (RNN) model that captures the memory; this may be thought of as discovering appropriate internal variables. Simulations are presented which validate the theory, and additional numerical experiments demonstrate extension of the methodology to higher dimensions and to nonlinear viscoplasticity.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75334' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1161)' class='star'><span class='star1161'>&star;</span></a> C&#233;dric Travelletti  <span id='bitlink-3620'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3620)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3620' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3620)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Universal Inversion: a Framework for Infusing Expert Knowledge in Bayesian Inverse Problems</b><br />C&#233;dric Travelletti<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-255.html'>Blending Learning and Dynamical Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>In the natural sciences, one is often faced with the problem of reconstructing some unknown function from indirect data. Such problems are broadly known as inverse problem. Solving these generally requires some form of regularization and Bayesian techniques such as Gaussian process (GP) priors have proved useful to that end. Nevertheless, in most fields of applications, there exists prior knowledge about the unknown phenomenon that cannot be directly included in the specification of the GP prior and would be better modelled by a set of trend functions. In this presentation, we will show how the traditional, GP-based Bayesian inversion framework can be extended to include (partially) known trends. These trends are modelled as linear combinations of basis functions with a multivariate Gaussian prior on the trend coefficients. In essence, this is an extension of the usual universal kriging approach to inverse problems,  which we thus deem "universal inversion". We will demonstrate our universal inversion techniques on a large-scale gravimetric inverse problem based on data collected on Stromboli island, demonstrating how field knowledge can help improve the inversion. The introduction of trends in the inversion process fosters new questions pertaininig to model selection. To tackle these, we extend recent results about fast k-fold cross-validation to the inverse problem and present an overview of the new venues of inquiry in model selection opened by fast cross-validation.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75581' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(924)' class='star'><span class='star924'>&star;</span></a> Eran Treister  <span id='bitlink-3621'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3621)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3621' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3621)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multigrid-Augmented Deep Learning Preconditioners for the Helmholtz Equation</b><br />Eran Treister<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-202.html'>Modern Solvers for the Helmholtz and Wave Equations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G111<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75512' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(307)' class='star'><span class='star307'>&star;</span></a> Thomas Trigo Trindade  <span id='bitlink-3622'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3622)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3622' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3622)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Time-Marching Schemes for Dynamical Low Rank Approximations</b><br />Thomas Trigo Trindade<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-67.html'>Nonlinear Approximations of Latent Dynamics for Model Reduction and Beyond - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>The Dynamical Low Rank (DLR) method is a time-dependent reduced basis approach attractive for the quantification of uncertainties of time-dependent random PDEs for which the optimal low-rank subspace may vary significantly over time. The true solution is approximated by an expansion of deterministic modes weighted by stochastic coefficients, all time-dependent, mimicking a truncated Karhunen-Loewen expansion; evolution equations are available for the deterministic and stochastic modes. Time-integration of the DLR equations may be challenging as the DLR structure may lead to additional stiffness in the system. Recently, we have shown that a projector-splitting scheme, combined with standard first-order time integration of the operator, leads to a fully discrete DLR solution of a random parabolic PDE that verifies the same norm bound properties as a standard (non-DLR) discrete parabolic system, and is not affected by the additional stiffness in the equations. In this talk, we propose extensions of the projector-splitting scheme, including a practical Strang scheme as well as other time-marching schemes which improve on the accuracy of the approximation and its numerical stability compared to the explicit integrators while not being overly expensive.

Confluent motion of epithelial cells can be described using simpler active vertex models, in which cells are polygons forming a Voronoi tessellation of the tissue. The dual Delaunay triangulation comprises cells centers that evolve according to dynamics including collective inertia and active forces. To model motion on supracellular length scales, we should develop continuum theories informed by models describing cell motion. Here we describe coarse graining strategies of the active vertex model that produce continuum equations for density, mean velocity, pressure and nematic order parameter and include active forces. We extract coarsened quantities directly from simulations of the active vertex model and compare with results from the continuum examples equations in simple cases of wound healing assays and formation of fingers.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75379' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1410)' class='star'><span class='star1410'>&star;</span></a> Riccardo Trinchero  <span id='bitlink-3624'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3624)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3624' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3624)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Kernel-Based Regressions for Vector-Valued Problems in Microwave Applications</b><br />Riccardo Trinchero<br />Thursday, March 2 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-310.html'>AI-Driven Design and Optimization of Future Electronics - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>This talk presents a modeling framework for vector-valued functions based on the multi-output kernel Ridge regression (KRR). The proposed formulation of the KRR relies on a generalized definition of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to the case of vector-valued functions, thus bridging the gap between multi-output Artificial Neural Network (NN) structures and standard scalar kernel-based approaches. The above multi-output formulation of the KRR can be suitably adopted to train a vector-output surrogate model able to predict the frequency responses of parametric microwave structures affected by several parameters with large variability. Its performance, in terms of parametric and stochastic analysis, is compared with the ones provided by two state-of-the-art techniques, such as the combination of the principal components analysis (PCA) and the least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) regression and a multi-output feed-forward NN structure.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75698' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(34)' class='star'><span class='star34'>&star;</span></a> Alok Tripathy  <span id='bitlink-3625'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3625)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3625' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3625)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reducing Communication in Graph Neural Network Training</b><br />Alok Tripathy<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-8.html'>Scaling Data Science, AI, and, ML on Massively Multi-Threaded Systems - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful and flexible neural networks that use the naturally sparse connectivity information of the data. GNNs represent this connectivity as sparse matrices, which have lower arithmetic intensity and thus higher communication costs compared to dense matrices, making GNNs harder to scale to high concurrencies than convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. We show that communication-avoiding matrix multiplication algorithms can accelerate GNN training compared to existing training methods with two families of algorithms. The first asymptotically reduces communication in full-batch training by leveraging 1D, 1.5D, 2D, and 3D SpMM algorithms. The second applies communication-avoiding algorithms for SpGEMM to parallelize GNN minibatch sampling algorithms (e.g. GraphSAGE, LADIES, GraphSAINT). Altogether, these algorithms optimize communication across the full GNN training pipeline. We experiment on graph datasets with billions of edges on over a hundred GPUs to show the performance benefits of these algorithms.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75194' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1316)' class='star'><span class='star1316'>&star;</span></a> Christian Trott  <span id='bitlink-3626'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3626)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3626' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3626)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Future of Linear Algebra in the C++ Standard</b><br />Christian Trott<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-290.html'>Recent Advances in Numerical Linear Algebra Programming and Libraries - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Linear Algebra support is coming to the ISO C++ standard, delivering a future where developers of scientific code do not need to explicitly deal with specific vendor APIs or Fortran/C++ interoperability just to call a matrix-vector multiply.

We demonstrate the usefulness of the results by applying them in the context of high-dimensional drift estimation and Langevin MCMC for moderately heavy-tailed target densities.

However, current methods used in this field are primarily based on shooting methods, in which the dynamics of the system driven by the pulse are simulated forward in time, gradients with respect to pulse parameters are computed, a gradient-based update is applied to the pulse, and the process is repeated until convergence. However, shooting methods suffer from many shortcomings, including poor numerical conditioning and difficulty dealing with many types of constraints. In contrast, we propose the use of collocation methods for these quantum optimization problems, in which both state and control variables are both simultaneously optimized subject to discretized dynamics constraints. Collocation methods offer the ability to handle general nonlinear constraints on states and controls, the ability to leverage dynamically infeasible “warm starting” for faster convergence, and dramatically improved numerical properties over shooting methods. We demonstrate the capabilities of our quantum collocation method, PICO, on several examples, including a minimum-time gate transition for a multi-level transmon system.

Following the detailed transport of radiation in 3D hydrodynamical simulations can reveal multi-dimensional effects that would otherwise be lost in models assuming simple geometries. As massive stars approach the end of their lives and explode as core-collapse supernovae, radiation transport through the stellar ejecta also leaves informative imprints of the progenitor stars' properties on the observed light curves and spectra. Reliably capturing the relevant radiative processes is instrumental to proper inference of the progenitors' stellar properties. In this talk, I will discuss the application of Monte Carlo methods in numerical radiation transport, including acceleration schemes optimized to deliver efficient calculations in high-density media that shape the life and death of massive stars.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75679' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1047)' class='star'><span class='star1047'>&star;</span></a> Karel Tuma  <span id='bitlink-3631'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3631)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3631' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3631)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Thermodynamically Compatible Non-Isothermal Phenomenological Model for Mullins Effect: Implementation and Simulations of Selected Problems</b><br />Karel Tuma<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-229.html'>Modeling and Computation for Implicitly Constituted Materials: Fluids, Solids, Plasmas, and Mixtures - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>This talk builds on the talk by V. Pruša: "A Thermodynamic Framework for Non-Isothermal Phenomenological Models of Mullins Effect". We derive a thermodynamically compatible model for the Mullins effect including a consistent evolution equation for the temperature. The system of balance equations together with an implicit constitutive relation for the Cauchy stress tensor is formulated in the Eulerian setting. For convenience, the equations are transformed to the Lagrangian setting and used for simulations of several different problems such as the investigation of the interplay between the Mullins effect and the Gough–Joule effect or the study of the Mullins effect for a cylinder subjected to combined extension and torsion.    
The model is implemented with Firedrake finite element code that provides automatic differentiation and is tightly connected with PETSc solver library, which enables us to use effective iterative solvers.

However, the increased focus of security on academic HPC systems is leading to multifactor authentication (MFA) processes, usually employing a time-based one-time password (TOPT), becoming commonplace. This causes a large problem for both researchers who wish to use workflow tools which need unattended access to HPC facilities, and for HPC service providers who want to enable research but improve system security. In this presentation I will briefly set the context for this issue before presenting some approaches that have been taken to enable such functionality on HPC services with MFA. I will conclude with showing why solving the problem sustainably requires both workflow software and HPC services to be designed with input from all parties; and why RSEs are the key personnel to enabling long-term, sustainable solutions to enable complex research workflows in a secure manner and improve researcher and HPC service productivity.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75706' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(417)' class='star'><span class='star417'>&star;</span></a> Tomasz Tyranowski  <span id='bitlink-3635'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3635)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3635' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3635)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data-Driven Structure-Preserving Model Reduction for Stochastic Hamiltonian Systems</b><br />Tomasz Tyranowski<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-92.html'>Structure-Preserving Model Reduction for Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Systems - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>In this work we demonstrate that SVD-based model reduction techniques known for ordinary differential equations, such as the proper orthogonal decomposition, can be extended to stochastic differential equations in order to reduce the computational cost arising from both the high dimension of the considered stochastic system and the large number of independent Monte Carlo runs.

There is growing interest to use deep learning techniques to more efficiently and effectively model the vascular system and to use computational methods to provide insight to the flow of blood in the organ. Using PocketNet paradigm, we create a 3D neural network for vessel segmentation on CT images. From these segmentations, the blood vessels are skeletonized and their centerlines are computational domains for reduced 1D models while the liver is converted to a 3D mesh to be the simulation domain. Using the 3D liver and the 1D vasculature we model the flow of solute from the vessels into the liver using finite element method. Such automation of vessel segmentation and simulation of flow modeling can be translated into the clinical setting to improve patient outcome and care. This is particularly beneficial for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma where the delivery of chemotherapy to hepatic tumors can be modeled.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75238' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(96)' class='star'><span class='star96'>&star;</span></a> Dariusz Uci&#324;ski  <span id='bitlink-3637'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3637)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3637' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3637)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Maximin-Efficient Experimental Design for Orthogonally Invariant Information Criteria</b><br />Dariusz Uci&#324;ski<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-21.html'>Optimal Experimental Design and Robust Optimization for Large-Scale Inverse Problems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>Optimal selection of measurement locations for parameter estimation is usually focused on maximizing an optimality criterion defined on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) associated with the estimated parameters. But different optimality criteria may yield different optimal designs. In consequence, strong interest is generated by compromise solutions which would produce decent values for a broadest possible class of design criteria. In the search for such universally suboptimal solutions, an approach is proposed to compute designs maximizing the minimal efficiency with respect to the class of orthogonally invariant information criteria. This class is broad enough to include all optimum design criteria encountered in practice. It turns out that the minimal efficiency with respect to this class equals that with respect to a finite set of criteria which generalize the well-known E-optimum design criterion. An extremely simple and fast algorithm is proposed to numerically construct such designs, which is based on the appropriate semi-infinite programming problem formulation. Its idea is to alternate between solving the eigenproblem for the current FIM and finding a solution to a linear-programming problem. In this way the nondifferentiability of the optimality criterion is circumvented and the algorithm is guaranteed to converge in a finite number of steps.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75225' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(681)' class='star'><span class='star681'>&star;</span></a> Hannes Uecker  <span id='bitlink-3638'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3638)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3638' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3638)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Recent Developments in Numerical Continuation and Bifurcation for Nonlinear PDEs</b><br />Hannes Uecker<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-150.html'>Algorithms for Bifurcation Analysis of Partial Differential Equations</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>Numerical continuation and bifurcation methods   have become important tools to study PDEs in 2D and higher   space dimension, with some general purpose toolboxes available,   for instance {\tt BifurcationKit.jl} [Veltz, https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02902346, 2020], {\tt coco}--interfaces for PDEs [Dankowicz and Schilder,    Recipes for continuation, SIAM 2013],   and {\tt pde2path} [Uecker, Numerical continuation and bifurcation for   nonlinear PDEs, SIAM 2021].

The technique is based on a greedy type selection of frame elements to positively influence the spectrum of rank one updates of a matrix. It is a modification of the 2009 algorithm by Batson, Spielman, Srivastava and produces an optimal size subsystem without additional weights. It moreover achieves this in polynomial time and avoids the Weaver subsampling (based on the Kadison-Singer theorem) which has been applied in  earlier work, yielding rather bad oversampling constants. In the second part of the talk we give applications for multivariate function recovery. Here we consider the particular problem of $L_2$ and $L_\infty$ recovery from sample values. In this context, the presented subsampling technique allows to determine optimal (in cardinality) node sets even suitable for plain least squares recovery. It can be applied, for instance, to reconstruct functions in dominating mixed-smoothness Sobolev spaces, where we are able to discretize trigonometric polynomials with frequencies from a hyperbolic cross with nodes coming from an implementable subsampling procedure. Inaddition we may apply this to subspaces coming from hyperbolic cross wavelet subspaces. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical findings.

In particular, we consider i) classes of convex optimization problems of finite sum form with (possibly strongly) convex and (possibly) smooth functional components, and ii) first-order methods that can be written in so-called state-space form, i.e., as a linear system in feedback interconnection with the subdifferentials of the functional components of the objective function. The validity of a given target linear convergence rate is established by deriving a necessary and sufficient condition for verifying the existence of a quadratic Lyapunov function for the algorithm and problem class under consideration for the chosen rate, which amounts to the feasibility of a small-sized semidefinite program. This allows us to find the smallest linear convergence rate for which such a quadratic Lyapunov function exists, by bisection search, yielding a tight procedure. The approach is numerically exemplified on several algorithmic schemes.

Within the Bayesian approach to these problems, edge-preservation is often achieved using Markov random field priors based on heavy-tailed distributions. Another strategy, popular in sparse statistics, is the application of hierarchical shrinkage priors. An advantage of this formulation lies in expressing the prior as a conditionally Gaussian distribution depending on heavy-tailed distributed hyperparameters. In this presentation, we revisit the shrinkage horseshoe prior and introduce its formulation for edge-preserving settings. Moreover, we discuss a Gibbs sampling framework to solve the Bayesian inverse problem. Image deblurring and computed tomography applications show that our computational procedure is able to compute sharp edge-preserving posterior point estimates with reduced uncertainty.

Within each cycle, the approximation is computed using smoothing on fine levels and solving on the coarsest level.    
With growth of the size of the problems that are being solved, the size of the problems on the coarsest grid is also growing and their solution can become a computational bottleneck. In practice the problems on the coarsest-grid are often solved approximately, for example by Krylov subspace methods or direct methods based on low rank approximation; see, e.g., [M. Huber, Massively parallel and fault-tolerant multigrid solvers on peta-scale systems, Ph.D. Thesis, Technical University of Munich, Germany, 2019], [Buttari et al., Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications (2021)]. The accuracy of the coarsest-grid solver is typically determined experimentally in order to balance the cost of the solves and the total number of multigrid cycles required for convergence.    
In this talk, we present an approach to analyzing the effect of approximate coarsest-grid solves in the multigrid V-cycle method for symmetric positive definite problems. We discuss several stopping criteria derived based on the analysis and suggest a strategy for utilizing them in practice. The results are illustrated through numerical experiments.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75385' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1402)' class='star'><span class='star1402'>&star;</span></a> Noa Vaknin  <span id='bitlink-3648'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3648)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3648' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3648)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Pebbling Game and Alternative Basis for High Performance Matrix Multiplication</b><br />Noa Vaknin<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-308.html'>Recent Advances in Combinatorial Scientific Computing - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>Matrix multiplication is one of the most extensively used kernels in scientific computing. Although sub-cubic algorithms exist, most high performance implementations are based on the classical $\Theta\left(n^{3}\right)$ matrix multiplication. Designing an algorithm that obtains even modest improvements in performance over existing implementations, requires carefully addressing challenges such as reducing computation costs, communication costs, and memory footprint.    
We provide the first high performance general matrix-matrix multiplication that utilizes the alternative basis method on Strassen's algorithm. We reduce the basis transformations overheads and decrease the memory footprint of the bilinear phase by using the pebbling game optimization scheme, consequentially improving both arithmetic and communication costs. Our algorithm outperforms DGEMM on feasible matrix dimensions starting at $n=1024$. It obtains an increasing speedup up to nearly $\times2$ speedup for larger matrix dimensions.

Basically, it is a virtual image of a real asset, integrating all data, models and other digital information over the lifecycle. Its true power lies in the relationship with its physical counterpart. Data acquired on the physical asset can validate and enrich the digital twin. Inversely, the digital representation can bring value to the physical asset. Dedicated digital twin encapsulations can be extracted to model a specific set of behaviors in a specific context, delivering a stand-alone executable representation referred to as the Executable Digital Twin. The process and basic methodologies of the Executable Digital Twin are reviewed. Key enabling technologies are fast simulation methods, Model Order Reduction and state estimation. Data reduction approaches include the use of machine learning to allow compact representations of complex non-linear systems. Hybrid co-simulation linking the executable models in an open runtime environment are key.   The concept is illustrated by several examples in the automotive, aerospace and manufacturing industries.

This department applies mathematics in a very broad sense, from computational physics, through signal processing up to artificial intelligence. The Mathware department spun out of the mathematics department of the Technical University of Eindhoven a little over 10 years ago. Over these 10 years (and more), many lessons have been learned on how to approach industrial mathematics coming from a background of applied and numerical mathematics in an academic setting, as well as experiencing the growth from 10 people to 60 people. These experiences have led to principled approaches applied by Sioux regarding people management, technology management, software quality management and foremost project management through 'the Mathware method'.

In this talk, I will introduce and analyse a framework [1] for the neural optimization of discrete weak formulations, suitable for finite element methods. The main idea of the framework is to include a neural-network function acting as a control variable in the weak form. Finding the neural control that (quasi-) minimizes a suitable cost (or loss) functional, then yields a numerical approximation with desirable attributes. In particular, the framework allows in a natural way the incorporation of known data of the exact solution, or the incorporation of stabilization mechanisms (e.g., to remove spurious oscillations).     
The main result of the analysis pertains to the well-posedness and convergence of the associated constrained-optimization problem. In particular, under certain conditions, discrete weak forms are stable, and quasi-minimizing neural controls exist, which converge quasi-optimally. The analysis results are specialized to Galerkin, least- squares and minimal-residual formulations, where the neural-network dependence appears in the form of suitable weights. Elementary numerical experiments support our findings and demonstrate the potential of the framework.

In recent years, the scientific computing community has started to gravitate towards machine learning techniques to attempt to solve this issue. However, stability and abidance by physical structure laws of the resulting closure models is still an open problem.    
We apply a spatial averaging filter to a high-resolution reference simulation to reduce the degrees of freedom of the system and derive a new kinetic energy conservation condition. We then suggest a data-driven compression to represent the subgrid-scale content as latent variables, living on the coarse grid, in order to comply with our new conservation condition. Finally, a skew-symmetric energy-conserving convolutional neural network architecture is introduced that can be enhanced with dissipative terms to account for viscous flows. Combined with a structure-preserving discretization this framework is used to evolve both the filtered solution and the latent subgrid-scale representation in time in a structure-preserving fashion. This yields stability while still allowing for backscatter.    
We apply the methodology to both the viscous Burgers' equation and Korteweg-De Vries equation in 1-D and show increased accuracy and stability as compared to a standard convolutional neural network.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75430' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1561)' class='star'><span class='star1561'>&star;</span></a> Erik van Haren  <span id='bitlink-3657'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3657)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3657' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3657)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Math Joy in the Smartpool Curriculum</b><br />Erik van Haren<br />Thursday, March 2 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-344.html'>Raising Mathematical Awareness via the SmartPool Project</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>In pursuing a synergy between mathematics and pool billiard a Smartpool curriculum was solicited at the start of 2019 based on the author’s experience as a math teacher and former pool player.

They are based on iterative minimization of the KL-divergence (or other distance measures) between the pdf represented by the particles and the posterior pdf. The methodology can be seen as an ensemble of 3Dvars for a filter, and an ensemble of 4Dvars for a smoother, in which the particles interact during the minimization. Unfortunately, deterministic particle flows are biased for finite ensemble sizes. Recently it has been realized that this bias disappears for any ensemble size when a stochastic version of the particle flow is used. The idea is to consider the flow as a Langevin dynamics over the configuration space spanned by the particles. This leads to an extra stochastic term in the minimization equations, which turns out to be relatively simple to implement. A further problem is that particle flow filters need the gradient of the log of the prior pdf, which is only know by its samples. Hence calculating its log gradient is problematic. We developed a practical solution to this problem of estimating the gradient of the log of the prior in high-dimensional sequential applications, using kernel methods and localization procedures.    
In this talk I will briefly explain the theory and present results of particle flow filters and smoothers for high-dimensional geophysical systems, comparing stochastic and deterministic versions.       </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75692' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(173)' class='star'><span class='star173'>&star;</span></a> Tristan Van Leeuwen  <span id='bitlink-3661'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3661)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3661' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3661)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimisation Challenges in Computational Imaging</b><br />Tristan Van Leeuwen<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-38.html'>Recent Advances in Stochastic Optimization and Computational Game Theory - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75254' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(19)' class='star'><span class='star19'>&star;</span></a> Marcus Van Lier-Walqui  <span id='bitlink-3662'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3662)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3662' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3662)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Bayesian Tuning of Earth System Models in Global and Single-Column Simulations, Constrained by Satellite Observations and High Resolution Models</b><br />Marcus Van Lier-Walqui<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-4.html'>Understanding Cloud Physics Using Stochastic, Dynamical, and Data-Driven Modeling - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G108<br /><br /><small>Earth System Models solve the equations of motion for geophysical fluid flow on the globe numerically at discrete points on a 3D grid that spans the Earth. Numerous processes occur on sub-grid scales and cannot be explicitly resolved by grid-scale variables. And yet, these processes strongly affect grid-scale fluid motion as well as thermodynamical and radiative properties. Examples of these sub-grid processes include the “microphysics” of how cloud and precipitation particles grow and interact. There is necessary approximation in the modeling of sub-grid scale effects on the grid-scale variables; additionally many of the sub-grid processes are uncertain at any scale. These approximations and uncertainties result in forecast errors. Recently, efforts have been proposed to systematically optimize parameters of models of sub-grid processes using observations. One such approach has been used with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE climate model, informed by satellite observational data. The approach is Bayesian and employs a MCMC sampler in conjunction with machine learning emulators to estimate the probability density over 45 parameters for various sub-grid processes. We present this methodology, which uses a relatively small number (~500) of one-year global climate simulations, and also discuss the potential benefit of incorporating computationally inexpensive “single-column model” simulations that focus on specific regimes of climate system behavior.

Developers tend to use different libraries that provide these operations for them. One such library is Proto. It is a C++ based domain specific library designed to provide an intuitive interface that optimizes the designing and scheduling of an algorithm aimed at solving various partial differential equations numerically. The high level of abstractions used in Proto can be fused together to improve its current performance. However, abstraction fusion cannot be performed easily by a compiler.  In order to overcome this shortcoming we present ProtoX, a code generation framework for stencil operation based on Proto and uses SPIRAL as its backend. SPIRAL is a GAP based code generation system that focuses on generating highly optimized target code in C/C++. We demonstrate the construction of ProtoX by considering two examples, the 2D Poisson problem and the Euler equations that appear in the study of gas dynamics. Some of the code generated for these two problem specifications is shown along with the initial speedup result.

At the same time, robust control theory teaches us that near-perfect modelling is not required in all situations. Often, control policies can be obtained from data as long as the uncertainty is "not too large". Therefore, taking into account the eventual purpose of the data is of paramount importance when learning dynamics.     
In this talk, I will introduce the concept of data informativity for control. This concept captures the richness of data that is required for various data-based control problems. We will then discuss necessary and sufficient conditions under which a given dataset is informative for stabilization and for optimal control. These conditions also lead to new methods to design (optimal) controllers directly from given data via semidefinite programming.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75415' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1429)' class='star'><span class='star1429'>&star;</span></a> Ben van Werkhoven  <span id='bitlink-3668'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3668)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3668' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3668)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Automatically Exploring GPU Program Design Spaces for Increased Productivity and Sustainability</b><br />Ben van Werkhoven<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-315.html'>Towards Improvement of Sustainability and Productivity for Research Software - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have revolutionized the computing landscape in the past decade and are seen as one of enabling factors in recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence. However, it is very difficult to unlock to full computational power of the GPU. This is because there are many degrees of freedom in GPU programming, and typically only a handful of specific combinations of optimizations and parameter choices result in near-optimal performance. To obtain such highly-efficient kernels it is required to search vast and discontinuous program design spaces, which is infeasible for programmers to do by hand. Moreover, this search process would have to be repeated for different hardware and for different input problems, leading to productivity and sustainability issues with GPU applications. This talk gives a brief introduction to Kernel Tuner, a tool that allows programmers to create tunable applications that can be automatically optimized for any combination of hardware and input problems. Using run-time kernel selection and compilation based on auto-tuning results, programmers can create sustainable a pplications that can achieve near optimal performance on a wide variety of hardware and inputs.

Within many of these molecular systems, there is a natural time-scale separation present between the fast (microscopic) dynamics, and the slowly changing global conformation of the molecule determined by a few (macroscopic) variables.    
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a general sampling algorithm that has been designed for sampling from probability distributions determined by a potential energy function. The objective is to construct a stochastic process whose time-invariant distribution is the invariant distribution of the molecular system By ergodicity, we can record samples from a single path of the process, and then these samples are consistent with invariant distribution. However, when the underlying system has a medium to large time-scale separation, the MCMC method may remain stuck in one of the local minima of the potential energy function, prohibiting a swift exploration of the complete state space of the molecular system.    
In my talk, I will present a new micro-macro MCMC method (mM-MCMC) in which we first sample from the macroscopic variables, before reconstructing a new molecular instance that is consistent with the macroscopic value. I will give a detailed explanation of the algorithm, and show its efficiency on two molecular examples if time permits.  	    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75501' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(187)' class='star'><span class='star187'>&star;</span></a> Tommaso Vanzan  <span id='bitlink-3670'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3670)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3670' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3670)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Multigrid Method for Challenging Optimal Control Problems Constrained by Random PDEs</b><br />Tommaso Vanzan<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-41.html'>Advances in Optimal Control and Shape Optimization Concerning Applications in Physics and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>In this contribution we present a multigrid method to solve the full-space optimality systems that arise in Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) constrained by random Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).  These optimality systems are of very large dimension, and are often characterized by $N$ state PDEs, $N$ adjoint PDEs, and a single optimality condition, where $N$ is the total number of collocation points used to discretize the probability space.  Our approach is based on a collective smoother that requires the solution (possibly in parallel) of several reduced linear systems, each of dimension $2(N+1)\times 2(N+1)$, which can be achieved with optimal linear complexity.  The efficiency of the multigrid scheme is tested on several problems, including a simple unconstrained linear-quadratic OCP, an OCP with box constraints and a $L^1$ penalization on the control, and a risk-adverse OCP involving the smoothed CVaR risk measure.  In addition, the multigrid solver presented is robust against several important parameters of the model problems considered.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75257' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1272)' class='star'><span class='star1272'>&star;</span></a> David Vargas  <span id='bitlink-3671'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3671)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3671' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3671)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Multigrid Reduction in Time for Chaotic Problems</b><br />David Vargas<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-279.html'>Advances in Time-Parallel Methods for Challenging Problems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) extends the well known two-level Parareal algorithm to a full multigrid method, and has demonstrated optimal scaling for parabolic problems. However, chaotic problems have proved more difficult, since chaotic initial value problems are inherently ill-conditioned. MGRIT relies on a hierarchy of successively coarser time-grids to iteratively correct the solution on the finest time-grid, but due to the nature of chaotic systems, subtle inaccuracies on the coarser levels can lead to poor coarse-grid corrections. We propose a modification to nonlinear FAS multigrid, as well as a novel time-coarsening scheme, which together better capture long term behavior on coarse grids and greatly improve convergence of MGRIT for chaotic initial value problems. We present our implementation of the algorithm in the XBraid software package, and provide supporting numerical results for the Lorenz system and demonstrate parallel speedup for the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75635' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(984)' class='star'><span class='star984'>&star;</span></a> Geoff Vasil  <span id='bitlink-3672'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3672)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3672' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3672)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Generalising the Classical Tau Method for Fun and Profit</b><br />Geoff Vasil<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-215.html'>Applications & Implementations of Fast Spectral Methods - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>The classical tau method for differential equations refers to solving an approximate system exactly over polynomials, instead of finding approximate solutions to exact ODEs & PDEs. While very similar, this distinction has practical consequences for the analysis and acquisition of solutions. Classical methods set the residual as the span of the highest numerical basis elements. However, once an appropriate residual space is proscribed, a finite polynomial solution exists independent of any algorithm to obtain it. Chebyshev polynomials are excellent numerically, but even lowly monomials (however poorly conditioned in a computer) are fantastic for analysing solutions on paper. This talk will present some data on using a wider range of tau polynomials. We will show the dependence of eigenvalues on the choice of residual space, including the appearance of spurious spectrum and the accuracy of resolved modes. Finally, we will discuss systematic efforts to optimise performance by considering tau-corrections as oscillatory low-rank updates to differential operators.

With the availability of meta-data and parameter-driven simulations, the demand for automated workflows to reproduce computational experiments across platforms has grown.     
In general, a computational workflow is defined as a step-by-step description for accomplishing a scientific objective, expressed in terms of tasks and their data dependencies. Characterized through their input-output relation, workflows are designed such that the associated meta-data can be used interchangeably and redundantly.     
As a part of the MaRDI consortium [www.mardi4nfdi.com] on research data management in numerical mathematics, we develop a novel computational framework that focuses on automation of abstracting meta-data embedded in an ontology of mathematical objects while negating the underlying execution and environment dependencies into multi-layered descriptions. Herein, we consider various computational experiments as case studies, and systematically incorporate them into our workflow tool and data provenance framework. Furthermore, we show how best to apply the FAIR principles to computational workflows, such that abstracted components are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable in nature. Going forward, we also plan to provide the developed FAIR CSE workflow in electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) with user-friendly guidelines.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75530' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(908)' class='star'><span class='star908'>&star;</span></a> Rik Verbiest  <span id='bitlink-3674'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3674)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3674' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3674)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Two-Dimensional Hyperbolic Shallow Water Moment Equations</b><br />Rik Verbiest<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-199.html'>Shallow Water Flows: Modeling and Numerical Methods - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>The recently derived Shallow Water Moment Equations (SWME) are an extension of the Shallow Water Equations and allow for vertical changes in the horizontal velocity. This results in a system that is more accurate in situations where the horizontal velocity varies considerably over the height of the fluid. Unfortunately, these models lack global hyperbolicity. This has previously been observed for the 1D SWME and we show that the loss of hyperbolicity also occurs in the 2D systems. We derive 2D Hyperbolic Shallow Water Moment Equations (HSWME) by modifying the system matrix.     
After the derivation of the 2D equations, an equilibrium stability analysis of the new system is performed. Equilibrium manifolds are derived and structural stability conditions are checked for these manifolds. The analysis is a direct extension of the work done on the one-dimensional equations. We show that the 2D HSWME contain stable and unstable equilibrium states.     
Next, a formulation of the SWME in cylindrical coordinates is presented. The model is useful in situations where cylindrical coordinates are more appropriate, e.g., when the application exhibits circular symmetry, as is the case in the modelling of a tsunami, for example. Finally, a hyperbolic system for axisymmetric flow is derived.

Some bugs can be tracked with conventional tools in a single MPI rank, but genuine parallel errors often need to be debugged in parallel. Fixing an application that requires at least 100 ranks to crash can be very challenging, even with state-of-the-art parallel debuggers. We developed a novel data-oriented parallel programming model that allows one to express parallel algorithms in a generic way, without explicitly relaying on MPI communication directives. This makes possible to use different back-ends to run the generic parallel algorithms. With a sequential back-end, the data structures are logically parallel from the user perspective, but they are processed using a single rank. This makes possible to use serial debuggers for code development, which dramatically improves the user experience. Once the code has been debugged with the sequential back-end, it can be deployed in a supercomputer using a MPI back-end. Using the new model, we have implemented distributed vectors, sparse matrices, and other functionality needed in distributed-memory FE computations. They are implemented in Julia and made freely available in github [github.com/fverdugo/PartitionedArrays.jl]. With these tools, we were able to solve large FE computations with nearly optimal weak and strong scaling up to tends of thousands of CPU cores [doi.org/10.21105/joss.04157].    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75281' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(99)' class='star'><span class='star99'>&star;</span></a> Deepanshu Verma  <span id='bitlink-3676'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3676)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3676' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3676)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Advances and Challenges in Solving High-Dimensional HJB Equations Arising in Optimal Control</b><br />Deepanshu Verma<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-21.html'>Optimal Experimental Design and Robust Optimization for Large-Scale Inverse Problems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>This talk presents recent advances in neural network approaches for approximating the value function of high-dimensional control problems. A core challenge of the training process is that the value function estimate and the relevant parts of the state space (those likely to be visited by optimal policies) need to be discovered. We show how insights from optimal control theory can be leveraged to achieve these goals.  To focus the sampling on relevant states during neural network training, we use the Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP) to obtain the optimal controls for the current value function estimate. Our approaches can handle both stochastic and deterministic control problems. Our training loss consists of a weighted sum of the objective functional of the control problem and penalty terms that enforce the HJB equations along the sampled trajectories.  Importantly, training is self-supervised, in that, it does not require solutions of the control problem.      We will present several numerical experiments for deterministic and stochastic problems with state dimensions of about 100 and compare our methods to existing approaches.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75225' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(315)' class='star'><span class='star315'>&star;</span></a> Fred Vermolen  <span id='bitlink-3677'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3677)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3677' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3677)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b> Neural Networks Accelerated Simulations for Burn Contraction</b><br />Fred Vermolen<br />Friday, March 3 12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-69.html'>Data-Driven Methods in Computational Biomechanics - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>Patients with severe burn injuries often suffer from hypertrophic scars, which impair their aesthetic appearance. Next to hypertrophy, skin contraction is a common long-term side effect. If contraction has reached the extent that patients suffer from joint immobility, then the contraction is referred to as a contracture. In order to devise therapies that prevent the formation of contractures, it is important to be acquainted with the underlying biological mechanisms. Since clinical observations are represented in terms of patterns and numbers, mathematical quantification in order to validate biological theory is indispensable. Since the model formulations consist of a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, the finite element strategies result in expensive simulations. In particular, the assessment of uncertainty quantification used to estimate the probability distribution of medical scenarios makes the computations very expensive. In order to have feasible access to the simulations in clinical settings, the simulations are accelerated using artificial intelligence by means of feed-forward neural networks. During the presentation, the mathematical model and the applied artificial intelligence model will be introduced.

The many in this context is about a thousand.  Path trackers repeatedly run Newton's method, evaluating and differentiating  polynomials, followed by the solution of a linear system.  On Taylor series,  the matrices are block Toeplitz lower triangular, obtained by convolutions.    
Proximity to singularities requires multiple double precision arithmetic,  which causes a cost overhead to be offset by acceleration with Graphics  Processing Units (GPUs).  In particular, GPUs capable of teraflop  performance compensate for the overhead caused by quad double arithmetic.  Multiple double precision is necessary to adjust the parameter representation  in case the radius of convergence of the Taylor series is too small.    
Singularities are located efficiently via the quadratically converging  Newton's method at regular points and with extrapolation on the series.  While the current implementation takes polynomials on input, viewing   polynomials as truncated series extends its application to analytic systems,  systems of functions with well defined Taylor series developments.

As a consequence of Bloch’s theorem, the numerical computation of electronic quantities of interest involves computing derivatives or integrals over the Brillouin zone of so-called energy bands, which are piecewise smooth, Lipschitz continuous periodic functions obtained by solving a parametrized elliptic eigenvalue problem on a Hilbert space of periodic functions. Classic discretization strategies for resolving these eigenvalue problems produce approximate energy bands that are either non-periodic or discontinuous, both of which cause difficulty when computing numerical derivatives or employing numerical quadrature.     
We present here an alternative discretization strategy based on an ad hoc operator modification approach. While specific instances of this approach have been proposed in the physics literature, we describe a systematic formulation of this operator modification approach. We derive a priori error estimates for the resulting energy bands and we show that these bands are periodic and can be made arbitrarily smooth (away from band crossings) by adjusting suitable parameters in the operator modification approach.   We also present numerical experiments involving a toy model in 1D, graphene in 2D, and silicon in 3D to validate our theoretical results and showcase the efficiency of the operator modification approach.

The multi-scale nature of those equations leads to numerical challenges in terms of asymptotic behaviour to recover all Knudsen number flows. Considering this challenge, the UGKS (Unified Gaz Kinetic scheme) has been developed by K. Xu for the BGK model. This characteristic based scheme correctly captures both the continuum and rarefied flow regimes, with a time step much larger than the collision time. However, the problem’s dimension induces a huge computational cost.    
Under certain assumptions, moments models of those kinetic equations allow to reduce the velocity space dimension by assuming the distribution function shape. Elaborating robust asymptotic preserving schemes for those models is also challenging. Following L. Mieussens work on an adaptation of UGKS to a linear kinetic model of radiative transfer theory, we propose a new numerical scheme based on UGKS for the associated M1 model. We prove that this new scheme preserves the moments achievability and ensures the entropy decreases.

We apply the RL algorithm to optimally calibrate continuum plastic flow material models that capture the strain history dependence of materials exhibiting elastoplastic response. Although a subject matter expert can select experiments based on prior knowledge, as the complexity (anisotropy) of the model grows, so does the parameter space, and therefore it becomes increasingly difficult for a human expert to design a minimal set of experiments that simultaneously satisfy budget constraints and accuracy requirements. We cast the design of experiments as a game of traversing a decision tree to reach an optimally calibrated model at the end of the tree. Each decision represents an experimental control action. The material response is passed to an extended switching Kalman filter, which performs a Bayesian update of the model parameters and relays the information gain reward to the agent.

In particular, we focus on a high-fidelity numerical database of a simplified urban environment. The proposed technique relies on beta-variational autoencoders (beta-VAEs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which enable extracting non-linear modes while encouraging the learning of statistically-independent latent variables and penalizing the size of the latent vector. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm for ordering the resulting modes with respect to their contribution to the reconstruction. We demonstrate that by constraining the shape of the latent space, it is possible to motivate orthogonality and extract a set of parsimonious modes which enable high-quality reconstruction. Our results show the excellent performance of the method in the reconstruction against linear-theory-based decompositions, where the energy percentage captured by the proposed method from five modes is equal to 87.36% against 32.41% from POD.

The key feature - and the expense - of the SBM is how the boundary conditions (BCs) are applied on a surrogate/approximate boundary via the use of Taylor expansions to ensure that the convergence rates of the overall discrete formulation is preserved, see [Main and Scovazzi, 2017 and 2018]. This original work by Main & Scovazzi was exploiting the classical - second-order accurate - Finite Element Method (FEM), however, higher-order contributions have recently been made, see [Nouveau et al., 2019] and [Atallah et al., 2022]. A high-order numerical method is the Galerkin-based Spectral Element Method (SEM) [Xui et al., 2018] which can be viewed as a multi-domain version of the single-domain polynomial spectral method.     
We present a SEM-based model combined with the SBM for solving the Poisson equation in 2D on different domains/geometries with various BCs. Convergence studies are performed to establish the legitimacy of the work, including considerations of matrix conditioning when imposing Dirichlet BCs weakly via Nitsche's method. Also, the presented work is free of higher-order derivatives from the aforementioned Taylor expansions, as the formulation utilizes the polynomial behaving nature of the basis functions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75754' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(836)' class='star'><span class='star836'>&star;</span></a> Giuseppe Visconti  <span id='bitlink-3684'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3684)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3684' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3684)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Quinpi: Constructing Implicit High Order Schemes for Hyperbolic Systems</b><br />Giuseppe Visconti<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-183.html'>High Order Numerical Methods for Hyperbolic PDEs and Multiphysics Phenomena</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>Many interesting applications of hyperbolic systems of equations are stiff, and require the time step to satisfy restrictive stability conditions. One way to avoid small time steps is to use implicit time integration. Implicit integration is quite straightforward for first order schemes. This talk is concerned with the challenges of writing high order implicit schemes for hyperbolic systems. High order schemes need to control spurious oscillations, which requires limiting in space and time also in the implicit case. We propose a framework to simplify considerably the application of high order non oscillatory schemes through the introduction of a low order implicit predictor, which is used both to set up the nonlinear weights of a standard high order space reconstruction, and to achieve limiting in time. In this talk, we concentrate on the case of a third order scheme, based on DIRK integration in time and CWENO reconstruction in space.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75485' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(964)' class='star'><span class='star964'>&star;</span></a> Sumit K.

The three-dimensional linearized theory of elastic waves and the piecewise homogeneous body model has been employed to formulate the problem. The mathematical modelling has been carried out in two independent cases. In the first case a solid cylinder encased in a hollow cylinder embedded in an infinite elastic medium has been considered. Whereas second case comprises of hollow cylinder of finite thickness in place of solid cylinder. By means of Murnaghan potential the mechanical characteristics of the three materials have been used. Further, the dispersion relations for both the cases have been obtained in terms of the Bessel and modified Bessel functions. In order to validate the present findings, two particular cases have derived which matches with the previous works. The first case is obtained by removing the outermost cylinder while the second case has been derived by removing the imperfection in addition to that. To summarize the computations, a complete numerical simulation has been carried out, and graphical illustrations have been shown to aid the mathematical analyses.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75521' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(456)' class='star'><span class='star456'>&star;</span></a> Federico Vismara  <span id='bitlink-3686'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3686)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3686' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3686)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structure Preserving Hyper-Reduction of Parametric Hamiltonian Systems</b><br />Federico Vismara<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-101.html'>High-Dimensional Approximation and Reduced-Order Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Many conservative processes in a wide range of physical and engineering applications can be modelled by Hamiltonian systems. The dynamics of such systems is described by the gradient of a scalar function, the Hamiltonian, which is preserved over time. Since the number of degrees of freedom required to provide accurate numerical solutions can be very large, model order reduction and hyper-reduction methods are typically used to achieve computational speedups, in particular in many-query simulations. However, traditional hyper-reduction techniques, such as discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM), fail to preserve the gradient structure of the flow velocity, which might lead to unphysical and unstable solutions. Furthermore, conservative phenomena do not exhibit global reducibility properties, in the sense that large approximation spaces are usually needed to accurately approximate the full order solution. To overcome these issues, we construct adaptive hyper-reduced models that retain the gradient structure and whose complexity is independent of the dimension of the full order problem. Finally, in order to exploit the local low-rank nature of conservative phenomena, both the reduced space and the DEIM basis are updated in time. In this talk, we will discuss this adaptive approach and present several numerical results.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75372' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1079)' class='star'><span class='star1079'>&star;</span></a> Konstantinos Vlachas  <span id='bitlink-3687'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3687)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3687' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3687)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structural Condition Monitoring Using Parametric Reduced Order Models and Limited Output Measurements</b><br />Konstantinos Vlachas<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:45 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-237.html'>Recent Advances in Nonlinear Model Reduction for Computational Mechanics - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Structural and mechanical systems are oftentimes subjected to damage, which impels the vibration response beyond the normal operational regime.  Apart from challenging the system's serviceability and integrity, these events pose a limit to the versatility and applicability of structural health monitoring strategies. The present works addresses the challenges associated with the response prediction and parameter identification of systems subjected to such events in the context of vibration-based structural health monitoring. The proposed approach relies on projection-based Reduced Order Models for the representation of system dynamics, which are tailored to an inverse framework that aims to estimate characteristic traits of the system's state and features of the induced damage.  To assess the damage evolution and capture the changes in system parameters over time, the ROMs are used as predictors in the context of a sequential Bayesian inference problem, whereby the physics is fused with vibration response measurements. This approach allows recursive state or damage-related parameter estimation through a bank of filters and an evolution strategy that captures the parametrized states' dynamics. By continuously monitoring damage-related features and tracking the system's traits, the proposed framework aims to provide an indirect evaluation of the system's condition, while quantifying the induced damage.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75560' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1172)' class='star'><span class='star1172'>&star;</span></a> Vojtech Vlcek  <span id='bitlink-3688'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3688)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3688' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3688)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Finding Quasiparticles in Dynamically Correlated Systems</b><br />Vojtech Vlcek<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-257.html'>High-Performance Algorithms for Large Scale Eigenvalue Problems in Physical Simulations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>Capturing the dynamics of electronic excitations in realistic systems containing more than a few electrons is one of the outstanding theoretical challenges. Dynamical quantum correlations mediate interactions and couplings between multiple excited states in materials and represent an important driver of their optoelectronic characteristics. Practical simulations resort to a quasiparticle picture in which the large-scale (and practically intractable) many-body problem is downfolded onto an effective single or few quasiparticle systems. This low-dimensional representation requires space-time non-local operators (capturing the renormalization of one- and two-body interactions) and leads to non-linear eigenvalue problems. I will discuss the first-principles techniques for studying individual excited states within the quasiparticle picture in molecules and large-scale condensed systems and outline the challenges associated with these approaches. I will exemplify these methods by exploring the correlated phenomena for localized moire states in twisted bilayer graphene and quantum defects.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75589' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(866)' class='star'><span class='star866'>&star;</span></a> Tristan G.

We present a method based on a lattice-Boltzmann fluid coupled to point particles that interact with each other via the Discrete Element Method. Two-way coupling between the solid and fluid phases is used. The effect of (locally) large solid volume fractions on the fluid is  accounted for by using a lattice-Boltzmann formulation based on the generalized Navier-Stokes equations.    
  We discuss how intricacies of the coupling scheme must be considered to avoid unphysical behavior and instabilities which were reported in previous studies. Through this analysis, we identify under what conditions the model can be expected to yield accurate results. The method is validated by comparison to experiments and established numerical studies. Our method is built upon the LBM solver Musubi and scales well on the Dutch supercomputer Snellius. It is especially suitable for simulating flows containing many small particles in complex geometries.    
To demonstrate this, we apply our method to study the distribution of particles injected from a catheter into an arterial geometry. Various catheter positions are evaluated, showing how the model could be used to optimize treatment in targeted drug delivery applications. In future work we will apply our model to realistic anatomic geometries to study the injection of radioactive particles in radioembolization, a treatment for liver cancer.

Those processes are partitioned into individual models that, along with the associated numerical discretization, are each developed more-or-less independently of the others, which has resulted in process coupling that remains essentially a sequential splitting approach. Thus, this work leverages a semi-discrete error analysis framework to investigate the potential both of alternative coupling approaches in the literature and of new coupling approaches developed specifically to the software architecture of the E3SM atmosphere model (EAM). The analysis framework isolates the coupling error from that of the temporal and spatial discretization, avoiding the need to rederive error terms for each combination of coupling approach and temporal and/or spatial discretization present in EAM. By leveraging such analysis, an alternative coupling approach for aerosol processes has been developed that substantially improves dust lifetime simulation, which is crucial to reliable climate prediction. Both the improvement in aerosol process coupling and the progress on improving coupling between other atmosphere processes will be presented.

In this talk, our focus will be on port-Hamiltonian systems. In the context of model reduction, it is often desired to obtain a reduced-order model of the same structure to benefit from the same structural properties of the original model such as stability or passivity. In our framework this goal is achieved by parametrizing a reduced-order model of prescribed structure and then optimizing the parameters with respect to a specially designed objective functional that typically results in reduced-order models with small (and often, close-to-optimal) $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-error. Likewise, in the context of designing $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-controllers for port-Hamiltonian plant models, one can parametrize a low-order port-Hamiltonian controller that is in negative feedback interconnection with the plant. This construction automatically leads to stable closed-loop systems and the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-performance can be optimized using a similar objective functional as in model reduction.

The model accounts for various modes of non-equilibrium, which are characteristic for plasma plumes induced by short- and ultra-short pulses. It includes a two-temperature model of the irradiated target, a kinetic model for flow of atoms and ions, and a continuum model for electrons in gaseous plasma. The model of plasma plume is implemented as a part of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The classical DSMC method is combined with the collision-radiation (CR) model using an approach, when a simulate particle represents both ions and atoms in multiple excited states. In the CR model, non-equilibrium distribution of ions, elastic collisions between electrons and ions, multiphoton ionization, inverse Bremsstrahlung, electron impact ionization, three-body recombination, as well as plasma emission are accounted for.

The first model calculates subsidence for a single observation point due to a single source and considers independent and uncorrelated parameters and observations.  The second model calculates the observed subsidence as a summation of subsidence contributions from multiple sources.  In the latter model, the spatial response that a single subsidence source causes at the surface will result in correlated observations. The correlation in the resulting observations may trigger weight collapse in the particle method.    
The information loss related to the spatial correlation can be quantified with mutual information.  Using the quantification of information loss, we illustrate how this loss of information is reflected in the log-likelihood of the estimation problem, and how this depends on the number of parameters of the model.

In this work, we construct hypernetwork-based latent dynamical models directly on the parameter space of a compact representation network. We leverage the expressive power of the network and a specially designed consistency-inducing regularization to obtain latent trajectories that are both low-dimensional and smooth. These properties render our surrogate models highly efficient at inference time.

However, training them to capture fine details in multi-scale signals is difficult and computationally expensive. Here we propose random weight factorization as a simple drop-in replacement of conventional dense layers for accelerating and improving the training of coordinate-based multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We show that this factorization essentially alters the loss landscape and effectively enables each neuron in the network to learn its own self-adaptive learning rate. As a result, it not only helps with mitigating spectral bias, but also allows networks to quickly recover from poor initializations and reach better local minima. We demonstrate how random weight factorization can be leveraged to accelerate and improve the training of neural representations on a variety of tasks, including image regression, shape representation, computed tomography, inverse rendering, solving partial differential equations, and learning operators between function spaces.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75623' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1812)' class='star'><span class='star1812'>&star;</span></a> Tim Warburton  <span id='bitlink-3703'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3703)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3703' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3703)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Accelerating Very High-Order Finite Element Operations with GPU Matrix-Cores</b><br />Tim Warburton<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-399.html'>Exascale Software and Algorithms for High-Order PDE Solvers - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>We will discuss the challenges in achieving high performance for the DOE ECP CEED bake-off problems on the latest NVIDIA and AMD server grade GPUs.

Here, we present preliminary work on pyop3, a new domain-specific language embedded in Python for automating mesh-based simulations.    
The primary contribution of pyop3 is the introduction of a hierarchical data layout language that associates topological information with the locations of the degrees-of-freedom. This enables a generic description for any partial structure in the mesh; for example extrusion or refinement. With such a description, we exploit this structure to avoid extraneous indirect addressing, and the resulting penalty of additional data movement, resulting in possible order-of-magnitude increases in performance.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75323' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(399)' class='star'><span class='star399'>&star;</span></a> Jerry Watkins  <span id='bitlink-3705'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3705)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3705' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3705)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Performance Portable Extensions to Ice-Sheet Modeling in Mali</b><br />Jerry Watkins<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-89.html'>Advanced Computational Methods for Ice-Sheet Modeling and Analysis - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>The road to exascale computing has introduced a need to redesign our scientific software for new computing architectures that require a fundamentally different programming model.

The convergence rate of classic DDMs in general deteriorates severly for coefficient distributions with large contrasts in the coefficient function.  To retain the robustness for such problems, the coarse space of the DDM can be enriched by additional coarse basis functions, often obtained by solving local generalized eigenvalue problems.  However, the set-up and the solution of these eigenvalue problems typically takes up a significant part of the total time to solution. Additionally, for many realistic problems, only the solution of a small number of the eigenvalue problems is necessary to design a robust algorithm. In general, it is difficult to predict a priori which of the eigenvalue problems are needed.  Using a neural network model we can predict the geometric location where eigenvalue problems have to be solved, often reducing its number significantly (joint work of the authors with Alexander Heinlein). To obtain such an a priori classification, we use a mesh-independent sampling strategy which is comparable to an image recognition problem.  In a next step, we train a surrogate model which directly learns the necessary coarse basis functions themselves using again an image representation of the underlying coefficient function.   Numerical results indicate the robustness of this approach.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75727' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(772)' class='star'><span class='star772'>&star;</span></a> Nils Wedi  <span id='bitlink-3709'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3709)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3709' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3709)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>DestinE - Digital Twins of the Earth System</b><br />Nils Wedi<br />Friday, March 3 11:30 AM&ndash;11:41 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-169.html'>Advances in High Performance Computing for Earth Science - Part II of II</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>As part of the European Commission's Destination Earth programme, global, coupled storm-resolving simulations can contribute to building digital replicas of Earth, thanks to recent advances in Earth system modelling, supercomputing and the adaptation of weather and climate codes for novel computing architectures. Combined with novel data-driven deep learning advances, this offers a window into the future, with a promise to significantly increase the timeliness and realism of Earth system information. Despite the significant compute and data challenges, there is a real prospect to better support global to local climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, and complement today's existing information. Digital Twins of Earth thus encapsulate both the latest science as well as technology advances to provide near-real time information on Extremes and climate change in a wider digital environment. Here users can interact, modify and ultimately create or complement their own tailored information. Partnering with ESA and EUMETSAT, this is facilitated through complex workflows akin to a game engine environment provided by ECMWF's digital twin engine that closely connects EuroHPC resources for the production of and access to digital twin data.

Yet, they are frequently perceived as black-box tools, whose results may be difficult to interpret. To address this issue, several methods have been proposed to obtain maps of relevance scores highlighting the importance of different time steps for a given model. These methods were initially applied to images, and more recently to time-series data. Yet, interpretability of NN remains challenging. Trust in these interpretability methods will only be brought through a formal evaluation of their performance, which has been studied but with some drawbacks. These methods typically provide different evaluations of importance, sometimes even diametrically opposite results, and do not explain how neurons collaborate to represent specific patterns. Some studies, therefore, aim to introduce novel metrics to rank interpretability methods across the most commonly used machine learning (ML) models. Another aspect of the research focuses on developing novel interpretability methods to provide more meaningful insights for practitioners working with ML models. In this work, we extend interpretability methods to recognize patterns indicative of a given class across samples. We argue that this work is a critical step toward understanding NN-based decisions for a given classification task at a more holistic dataset scale, rather than the individual sample.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75381' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2070)' class='star'><span class='star2070'>&star;</span></a> Tobias Weinzierl  <span id='bitlink-3711'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3711)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3711' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3711)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Flavours of GPU Kernels in ExaHyPE</b><br />Tobias Weinzierl<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-286.html'>SYCL's Impact on Algorithms, Data Structures and Implementations - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>ExaHyPE is an engine to solve hyperbolic PDEs in first order formulation over dynamically adaptive meshes.  The code supports classic non-overlapping domain decomposition supplemented by tasks.  At runtime, ExaHyPE assembles batches of tasks and deploys them to GPUs.  For various numerical schemes, we offer various generic, i.e. PDE-independent GPU kernels.  By default, they rely on OpenMP GPU offloading.  This talk reflects on our recent endeavour how to translate these OpenMP kernels into SYCL.  Some concepts from the OpenMP world translate one-to-one, while others cannot directly be mapped onto SYCL.  In return, SYCL streamlines the realisation of certain flavours of GPU kernels which are technically challenging in OpenMP.  The two paradigms require a rethink of the kernel realisations.

Due to fast reactions and small spatial extent of activation fronts, small time steps and mesh widths are required for a sufficiently accurate discretization, incurring a substantial computational effort.  The highly localized dynamics of these models call for adaptive simulation methods. Unfortunately, the overhead incurred by classical mesh adaptivity turns out to outweigh the performance improvements achieved by reducing the problem size.    
Here, we explore a different approach to adaptivity based on progressive subset selection of algebraic degrees of freedom during time stepping with spectral deferred correction methods. This realizes a kind of multirate higher order integration but allows for a natural and efficient definition of artificial boundary conditions justified by a priori error estimates based on the maximum principle. Numerical experience indicates a significant performance increase compared to  simulations on uniform grids.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75653' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(361)' class='star'><span class='star361'>&star;</span></a> Max Welling  <span id='bitlink-3713'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3713)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3713' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3713)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Will Neural PDE Surrogates Disrupt the Field of PDE Solving?</b><br />Max Welling<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-80.html'>Advances in Deep Neural Operators - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75335' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1894)' class='star'><span class='star1894'>&star;</span></a> Harry Wells  <span id='bitlink-3714'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3714)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3714' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3714)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Moving Mesh Virtual Element Methods</b><br />Harry Wells<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(305)' class='star'><span class='star305'>&star;</span></a> Yuxiao Wen  <span id='bitlink-3715'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3715)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3715' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3715)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Sampling for Efficiently Training Models of Nonlinear Latent Dynamics</b><br />Yuxiao Wen<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-67.html'>Nonlinear Approximations of Latent Dynamics for Model Reduction and Beyond - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>A typical approach for training nonlinear parametrizations such as deep neural networks to approximate solutions of partial differential equations is to minimize the residual at collocation points. However, if the spatial domain is high-dimensional or the dynamics are transport dominated with local features such as waves, then just uniformly sampling collocation points becomes intractable because each collocation point entails at least one residual evaluation in each iteration of the training. In this work, we propose an active learning scheme that adapts collocation points to follow the dynamics described by the partial differential equations. This means that the solution dynamics are leveraged to adapt collocation points to where the residual is high. In experiments with high-dimensional evolution equations and equations that transport local features such as waves, the proposed active scheme learns accurate approximations of the solutions from few samples whereas traditional collocation methods based on static sampling fail to provide meaningful predictions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75310' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(713)' class='star'><span class='star713'>&star;</span></a> Holger Wendland  <span id='bitlink-3716'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3716)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3716' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3716)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On the Approximability and Curse of Dimensionality of Certain Classes of High-Dimensional Functions</b><br />Holger Wendland<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-157.html'>Perspectives in Modern Kernel Approximation Methods - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G104<br /><br /><small>In this talk, I will discuss the approximability of high-dimensional  functions that appear, for example, in the context of many body expansions and hdmr  (high dimensional model representation).

Iterative numerical techniques are becoming popular to scale to larger datasets, relying on the conjugate gradient method (CG) for the linear solves and stochastic trace estimation for the log-determinant. This work introduces new algorithmic and theoretical insights for preconditioning these computations. While preconditioning is well understood in the context of CG, we demonstrate that it can also accelerate convergence and reduce variance of the estimates for the log-determinant and its derivative. We prove general probabilistic error bounds for the preconditioned computation of the log-determinant, log-marginal likelihood and its derivatives. Additionally, we derive specific rates for a range of kernel-preconditioner combinations, showing that up to exponential convergence can be achieved. Our theoretical results enable provably efficient optimization of kernel hyperparameters, which we validate empirically on large-scale benchmark problems. There our approach accelerates training by up to an order of magnitude.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75365' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1716)' class='star'><span class='star1716'>&star;</span></a> Tizian Wenzel  <span id='bitlink-3718'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3718)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3718' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3718)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Two Layered Kernel Machines for Sparse Surrogate Modeling</b><br />Tizian Wenzel<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-379.html'>High-Fidelity and Data-Driven Methods for Multiscale and Multi-Physics Problems - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>Kernel methods are popular, especially using easily implementable radial basis function (RBF) kernels.

In this work, we propose a data-driven approach that guarantees finding stabilizing controllers from as few data samples as the dimension of the unstable dynamics, which typically is orders of magnitude lower than the state dimension of the system. The key is learning stabilizing controllers directly from data without learning models of the systems, which would require larger numbers of data points. Numerical experiments with chemical reactors and fluid dynamics behind obstacles demonstrate that the proposed approach stabilizes systems after observing fewer than five data samples even though the dimension of states is orders of magnitude higher.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75415' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1882)' class='star'><span class='star1882'>&star;</span></a> Scott R.

Our work at LLNL focuses on developing digital twins of additive manufacturing (AM) systems and processes with the goal of virtually designing and optimizing 3D printed components before needing to manufacture them.     
Currently, we manufacture mission-critical components from direct-ink-write AM systems and manually inspect and test parts. Using on-board sensor data from cameras and kinematic motion data, our work aims to automate the inspection and testing process by geometrically tolerancing parts with deep learning and computer vision. Furthermore, we aim to improve the accuracy of our process-scale digital twin of the 3D printing process by injecting real sensor noise into the simulator. We also compare our digital and physical twins in a virtual reality (VR) environment, allowing for intuitive interactions among multiple collaborators who need not be co-located.     
Using in situ process monitoring, data-driven prediction enhancement, and VR, we hope to yield insights into machine health, preventative maintenance, and corrective strategies with the goal of moving toward AM process certification.

In this work, we provide a novel formulation of a Bayesian OED problem that couples the goal-oriented experimental design and optimal control problems, thus minimizing uncertainty in the control objective directly. Through a numerical example, we illustrate how the resulting control-oriented OED approach leads to a better allocation of experimental resources that decreases uncertainty regarding the optimal control policy in comparison to classical OED strategies.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75555' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1897)' class='star'><span class='star1897'>&star;</span></a> Stefan Wild  <span id='bitlink-3724'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3724)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3724' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3724)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Accelerating Randomized Algorithms for Massive-Scale Zeroth-Order Optimization</b><br />Stefan Wild<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(319)' class='star'><span class='star319'>&star;</span></a> Tim Wildey  <span id='bitlink-3725'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3725)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3725' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3725)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimal Experimental Design for Prediction for Data-Consistent Inversion</b><br />Tim Wildey<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-70.html'>Model Error-Aware Methods for Inverse Problems and Experimental Design</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />E106<br /><br /><small>One of the ultimate goals in science is to develop a symbiotic relationship between two of the pillars, experimentation and simulation, where the data from the experiments informs the computational models and the computational models are used to guide the optimal acquisition of new data.  In many situations, the collection of experimental data can be costly and time consuming. Thus, we may only be able to afford to perform a limited number of experiments, so we must choose the experiments that are likely to produce informative data. Moreover, the optimality of the experiment must be chosen with respect to the ultimate objective. We present a mathematically rigorous approach for optimal experimental design for data-consistent inversion. Data-consistent inversion is a relatively new approach for solving a particular class of stochastic inverse problems where a probability measure is sought on model inputs such that the corresponding push-forward measure matches a given target measure.  We demonstrate that the optimal experimental design often depends on whether our objective is to characterize the uncertainty in model input parameters or in the prediction of quantities of interest that cannot be observed directly. Numerical results will be presented to illustrate both types of optimal experimental design and to highlight the differences.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75317' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1138)' class='star'><span class='star1138'>&star;</span></a> Rostislav-Paul Wilhelm  <span id='bitlink-3726'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3726)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3726' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3726)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Numerical Flow Iteration for the Vlasov-Poisson Equation</b><br />Rostislav-Paul Wilhelm<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-250.html'>Efficient Numerical Frameworks for Kinetic And Related Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>The Vlasov-Poisson equation is a high-dimensional partial differential equation used to model the behaviour   of plasmas in the collision-less limit. The six-dimensional phase-space and the turbulent motion of plasmas   together with formation of strong filamentation in the solution lead to significant complications in the   implementation of solvers. While purely Lagrangian schemes are in theory capable to capture the dynamics   correctly, the inherent numerical noise makes it hard to run long-time accurate simulations and requires   large numbers of particles as well as remeshing.   Eulerian and Semi-Lagrangian schemes produce more accurate results, however,   generation and management of meshes are prohibitively expensive for simulations in more than four dimensions.   In addition, when constructing high-order schemes one often looses conservation properties of the exact solution.    
We present a novel approach, the numerical flow iteration (NuFI), which iteratively reconstructs the phase flow   and then using the method of characteristics can evaluate the distribution function to arbitrary precision,   i.e., up to error in time and Poisson discretisation.   This approach naturally preserves non-negativity, does not struggle with over-shoots and conserves all $L^p$   norms exactly. From the implementation perspective, a high flop-byte ratio as well as a structure which allows   for easy parallelization of this method, lead to efficient portability to modern clusters.

In particular, we show that a proximal policy optimization algorithm can successfully identify a near-optimal strategy for positioning sinks within a simplified PDE model of contaminant flow.  The generality of the underlying learning scheme, along with the promising results from initial experiments, suggest that reinforcement learning may provide an effective framework for optimizing the decision-making process in a wide range of scientific applications.

Despite these efficiency benefits, they are still not used in many application areas, including non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.  In this work we explore the use of adaptive step integration methods for the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE) which give Green’s function information for a quantum system.  Because of the need for including the full time history in the solution of this system of two-time integral equations, constant step size methods have traditionally been used.  This presentation will overview adaptive time integrator technologies and discuss their implementation within the FASTMath time integration software suite, SUNDIALS.  We will then show the potential benefits of these adaptive methods for the KBE system and discuss targeted extensions within the SUNDIALS CVODE integrator to provide adaptive methods for two-time systems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75274' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1971)' class='star'><span class='star1971'>&star;</span></a> Carol S.

In search of a more efficient entropy conservative scheme, we investigate and analyze properties of a discretization based on the idea of entropy-splitting. The main ingredients of the scheme are Harten's entropy functions, diagonal-E summation-by-parts operator with diagonal norm matrix, and entropy conservative or stable simultaneous approximation terms (SATs). We show that the scheme is high-order accurate and entropy conservative on general curvilinear unstructured grids for the Euler equations. In the special cases of constant density or zero heat conductivity, the scheme remains entropy stable for the Navier-Stokes equations if appropriate viscous SATs are used. Due to the splitting of the inviscid fluxes, the method is not conservative in the sense of Lax-Wendroff. To mitigate the effects of this loss of conservation, we propose a strategy to enforce local conservation in the vicinity of discontinuities without loss of entropy stability. To support the theoretical findings, several numerical investigations involving both smooth and discontinuous solutions are presented. Preliminary efficiency comparison studies in terms of the time required to compute the spatial residual terms are also included.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75419' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(715)' class='star'><span class='star715'>&star;</span></a> Grady B.

These surface PDEs arise in many areas of science and engineering, including models of atmospheric flows, chemical signaling on cell membranes, morphogenesis, and textures for computer graphics.  MGM uses a Poisson disk sampling-type technique for coarsening the point clouds and new meshfree restriction/interpolation operators based on polyharmonic splines for transferring information between the coarsened point clouds.  These components are then combined with standard smoothing and operator coarsening methods in a V-cycle iteration.  MGM is applicable to discretizations of elliptic PDEs based on various localized meshfree methods, including RBF finite differences (RBF-FD) and generalized finite differences (GFD).  We test MGM both as a standalone solver and preconditioner for Krylov subspace methods on several test problems using RBF-FD and GFD, and numerically analyze convergence rates, efficiency, and scaling with increasing point cloud sizes.  We also perform a side-by-side comparison to algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for solving the same systems.  Finally, we further demonstrate the effectiveness of MGM by applying it to three challenging applications on complicated surfaces: pattern formation, surface harmonics, and geodesic distance.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75453' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1787)' class='star'><span class='star1787'>&star;</span></a> James Wright  <span id='bitlink-3735'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3735)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3735' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3735)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Performance-Portable Implicit Scale-Resolving Compressible Flow Using libCEED</b><br />James Wright<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-393.html'>Exascale Applications of High-Order PDE Solvers - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D503<br /><br /><small>Unstructured mesh CFD solvers with second order accurate spatial discretizations are flexible and ubiquitous in industry.

Very little of it is organised in meaningful ways, making its discovery,   insight and   discussion harder every year. Following new developments in a given field is   time consuming even for experts. Entering a new specialisation is daunting for   students.    
We will show how building a knowledge graph for scientific computing can   address   these issues.  We have created an ontology that  semantically links mathematical problems with algorithms, publications and   implementations.  This ontology encodes possible relationships between the entities in the graph   and these  connections can be explored using our web-based query frontend.  This query frontend enables non-experts to quickly gain an overview of   available methods and  software for numerical problems in their scientific work.  The frontend makes variations of essentially the same algorithms easily   discoverable.  It allows tracking new publications or software implementations connected to a   certain  mathematical problem.    
We will be inviting feedback for our plans to grow this knowledge graph into a   community-driven platform  with an open, freely accessible API.    
Our efforts are part of the scientific computing task area in the Mathematical   Research Data Initiative (MaRDI),   a consortium in the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI).

Due to limited access to both trajectory and loop detector traffic data, we perform our analysis on synthetic data generated by numerical simulations.    
Classically, macroscopic traffic flow models are calibrated by fitting the so-called fundamental diagram i.e., the density-flow mapping described by the model flux function. However, data noise and congested traffic situations make the parameter identification process more difficult to deal with. Thus we consider an alternative approach based on [M. Kennedy, A. O'Hagan.   Bayesian calibration of computer models. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 2001] which introduces a bias term to better account for possible discrepancies between the mathematical model and reality; this bias term is modeled by a Gaussian process (GP). Once the calibration parameters are obtained, our analysis distinguishes between travel time estimation and prediction where the former is related to realized traffic scenarios. For the second one, we apply a  GP to predict future traffic conditions at loop detector locations and sparse time points. These serve as initial data to simulate the traffic conditions at a finer scale, which enables us to do travel time prediction. Finally we compare the travel times between the ground truth and simulated data observing that the usage of the physics model on top of the GP improves the prediction accuracy.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75520' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1435)' class='star'><span class='star1435'>&star;</span></a> Claire Wyatt  <span id='bitlink-3738'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3738)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3738' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3738)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Are You An RSE?</b><br />Claire Wyatt<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-316.html'>Towards Improvement of Sustainability and Productivity for Research Software - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Did you start off as a researcher who spent time developing software to progress your research and then realised you enjoyed this work more than research? Or maybe you started off from a more conventional software-development background and are drawn to research by the challenge of using software to further research?     
A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in programming with an intricate understanding of research. Although this combination of skills is extremely valuable, these people lack a formal place in the academic system. Without a job title, it is difficult for people to rally around a cause and there is no easy way to recognise their contribution, to reward them, or to represent their views.  So in 2012, the term Research Software Engineer was created in 2012 and the community is now working to raise awareness of the role, bring RSEs together and advocate for more appropriate career recognition and promotion.      
Regardless of your formal job title, the attraction of being a Research Software Engineer is similar to that of being a researcher: the role attracts people who want to know how the world works. The Research Software Engineer works with researchers to gain an understanding of the problems they face, and then develops, maintains and extends software to provide the answers.    
This talk will cover the history of the RSE movement, what it has achieved, what’s coming up in 2023 and how you can get involved.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75706' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1943)' class='star'><span class='star1943'>&star;</span></a> Henrik Wyschka  <span id='bitlink-3739'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3739)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3739' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3739)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Computing p-Harmonic Descent Directions and Their Limits for Shape Optimization</b><br />Henrik Wyschka<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(423)' class='star'><span class='star423'>&star;</span></a> Yuanzhe Xi  <span id='bitlink-3740'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3740)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3740' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3740)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Adaptive Factorized Nystrom Preconditioner for Gaussian Kernel Matrices</b><br />Yuanzhe Xi<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-94.html'>Efficient Numerical Linear Algebra Methods for Gaussian Processes</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>The spectrum of a kernel matrix significantly depends on the parameter  values of the kernel function used to define the kernel matrix.  This makes it challenging to design a preconditioner for a regularized  kernel matrix that is robust across different parameter values.  In this talk, we present the Adaptive Factorized Nystr\"om  (AFN) preconditioner.  The preconditioner is designed for  the case where the rank $k$ of the Nystr\"om approximation  is large, i.e., for kernel function parameters that lead to kernel  matrices with eigenvalues that decay slowly.  Other Nystr\"om preconditioners for a regularized kernel matrix use the  Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury (SMW) formula and must solve with or  compute an eigendecomposition of a $k$-by-$k$ matrix.  In contrast, AFN is a factorized form that avoids  the SMW formula.  It deliberately chooses a well-conditioned $k$-by-$k$  matrix to solve with that has a sparse approximate inverse. This makes  AFN efficient for large $k$.  AFN also adaptively  chooses $k$ to balance accuracy and cost.

The main novelty in the developed methods is the use of local basis functions defined at near-boundary grid points. The use of local basis functions allow unified numerical treatment of (i) explicitly and implicitly defined geometry; (ii) geometry of more complicated shapes, such as those with corners, multi-connected domain, etc; and (iii) different types of boundary conditions. This geometrically flexible approach with local basis functions is a complement and improvement to the traditional DPM with global basis function approaches, especially in the case where a large number of global basis functions are needed to resolve the boundary data, or where the optimal global basis functions are difficult to obtain. Another feature of this work is that fast Poisson solvers based on FFT can be employed for standard centered finite difference stencils regardless of the designed order of accuracy (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.). The techniques developed in this paper can also be applied to the numerical solutions of time-dependent partial differential equations, when implicit time stepping is employed.

However, even though these newly data-driven deep learning solvers could be very effective as soon as they have been properly trained, they can (in general) provide us with a solution of limited accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost in the training phase can be extremely expensive. In this talk, we presents some ways of hybridizing the newly emerging deep learning solvers and the more traditional numerical linear algebra techniques to let them benefit from each other. In the context of solving a 2D heterogeneous Helmholtz equation, we first focus on introducing some mathematical ingredients from classical iterative solver into the training phase of a recently proposed deep neural network solver. The main benefit is a significant improvement in the training phase that is more robust and faster, which turns out to be applicable to the testing process as well. Furthermore, once the network solvers have been properly trained, their inferences can be applied as a nonlinear preconditioner in the traditional flexible GMRES and flexible FOM methods. This part demonstrates that these hybrid variants have clear advantages over both the newly emerging deep neural network approach and the classical iterative Krylov solver in terms of both computational cost and accuracy of the computed solution.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75646' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(818)' class='star'><span class='star818'>&star;</span></a> Dongbin Xiu  <span id='bitlink-3743'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3743)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3743' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3743)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Parameter Estimation with Deep Neural Networks</b><br />Dongbin Xiu<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-179.html'>Uncertainty Quantification for Data-Intensive Inverse Problems and Learning - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75478' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(515)' class='star'><span class='star515'>&star;</span></a> Helen Xu  <span id='bitlink-3744'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3744)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3744' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3744)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Optimizing Locality in Dynamic Graph Data Structures</b><br />Helen Xu<br />Wednesday, March 1 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-113.html'>Sparse Computations in Science and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small>This talk discusses dynamic graph data structures and how to choose data structures that optimize for locality, which is key to performance in graph computations.

In this talk, I will present an inertial proximal SsGM for nonsmooth nonconvex stochastic optimization. Our method has guaranteed convergence even with delayed derivatives in a distributed environment. Convergence rate results are established to three problem classes: weakly-convex nonsmooth problems with a convex regularizer, composite nonconvex problems with a nonsmooth convex regularizer, and smooth nonconvex problems. In a distributed environment, the convergence rate of the proposed method will be slowed down by the information delay. Nevertheless, the slow-down effect will decay with the number of iterations for the latter two problem classes. We test the proposed method on three applications. The numerical results clearly demonstrate the advantages of using the inertial-based acceleration. Furthermore, we observe higher parallelization speed-up in asynchronous updates over the synchronous counterpart, though the former uses delayed derivatives.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75360' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(356)' class='star'><span class='star356'>&star;</span></a> Zhi-Qin Xu  <span id='bitlink-3747'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3747)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3747' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3747)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data in Deep Operator Learning</b><br />Zhi-Qin Xu<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:40 PM&ndash;4:55 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-79.html'>Advances in Deep Neural Operators - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />Forum Centre<br /><br /><small>In this talk, I will show the importance of data in deep operator learning.

Numerous favorable conditions for achieving Lagrange a-exponential synchronization and a-exponential convergence of the descriptive networks are constructed using additional inequalities and the Lyapunov method. Furthermore, the structure of the a-exponential convergence ball, in which the rate of convergence is linked with the system’s characteristics and order of differential, has also been demonstrated. These findings, which do not require consideration of the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium points, help to generalize and improve previous works and may be used to mono-stable and multi-stable of the FOCVNNs. The salient feature of the article is the graphical exhibition of the effectiveness of the proposed method by using numerical simulation for synchronization of a particular case of the considered fractional-order drive and response systems.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75623' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(428)' class='star'><span class='star428'>&star;</span></a> Ichi Yamazaki  <span id='bitlink-3750'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3750)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3750' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3750)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A New Mixed-Precision Benchmark for HP Computers</b><br />Ichi Yamazaki<br />Thursday, March 2 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-95.html'>Mixed Precision Algorithms in Numerical Linear Algebra - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D406<br /><br /><small>We present a new benchmark for high-performance (HP) computers.

The ensemble of a particular vector space and two choice vector operations (one addition-like for "bundling" and one outer-product-like for "binding") form what we call a "vector symbolic architecture" (VSA). While VSAs have been employed in numerous applications and studied empirically, many theoretical questions about VSAs remain open.    
We provide theoretical analyses for the representation capacities of two popular VSAs: MAP-I and MAP-B. Representation capacity refers to lower bounds on the dimensions of the VSA vectors required to perform certain symbolic tasks (such as testing for set membership and estimating set intersection sizes) to a sufficient degree of accuracy. Our analysis of MAP-I also demonstrates a connection between VSAs and sketching (dimensionality reduction) algorithms such as the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform. Time permitting, we will also describe a relationship between the MAP-I VSA to Hopfield networks, which are simple models for associative memory.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75447' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(586)' class='star'><span class='star586'>&star;</span></a> Lucia M.

We diagnose the disparity between online and offline performance of the trained emulators by identifying a subspace of the phase space that is prone to large errors and sparse samples, and develop a sampling algorithm to treat biases that stem from underrepresentation. This strategy can be used for regression tasks over long-tailed (and other imbalanced) distributions.   We find that error-prone samples often have larges shears in the wind profile– this is corroborated with physical intuition as large shears indicate many breaking levels, which requires a more complex, nonlocal computation.  To remedy this, we develop a sampling strategy that performs a parameterized histogram equalization.   The sampling algorithm uses a linear mapping from the original histogram to the uniform histogram parameterized by $t \in [0,1]$. Parameters $t$ and &#8220;maximum repeat' assign each bin a new probability. The new probability is applied in two different implementations: 1) by sampling the bins to adjust the training set distribution; 2) by weighting the loss function to achieve the same effect in expectation. We find that this strategy improves the errors at the tail of the distribution except at the extreme end, while maintaining minimal loss of accuracy at the peak of the distribution.

Existing methods that estimate brain microstructure parameters often use biophysical models that are a) based on analytical expressions of the diffusion MRI signal, b) arising from simplified geometrical models of neuronal tissue. We take a different approach by a) numerically solving a gold standard model for the diffusion MRI signals, given by the Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation that governs the transverse magnetization, b) while using realistic neuron geometries.    
In previous work, we created accurate finite element meshes for over 1000 realistic neurons whose surface descriptions have been uploaded to the database NeuroMorpho.Org, and solved the Bloch-Torrey equation to obtain the simulated diffusion MRI signals of these neurons in 64 diffusion directions and at 31 diffusion-encoding gradient strengths. In this work, this set of simulated data was used to train a support vector machine to estimate morphological parameters such as soma volume, dendrite volume, and dendrite total length.    
The results reveal that the direction-averaged dMRI signals are significantly related to certain morphological parameters, such as soma volume, soma volume fraction, etc. This study is part of the effort to show that machine learning algorithms can serve as an efficient estimator for certain neuroanatomical parameters in diffusion MRI experiments.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75265' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(553)' class='star'><span class='star553'>&star;</span></a> Masayuki Yano  <span id='bitlink-3759'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3759)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3759' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3759)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Nonlinear Model Reduction for Parametrized Transonic Aerodynamic Flows</b><br />Masayuki Yano<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:00 PM&ndash;4:15 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-121.html'>Model Order Reduction Methods for Parameterized Fluid Flows - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>We present a projection-based model reduction formulation that uses nonlinear approximation spaces to provide an efficient solution of transonic flows with parameter-dependent shocks.

In this paper, we propose diffusion-based, geometry-free, and learning-free methodologies to count the number of objects in images. The main idea is to represent each object by a unique index value regardless of its intensity or size, and to simply count the number of index values. First, we place different vectors, referred to as seed vectors, uniformly throughout the mask image. The mask image has boundary information of the objects to be counted. Secondly, the seeds are diffused using an edge-weighted harmonic variational optimization model within each object. We propose an efficient algorithm based on an operator splitting approach and alternating direction minimization method, and theoretical analysis of this algorithm is given. An optimal solution of the model is obtained when the distributed seeds are completely diffused such that there is a unique intensity within each object, which we refer to as an index. We refer to this approach as Counting Objects by Diffused Index (CODI). We explore scalar and multi-dimensional seed vectors. For Scalar seeds, we use Gaussian fitting in histogram to count, while for vector seeds, we exploit a high-dimensional clustering method for the final step of counting via clustering. We present counting results in various applications such as biological cells, agriculture, concert crowd, and transportation. Some comparisons with existing methods are presented.

Lattice basis reduction is a strong tool for solving lattice problems. Given a basis of a lattice, a reduction algorithm is to find a new basis of the same lattice whose basis vectors are relatively short and nearly orthogonal each other. In this talk, I introduce several reduction algorithms, such as the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) and the block Korkine-Zolotarev (BKZ) algorithms that are popular in cryptanalysis. I also describe mathematical properties of such reduction algorithms and demonstrate how a reduction algorithm can solve lattice problems.

Snapshot-based reduced-order modeling is one of the common remedies to the problem. However, the anatomical geometries used for simulations are either segmented from clinical image data or generated indirectly by computational models, which are typically unparameterized and lead to distinct spatial discretisations.     
In this work, a data-driven surrogate model based on non-intrusive reduced-order modelling with surface registration is proposed. The surrogate model approximates the fluid dynamics of blood flow within vessels of distinct but similar shapes. Different from existing approaches, the proposed surrogate model performs a surface registration to approximate the shape of the target domain from the reference shape. The diffeomorphism constructed during surface registration provides the mapping between the reference domain and the target domain, as well as the parametrisation of the shape. The simulations are subsequently performed on the reference domain to ensure the spatial compatibility of the snapshots. Proper orthogonal decomposition is applied to construct reduced bases and the projection coefficients are computed via a radial basis function interpolation method. Two numerical examples based on stenosis and bifurcation vessels are presented and discussed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the surrogate model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75223' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1142)' class='star'><span class='star1142'>&star;</span></a> Erika Ye  <span id='bitlink-3765'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3765)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3765' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3765)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Quantum-Inspired Method for Solving the Vlasov Equation</b><br />Erika Ye<br />Thursday, March 2 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-250.html'>Efficient Numerical Frameworks for Kinetic And Related Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Recently, it has been proposed that matrix product states (MPS), a quantum-inspired but classical algorithm, can be used to approximately solve partial differential equations with exponential speed-up, provided that the PDE is compressible or low-rank so that it can be efficiently represented in the MPS framework.

On the other hand, the data is sometimes distributed to multiple parties, and it is difficult to share the original data due to privacy requirements. As a result, the data in one party may lack useful information to learn the most discriminative features. We introduce a collaborative feature selection method for multiple parties without revealing their original data. Each party constructs the intermediate representations of the original data and shares the intermediate representations for collaborative feature selection. Based on the shared intermediate representations, the original data from multiple parties are transformed into a common latent space. The feature ranking of the original data is learned by imposing row sparsity on the transformation matrix simultaneously. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75515' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(592)' class='star'><span class='star592'>&star;</span></a> H.C.

The so-called stiff source term problem of LeVeque & Yee (1990) is one well-known example. This problem manifests itself as discontinuities that propagate with the wrong speed when the numerical solution is under resolved and/or too diffusive in both space and time. The construction of numerical methods for (a) stable and accurate simulation of turbulence with strong shocks, and for (b) obtaining the correct propagation speed of discontinuities in the presence of stiff reacting terms share one important ingredient - minimization of numerical  dissipation while maintaining numerical stability. The dual requirement to achieve both numerical stability and minimal numerical dissipation are often conflicting for existing shock capturing schemes for flows with turbulence and discontinuities or stiff source terms.  During the last decade, Wang et al., Yee et al., Sjogreen & Yee have developed highly accurate structure preserving numerical methods with very small numerical dissipation that maintain nonlinear stability for compressible turbulence with strong shocks. This talk gives a brief overview of the quantification of numerical uncertainty via a nonlinear dynamics approach to complement existing uncertainty quantification in numerical simulations.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75418' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(246)' class='star'><span class='star246'>&star;</span></a> Liam Yemm  <span id='bitlink-3768'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3768)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3768' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3768)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hybrid High-Order Methods for Singular Situations</b><br />Liam Yemm<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-54.html'>Novel Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G107<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75280' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(482)' class='star'><span class='star482'>&star;</span></a> Tian Yu Yen  <span id='bitlink-3769'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3769)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3769' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3769)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Measuring Uncertainty in Data Fusion Algorithms</b><br />Tian Yu Yen<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-107.html'>Information Fusion for Computational Models and Inverse Problems - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>In recent years, the fields of optimization, uncertainty quantification and machine learning have all been gravitating towards developing algorithms and models that can enable the capacity to incorporate, or fuse, data from disparate sources or fidelities.

Various real-world science and engineering applications involve modeling complex systems based on insufficient data, where the resulting uncertain model may be used for subsequent tasks such as prediction or control. The ability to accurately estimate the impact of the uncertainty present in the current model on the expected performance of these tasks is crucial for optimal experimental design (OED), as it allows one to prioritize experiments that can effectively reduce the model uncertainty that practically matters. While the efficacy of MOCU-based OED has been demonstrated in several problems, the high computational cost for MOCU estimation has been a significant obstacle to its application. In this talk, we present machine learning (ML) strategies that can remarkably accelerate MOCU computation, thereby substantially scale-up MOCU-based OED capabilities.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75481' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(239)' class='star'><span class='star239'>&star;</span></a> Zohar Yosibash  <span id='bitlink-3772'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3772)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3772' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3772)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Autonomous Finite Elements in Clinical Practice - Coupling FEA with AI</b><br />Zohar Yosibash<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-53.html'>Computational Modeling of Coupled Multiscale Systems - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>Finite element analysis requires a qualified analyst to generate the necessary input data, verify the output and post-process the analysis results for a meaningful conclusion. The required expertise and labor efforts precluded the use of FEA in daily medical practice for example.     
Recent scientific advancements such as low-dose CT scans, machine  learning, and high order FEA which allows an inherent verification methodology of the numerical accuracy, make it possible to provide a fully autonomous process for assessing bone strength and fracture risk. This autonomous process, which we refer to as autonomous streamline, named autonomous finite element (AFE) analysis, introduces a paradigm shift in the use of FEA.      This talk addresses a novel AFE [Yosibash et al,  CMAME, 80(11), p 2417, 2020] for patient-specific analysis of human femurs used in clinical practice: it involves an automatic segmentation of femurs from CT-scans by U-Net, an automatic mesh generation and application of boundary conditions based on anatomical points, a high-order FE analysis with numerical error control, and an automatic report with a clear assessment of bone fracture risk. Two specific applications of AFE are presented:  a) Determination of the risk of fracture for patients with tumors of the femur [Sternheim et al,  Bone, 110, p215, 2018, &  BJJ, 102-B, p638, 2020].   b) Identifying patients with high hip fracture risk [Rotman et al,  BJJ, 103-B, p1497, 2021].    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75279' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1489)' class='star'><span class='star1489'>&star;</span></a> Yue Yu  <span id='bitlink-3773'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3773)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3773' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3773)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Physics-Guided Nonlocal Neural Operators</b><br />Yue Yu<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-327.html'>Nonlocal Models in Computational Science and Engineering</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Neural operators, which emerge as implicit solution operators of hidden governing equations, have recently become popular tools for learning responses of complex real-world physical systems. Nevertheless, the majority of neural operator applications has thus far been data-driven, which neglects the intrinsic preservation of fundamental physical laws in data. In this paper, we introduce a novel integral neural operator architecture, to learn physical models with fundamental conservation laws automatically guaranteed. In particular, by replacing the frame-dependent position information with its invariant counterpart in the kernel space, the proposed neural operator is by design translation- and rotation-invariant, and consequently abides by the conservation laws of linear and angular momentums. As applications, we demonstrate the expressivity and efficacy of our model in learning complex material behaviors from both synthetic and experimental datasets, and show that, by automatically satisfying these essential physical laws, our learned neural operator is not only generalizable in handling translated and rotated datasets, but also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency as compared to baseline neural operator models.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75730' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(566)' class='star'><span class='star566'>&star;</span></a> Yukun Yue  <span id='bitlink-3774'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3774)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3774' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3774)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On Convergence Analysis of a First-Order Semi-Discrete Numerical Scheme for a Hydrodynamic Q-Tensor Model for Liquid Crsytals</b><br />Yukun Yue<br />Wednesday, March 1 11:05 AM&ndash;11:20 AM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-124.html'>Exact Polynomialization and Quadratization of Nonlinear Dynamics - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>We present a convergence analysis of an unconditional energy-stable first-order semi-discrete numerical scheme designed for the hydrodynamic Q-tensor model based on the Invariant Quadratization Method(IEQ).

The invariant Quadratization Method enables us to construct a linear scheme for the systems, accelerating the computation speed. However, it introduces an auxiliary variable into the systems to replace the bulk potential energy. A typical problem is whether this new variable coincides with the original energy. In this work, we prove the stability properties of the scheme and show its convergence to a weak solution of the coupled liquid crystal system. In the weak sense, we have also demonstrated the equivalence of the solution for the reformulated and original systems.

Classically, the former focuses on achieving high productivity, while the latter focuses on extracting peak performance on a given system. Given that both the complexity of programming novel architectures increases, and that the trend of producing heterogeneous systems that combine multiple such complex architectures is becoming normal, humble programming that achieves scalable performance close to peak on a variety of architectures is becoming a necessity-- yet remains challenging.  This talk introduces the free and open-source Algebraic Programming (ALP) paradigm as such a candidate solution, and ALP/GraphBLAS specifically. Here, programmers must annotate their code with algebraic information, which the compiler then exploits in optimization, the detection of programmer errors, and unscalable behaviour. Beyond sparse linear algebra, we additionally extend ALP to cover dense linear algebra as well as vertex-centric programming. Finally, we demonstrate the ALP platform's efficiency and scalability, thus arriving at a humble programming model for both numerical linear algebra, graph algorithms, and beyond.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75882' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(554)' class='star'><span class='star554'>&star;</span></a> Matthew J.

The linear space is constructed using the method of snapshots and POD; prior to compression, each snapshot is composed with a mapping that causes its local features to align (same spatial location) with the corresponding features in all other snapshots. The parametrized domain mapping is chosen such that the local features present in the linear space deform to the corresponding features in the solution being approximated, effectively removing the convection-dominated nature of the problem. The domain mapping is determined implicitly through the solution of a residual minimization problem, rather than relying on explicit sensing/detection.  We provide several numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectivity of the proposed method for high-speed aerodynamic flows.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75409' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1475)' class='star'><span class='star1475'>&star;</span></a> Stefano Zampini  <span id='bitlink-3777'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3777)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3777' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3777)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Device Accelerated Second-Order Solvers for Machine Learning Training with Petsc</b><br />Stefano Zampini<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:15 PM&ndash;2:30 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-325.html'>On the Mutual Benefit of  Machine Learning and Domain Decomposition/Multilevel Methods - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D403<br /><br /><small>Deep learning and neural networks have had a tremendous impact in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Such a widely recognized success has recently driven developments and applications of similar techniques in the context of computational science and engineering, for example as functional representation of the solution of partial differential equations, or when learning parameters to observable maps.    
CSE differs from the traditional contexts in which these machine learning techniques operate, due to a possibly richer training dataset available. Building on this observation, and in the quest of constructing higher-fidelity representations of the physical models to be represented, in this talk we will present preliminary results using second-order methods as implemented in PETSc to train some of the models that have been recently proposed in the literature, with applications coming from function interpolation, partial differential equations, Bayesian frameworks, and molecular dynamics.

One of the major challenges of coupled problems is to manage non-conforming meshes at the interface between two models and/or domains, due to different numerical schemes or domains discretizations employed. Moreover, very often complex submodels depend on (e.g., physical or geometrical) parameters. Knowing how outputs of interest are affected by parameter variations is key to gain useful insights of the described physics.    
In this talk we propose a parametric reduced order modeling (ROM) technique based on Reduced Basis methods, to fully reduce multi-scale and multi-  physics problems featuring interface non-conformity. We combine Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and discretized empirical interpolation method (DEIM) to represent each sub-problem solution, whereas Dirichlet and Neumann parameter dependent interface conditions are reconstructed and interpolated across non-conforming interfaces by means of DEIM.    
The proposed method can be regarded as an efficient alternative to numerical schemes such as domain-decomposition methods, reducing the costs of multi-query simulations.    
Numerical results on the coupled heart-torso model, a multi-physics model  arising in cardiac electrophysiology to simulate relevant clinical outputs (e.g. the ECG), show the feasibility of the proposed strategy in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75833' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(123)' class='star'><span class='star123'>&star;</span></a> Mikhail Zaslavsky  <span id='bitlink-3780'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3780)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3780' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3780)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Distance Preserving Model Order Reduction of Graph-Laplacians for Cluster Analysis</b><br />Mikhail Zaslavsky<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-27.html'>Reduced Order Models for Applications in Graphs and Inverse Problems - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>Graph-Laplacians play an important role in multiple areas of machine learning directly related to imaging, such as image segmentation and, in general, discovering the structure of large data sets that may not have explicit geometric interpretation. Spectral imbedding of graph-Laplacians provides a low-dimensional parametrization of the data manifold which makes the subsequent task (for example, clustering, with k-means or any of its approximations) much easier. However, despite reducing data dimensionality, the overall computational cost may still be prohibitive for accurate clustering of large data sets.    
In this talk we present a novel multi-level divide-and-conquer approach for clustering of big data sets. At each level, independent clustering tasks are performed for small data subsets. Unlike conventional greedy graph coarsening algorithms, the crucial part of our approach is efficient clustering of each of these subsets (target subsets) that ensures the consistency of subset clustering with the clustering of the full data set (if one would perform such). To achieve this goal we construct a low-dimensional representation of the original graph that respects important distances between the vertices of the target subset. Our main tool is the so-called reduced-order graph Laplacian that approximates these distances with spectral accuracy. Numerical results will be provided to illustrate the performance of the approach.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75238' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1992)' class='star'><span class='star1992'>&star;</span></a> Gentian Zavalani  <span id='bitlink-3781'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3781)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3781' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3781)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High-Order Numerical Integration for Closed Surfaces</b><br />Gentian Zavalani<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-411.html'>High-Order Methods for PDEs</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>We propose a novel high-order integration method for surface integrals. The approach rests on curved triangulations, approximating a vast class of regular (smooth) surfaces. The novelty of our contribution is given by accurate interpolation of the closest point projection $\pi :\mathcal{M}_{h}\longrightarrow \mathcal{M}\subset R^{3}$, realising the curved triangles. To do so, we incorporate recent advances in multivariate   interpolation, suppressing Runge's phenomenon when interpolating $\pi$ in proper chosen, transformed Chebyshev-Lobatto nodes. The specific transformation we propose here, yield the integration scheme to be   largely independent of the mesh quality and maintains stability for high orders.    
Further, we combine our technique with the novel global polynomial level set parametrisation method (GPLS). GPLS only requires regular samples $P \subseteq \mathcal{M}$ of the surface $\mathcal{M}$ in order to derive implicit global models of the surface  $\mathcal{M}= Q_{\mathcal{M}}^{-1}(0)$. This allows us to apply our high-order integration scheme to a vast class of non-parameterised  surfaces by deriving the closest point map from the global polynomial level set $Q_{\mathcal{M}}$. As our empirical demonstrations suggest, we expect the approach to be applicable for a broad class of computational tasks in numerical differential geometry arising for "real world" problems across disciplines, e.g., bio-physics, material sciences and computer graphics.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77157' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(529)' class='star'><span class='star529'>&star;</span></a> Kamila Zdybal  <span id='bitlink-3782'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3782)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3782' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3782)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Reduced-Order Modeling with a Regression-Aware Autoencoder</b><br />Kamila Zdybal<br />Monday, February 27 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-115.html'>Reduced-Complexity Models for Fluid Flows - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>The first step in reduced-order modeling (ROM) workflows is finding a low-dimensional representation of a highly-dimensional system. The second step of ROM often requires training a nonlinear regression model to predict physical quantities of interest from the reduced representation. Much of the research on training ROMs thus far has tackled those two steps separately. While they both come with their challenges, a good-quality low-dimensional system representation usually facilitates building a regression model. In this work, we leverage the link between dimensionality reduction and nonlinear regression. We propose an approach where dimensionality reduction and nonlinear regression are considered jointly within an autoencoder-like neural-network architecture. The dimensionality reduction (encoding) is affected by forcing accurate regression (decoding) of the quantities of interest. We show that such a joint architecture leads to improved low-dimensional representations as the two steps communicate with each other through backpropagation. We apply our regression-aware autoencoder on test cases coming from reacting and non-reacting flow systems. The relevant quantities of interest are the important state variables and highly nonlinear source terms required by the reduced model. The proposed approach can serve as an effective replacement of standalone dimensionality-reduction techniques whenever nonlinear regression is anticipated in the downstream use.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75391' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(201)' class='star'><span class='star201'>&star;</span></a> Jakob Zech  <span id='bitlink-3783'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3783)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3783' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3783)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Expression Rate Bounds for Neural and GPC Operator Surrogates</b><br />Jakob Zech<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-44.html'>Operator Learning in the Physical and Data Sciences - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>Approximation rates are analyzed for deep surrogates of maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces, which arise e.g. as data-to-solution maps for linear and nonlinear partial differential equations.

However, existing domain decomposition methods for parametric PDEs are usually intrusive, which means domain decomposition based solvers need to be implemented from scratch for each target parametric PDE. To address this issue, we develop a new non-intrusive domain-decomposition model reduction method for linear steady-state PDEs with random-field coefficients. As a variant of our previous work by Mu and Zhang, the new method only needs access to the final linear system, that is, the global stiffness matrix and the right hand side, of a deterministic PDE solver, in order to build a domain-decomposition-based reduced model without intrusive implementation from scratch. The key idea is to remove the interface condition between sub-domains and rely on the correlation between columns of the linear system to couple the sub-domains. The non-intrusive feature enables the applicability of the proposed method to a broader class of uncertainty quantification problems, where many legacy codes/solvers can be fully reused by our method. Two numerical examples including diffusion equations with random diffusivity and convection-dominated transport with random velocity, are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75886' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(369)' class='star'><span class='star369'>&star;</span></a> Hong Zhang  <span id='bitlink-3786'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3786)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3786' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3786)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Sann: Stiffness-Aware Neural Network for Learning Hamiltonian Systems</b><br />Hong Zhang<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-82.html'>Optimization, Design, and Machine Learning in the FASTMath SciDAC-5 Institute - Part II of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>In this talk, I will present stiffness-aware neural network (SANN), a new method for learning Hamiltonian dynamical systems from data.

This classification along with a resampling technique allows one to apply different time integration strategies such as step size adaptation to better capture the dynamical characteristics of the Hamiltonian vector fields. SANN has been evaluated using complex physical systems including a three-body problem and billiard model. The results show that SANN is more stable and can better preserve energy when compared with the state-of-the-art methods, leading to significant improvement in accuracy.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75340' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1964)' class='star'><span class='star1964'>&star;</span></a> Hongmin Zhang  <span id='bitlink-3787'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3787)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3787' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3787)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Droplets Evaporation on Chemically Patterned Surfaces</b><br />Hongmin Zhang<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1506)' class='star'><span class='star1506'>&star;</span></a> Lingqi Zhang  <span id='bitlink-3788'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3788)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3788' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3788)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Revisiting Stencil Optimizations as the Architecture Gap Between GPUs and CPUs Shrinks</b><br />Lingqi Zhang<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-332.html'>Stencil Computation for Scientific Applications - Part II of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D408<br /><br /><small>GPUs being traditionally throughput-optimized while CPUs being latency-optimized has been reflected in how stencils are optimized for each architecture. In particular, temporal blocking has been more geared towards CPUs due to the latency penalty of deep temporal blocking on GPUs. On the other hand embarrassingly parallel partial accumulation optimizations have been more suitable for GPUs. The latency of all operations across the spectrum on GPUs drop, while HPC-grade CPUs (ex: A64FX) become equipped with high bandwidth memory and wide vectors. As a results, in some aspects, the gap between GPUs and CPUs is shrinking. In this talk we first describe how GPUs have evolved in the last decade in a way that can make them more accommodating of stencil optimizations that favor low-latency architectures. We also describe the reverse effect: how some HPC-grade CPUs are more accommodating of stencil optimization that favor high-throughput architectures.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75737' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1957)' class='star'><span class='star1957'>&star;</span></a> Liu Zhang  <span id='bitlink-3789'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3789)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3789' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3789)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Topology-Based Comparison of Population Activities in Neural Networks</b><br />Liu Zhang<br />Tuesday, February 28 4:00 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (poster session)<br />Europa Foyer<br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=76526' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1253)' class='star'><span class='star1253'>&star;</span></a> Lu Zhang  <span id='bitlink-3790'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3790)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3790' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3790)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>MetaNO: A Meta-Learnt Nonlocal Neural Operator Approach for Efficient Material Modeling</b><br />Lu Zhang<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-275.html'>Machine Learning for Large-Scale Scientific Data Analysis and Model Simulations - Part I of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>In real-world material modeling problems, the data acquisition is often very challenging and expensive, which makes learning the material model with a limited number of measurements critical. Herein, we propose a meta-learnt approach for transfer-learning between neural operators, Meta-NO, based on the implicit Fourier neural operator (IFNO) approach. The overall goal is to efficiently provide accurate solution surrogates for new and unknown material-learning tasks (e.g., with different microstructure or mechanical parameters), from multiple training tasks where each task corresponds to different materials. The proposed sample-efficient meta-learning algorithm consists of two phases: (1) learning a common representation by sharing the same iterative integral layers from existing tasks; and (2) transferring the learned knowledge and rapidly learning surrogate operators for new and unseen tasks with a different material, where only a few test samples are required. The result demonstrates that the meta-learnt representation would handle complex and nonlinear material response learning tasks, while greatly improving the sampling efficiency in new and unseen microstructures. Hence, it would substantially reduce the cost on lab testing for new materials.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75623' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(51)' class='star'><span class='star51'>&star;</span></a> Nan Zhang  <span id='bitlink-3791'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3791)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3791' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3791)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Well-Conditioned Mode Matching Method for Applications in Photonics</b><br />Nan Zhang<br />Wednesday, March 1 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-11.html'>Computational Methods for Kinetic Models - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D301<br /><br /><small>To analyze photonics devices such as optical waveguides, resonant cavities and diffraction gratings, it is necessary to solve the Maxwell’s equations numerically. Due to the complexity of the structure, conventional numerical methods, such as the finite difference and finite element methods, are not very efficient. Often, a photonic device consists of several simpler parts for which the dielectric function depends only on one spatial variable. The mode matching method and its many numerical variants have been widely used to analyze photonic devices with simple one-dimensional parts. Since the dielectric function is typically piecewise constant, numerical mode matching methods based on piecewise polynomials, such as the polynomial expansion mode matching method (PEMM) and the pseudo-spectral mode matching method (PSMM), are particularly efficient. However, the condition numbers associated with PEMM and PSMM are often very large, leading to limited accuracy and difficulty in convergence when iterative methods are used. In this paper, we develop a well-conditioned numerical mode matching method based on a spectral Galerkin scheme. We show that this method produces numerical modes with good orthogonality and significantly reduces the condition numbers of the final linear systems.

The varying contact conditions at the large frictional contact area, which can highly depend on the pretension, inevitably change the properties of joints. Consequently, the dynamic behavior of the system is influenced and it is desirable to predict and assess these influences from a design point of view. However, commonly used finite element models can result in large sizes for complex systems while the contact mechanism requires complicated time-domain iterative solvers, making the computation time-consuming. Therefore, a parametric model order reduction strategy is proposed for the efficient simulation of bolted structures with changes in pretension. This strategy uses a Craig-Bampton rationale, in which the second-order Krylov subspace is applied for reduction and parameterization for pretension. Due to the large dimension of contact surfaces, the contact surface reduction is applied based on the combination of characteristic constraint modes and joint interface modes. To compute the time-domain dynamics of the reduced model, the dual loop contact algorithm for the augmented Lagrange multiplier method in conjunction with Newmark method is employed. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed reduction method is illustrated by the time domain displacements and detailed contact conditions of a proof-of-concept bolted structure under different pretensions.

We theoretically proved that SympNets are universal approximators within the class of symplectic maps. We apply SympNet to learn the evolution map from the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results across multiple steps, which reduces the computational cost of traditional MD solver by 20% on GPU while being able to keeping energy constant in the NVE ensemble. We apply SympNet to solve the high dimensional path planning problems. We experimentally showed that our neural-network-based method SympNets can overcome the curse of dimensionality by solving the path planning problem of 256 closely interacted drones in 1.5 hours.    
As a generalization of SympNet, we proposed the GENERIC formalism informed neural network (GFINN), which exactly satisfies the first and second law of thermodynamics, to facilitate prediction of the evolution of complex processes that are dissipative in nature.

In CCS, the captured anthropogenic CO$_2$ is injected into the geological media such as depleted reservoirs and deep saline aquifers for long-term sequestration. Numerical simulation is an essential tool for managing the subsurface flow, but suffers prohibitively high computational cost due to the nonlinearity of the multi-physics nature. Surrogate models, constructing approximations with greater efficiency for computational expensive numerical models, provide alternative approaches to predict the CO$_2$ sequestration process. A deep-learning-based surrogate model is developed in this work for predicting the temporal-spatial evolution of CO$_2$ plume migration in heterogeneous geological formations with high computational efficiency. The surrogate model is trained to predict the CO$_2$ saturation and solution CO$_2$-brine ratio in the saline aquifer, which are two secure parameters to calculate the amount of CO$_2$ trapped by dissolution. The deep learning workflow not only provides high predictive fidelity across temporal and spatial scales, but also offers a speedup of 5 orders of magnitude compared to traditional numerical simulation, and thus will be a significant predictive tool for engineers to manage the long-term process of CCS.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75393' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(39)' class='star'><span class='star39'>&star;</span></a> Shifan Zhao  <span id='bitlink-3795'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3795)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3795' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3795)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Solving Minimax Optimization via Anderson Mixing</b><br />Shifan Zhao<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-9.html'>Anderson Acceleration and Its Recent Developments</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75195' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1173)' class='star'><span class='star1173'>&star;</span></a> Xingbo Zhao  <span id='bitlink-3796'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3796)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3796' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3796)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Nucleon Structure from a Light-Front Hamiltonian Approach</b><br />Xingbo Zhao<br />Monday, February 27 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-257.html'>High-Performance Algorithms for Large Scale Eigenvalue Problems in Physical Simulations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E102<br /><br /><small>Nucleon structure encodes key information on the strong interaction, one of the four fundamental interactions in nature. Understanding the structure of the nucleon in terms of the quantum many-body problem of its constituents is at the frontier of particle and nuclear physics. Light-front quantum field theory provides a viable framework for accessing nucleon structure through large scale eigenvalue problems of the Hamiltonian of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of the strong interaction. In this talk, I will introduce our parallel application named BLFQ (Basis Light-front Quantization) through which the nucleon structure problem is formulated as a large sparse symmetric eigenvalue problem of the QCD Hamiltonian. I will discuss the computational challenges in constructing and solving the eigenvalue problem of the QCD Hamiltonian as well as the features from the QCD Hamiltonian which can be exploited to boost the numerical efficiency.

Introducing sparsity in these deep models by enforcing most entries in their weight matrices to zero can reduce their complexity. However, learning such sparse networks is difficult. Motivated by recent works showing the expressivity of the butterfly structure for neural network design, a promising approach is to promote sparsity during training by approximating any dense weight matrices with a product of sparse butterfly factors. Our main contribution is to show that any butterfly factorization $\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{X}^{(1)} \ldots \mathbf{X}^{(J)}$ where the factors $\mathbf{X}^{(\ell)}$ of size $N \times N$ follow the butterfly constraint is essentially unique, and we provide an efficient hierarchical algorithm that can recover these factors up to unavoidable scaling ambiguities from the product $\mathbf{Z}$. Our method consists in recursively factorizing the considered matrix into two factors, by relying on a non-trivial application of the singular value decomposition to compute best rank-one approximations of specific submatrices, instead of iterative gradient descent steps. The complexity of our algorithm is only of $O(N^2)$, and it enables fast $O(N \log N)$ matrix-vector multiplication. Hence our work provides a first step toward the construction of an efficient proximal operator associated to the butterfly structure for sparse neural network training.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75326' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1847)' class='star'><span class='star1847'>&star;</span></a> Huan Zhou  <span id='bitlink-3798'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3798)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3798' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3798)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Study of Spatial-/Time-Varying Parameter Estimation Using Genetic Algorithm and Overlapping Sliding Window Approach</b><br />Huan Zhou<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-407.html'>HPC Applications for Tackling Global and Engineering Challenges Towards Exascale</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D504<br /><br /><small>The models created for real-life problems in the area of water resources and epidemiology often account for spatial-/time-varying input parameters to dynamically reflect variations depending on miscellaneous factors – seasonal change, human interventions, location, etc. Such variations make fast and efficient calibration a challenge, reflected in two aspects: segmentation and optimization algorithm. The Overlapping Sliding Window (OSW) technique is often used to segment a massive (calibration) problem into smaller sub-problems over different time slices. The segmented calibration problems are then solved individually using an optimization algorithm. Searching for the optimal values of such parameters over a time slice can even be complicated by the dimensionality of the space due to spatial variability. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proven to remain a powerful tool for optimizing parameters when the search space is large. Thus, this study proposes a calibration approach that combines the OSW and a hybrid MPI+OpenMP version of GA to progressively refine and determine the near-optimal trajectory of spatial-/time-varying parameters. The efficiency of the proposed calibration method is evaluated by an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model featuring a region-/weekly-varying transmission rate. Results indicated that our approach leads to satisfactory calibration accuracy with a low root-mean-square error (RMSE) and achieves a considerable reduction in the computational cost over the serial counterpart on the HPC cluster    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75888' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span><br /><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1154)' class='star'><span class='star1154'>&star;</span></a> Mo Zhou  <span id='bitlink-3799'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(3799)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-3799' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(3799)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Learning for the Inverse Obstacle Scattering Problem</b><br />Mo Zhou<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-253.html'>Fast Methods for Integral Equations and Their Applications in Forward and Inverse Problems - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D407<br /><br /><small>The inverse scattering problem has many applications such as sonar and CT.

Oftentimes, GPs with derivative information can be useful in many settings where derivative information is available, including numerous Bayesian optimization and regression tasks that arise in the natural sciences. Given the $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost in computation for $n$ training points for GPs, stochastic variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) scale GP inference to large datasets through inducing points and stochastic training. However, the SVGP training process involves hard multimodal optimization, and often suffers from slow and suboptimal convergence when initializing inducing points directly from training data. Moreover, SVGP scales poorly with the number of dimensions when derivative information is incorporated. We split this presentation into two parts to focus on the two issues. In the first part, we discuss an efficient initialization of SVGP to make the training more efficient and in the second part we discuss a fully scalable SVGP method with derivatives, the training cost of which is independent of both the number of training data and the number of input dimensions.

The transfer of discrete fields, such as stresses, pressure, displacements, or velocities, might be required both along surfaces or within volumes.  Variational transfer techniques might also play an important role at the level of the discretization, e.g., within non-conforming domain decomposition or mortar methods for the transfer along surfaces, or on the level of the solution method, e.g., within multigrid or multi-level methods for the transfer between different volume meshes.

Recently, motivated by the limitations of classical approaches such as the Reduced Basis method, many authors have been considering the use of neural networks and Deep Learning techniques for building non-intrusive ROMs.  We tackle the development of a constructive approach based on deep neural networks for the efficient approximation of the parameter-to-solution map of PDEs. Our work is based on the use of deep autoencoders, which we employ for encoding and decoding a high-fidelity approximation of the solution manifold. We study the expressivity of these deep neural networks with respect to the solution manifold and we present some results that illustrate the connection between the expressivity and the complexity of the networks. Furthermore, we discuss its generalization to PDEs involving complex domains, leveraging on the idea of sparsifying the network architecture by means of information about the topology of the computational mesh used for the full order model.   Finally, we present how these methodologies are applied to sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification of mathematical models for porous media such as Darcy flow in domains with fractures or channels.

It has kept our lights on for over a century, but is currently facing immense transformations. To combat climate change, countries increasingly rely on renewable energy generated by solar and wind, but these sources of energy are not always available. How do we keep the lights on in an affordable way, and how do we manage the increasing risk of blackouts?  To facilitate this transition, the electricity network needs a radical transformation to deal with increased levels of usage, variability, and decentralization. Indeed, the future smart grid will look dramatically different from the current electricity network, just like today’s internet looks nothing like the 20th-century telephone network.  In addition to the many technical, economic, regulatory, and societal challenges, the design and analysis of the future smart grid requires the development of novel mathematical foundations. This talk will discuss some of the challenges that arise across the entire spectrum of mathematics, including geometry, optimization, dynamical systems, and probability.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77243' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span>

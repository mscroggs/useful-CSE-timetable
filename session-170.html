<h2>A Roadmap to Robust Science for High-throughput Applications: Use Cases and Lessons Learned</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk777' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(777)' class='star'><span class='star777'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Ewa Deelman, Robust Science Roadmap: Challenges in Software Systems and High Throughput Computing Applications <span id='bitlink-722'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(722)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-722' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(722)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Robust Science Roadmap: Challenges in Software Systems and High Throughput Computing Applications</b><br />Ewa Deelman<br />Monday, February 27 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-170.html'>A Roadmap to Robust Science for High-throughput Applications: Use Cases and Lessons Learned</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>While trust in and reproducibility of scientific artifacts are generally application-dependent and require correctness, numerical, and sensibility evaluations, the performance reproducibility is more architecture- and runtime-dependent (i.e., heterogeneous architectures and systems causing deadlocks, non-deterministic MPI runtime, unpredictable behaviors due to the increasingly complex software stacks).  Moreover, systems have been increasing in complexity over the past two decades. Accelerators, SoCs, and other configurations are exponentially increasing the diversity of hardware resources. In this talk we will discuss how all these system architecture features should be leveraged to facilitate robust science by moving in new research directions. Specifically, we will outline how system architecture is not an isolated area but must be considered in conjunction with system software; hardware and system software configurations can be voluminous and very detailed in terms of organization; and documenting hardware and system software configurations can also exhibit inconsistencies. We will also present (a) case studies in which, at the execution phase, computation and frequent nondeterminism are not easy to measure, verify, or reproduce, and (b) tentative solutions to these case studies that require engaging the system architecture and system software properties (e.g., by establishing consistent metrics and methods).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75469' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk778' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(778)' class='star'><span class='star778'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Ivona Brandic, Edge Computing as a Missing Link in the Post Moore Era <span id='bitlink-723'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(723)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-723' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(723)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Edge Computing as a Missing Link in the Post Moore Era</b><br />Ivona Brandic<br />Monday, February 27 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-170.html'>A Roadmap to Robust Science for High-throughput Applications: Use Cases and Lessons Learned</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>In the first part of this talk we discuss the concept of extreme performance HPC where the applications often include latencies below 100 ms or even below 10 ms. To facilitate low latency computation has to be placed in the vicinity of the end users by utilizing the concept of Edge Computing. We present the novel failure resilience mechanisms applied to Edge systems considering timeliness, hyper-heterogeneity and resource scarcity. We discuss our machine learning based mechanism that evaluates the failure resilience of a service deployed redundantly on the Edge infrastructures. Our approach learns the spatiotemporal dependencies between Edge server failures and combines them with the topological information to incorporate link failures by utilizing the concept of the Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs).     
In the second part we discuss the potential impact of Edge Computing in the current rise of highly specialized architectures ranging from neuromorphic to quantum computing. As we experience the paradigm shift from generalized architectures of the Von Neumann era to highly specialized architectures in the Post-Mooreâ€™s law era we expect the coexistence of multiple types of architectures specialized for different types of computation. We define the two of the architectures that attracted the most interest in the research community, where we witness not only theoretical developments but also first implementations and practical use cases.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75469' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk779' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(779)' class='star'><span class='star779'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (Emerald Room)</b> Maciej Malawski, High-throughput Applications in Computational Medicine <span id='bitlink-724'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(724)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-724' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(724)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High-throughput Applications in Computational Medicine</b><br />Maciej Malawski<br />Monday, February 27 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-170.html'>A Roadmap to Robust Science for High-throughput Applications: Use Cases and Lessons Learned</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />Emerald Room<br /><br /><small>Computational medicine combines recent advances in computing, to build predictive models for diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and combines computer simulations with artificial intelligence. While these complementary approaches typically require different computing technologies (traditional HPC vs GPU computing for machine learning), both of them often need an additional level of high-throughput computing (HTC) to achieve meaningful results.    
In the case of modeling and simulation approaches, an important step in development of models which can be translated into clinical practice, is the verification, validation and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ). This process requires running the model with a large number of parameters, which calls for high-throughput computing. In the case of AI-based models, the typical HTC workload results from hyperparameter optimization in machine learning, architecture search in deep neural networks, or large-scale studies in federated learning. Finally, the models in computational medicine can be used to run large studies called in-silico trials, which aim to experiment with various models and treatment strategies on a set of real or virtual patients. Examples of the tools which support such studies on HPC and cloud environments are the Model Execution Environment or CloudVVUQ library.

Many of these requires highest performance from todayâ€™s supercomputers, which are demanding corresponding high levels of energy and thus affect our environment. As a consequence, we need to balance the needs and costs for environmental computing, such that more computing is available at lower energy consumptions. This leads to innovative approaches in energy-efficient computing with heterogeneous architectures. The talk provides use cases on environmental research and showcases some of the ideas pursued at Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) for energy reduction, such as hot-water cooling and waste heat usage, applied to high throughput applications.

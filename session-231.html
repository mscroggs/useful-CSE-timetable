In such process, the folding flaps of the polylaminated package are heated through a hot air jet, and then pressed together to obtain a watertight welding. A satisfactory sealing is obtained when the local polylaminated material temperatures are in the correct window at the moment when folding flaps are pressed one against each other.  Simulations of the temperature field evolution within the layers of the package based on the solution of the Fourier equation, have been carried out to analyze how much the process is dependent on parameters such as the package dimension and layers materials properties, the heating air temperature and speed, and the heating time.  In the framework of the full order model, the heat exchange govern equation is discretized making use of the Finite Element Method, implemented in a C++ software. A reduced order model has also been developed to allow for faster computations, compatible with real time control algorithms wired in the packaging machinery. Based on POD modal decomposition, both a non intrusive model based on the interpolation of the proper orthogonal decomposition modes, and a POD-Galerkin intrusive solver have been developed. The results obtained with the reduced order models will be presented and compared to characterize their performance.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75553' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1055' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1055)' class='star'><span class='star1055'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (D502)</b> Ludger Paehler, Automated Acceleration of Differentiable Computational Fluid Dynamics for Bayesian Optimization <span id='bitlink-971'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(971)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-971' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(971)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Automated Acceleration of Differentiable Computational Fluid Dynamics for Bayesian Optimization</b><br />Ludger Paehler<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-231.html'>Accelerating Computational Science and Engineering via Data-Driven Learning and Nonlinear Model Reduction - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>With the ever more prevalent use of differentiable programming techniques throughout simulations, and machine learning, the desire to extend these techniques to classical fluid dynamics simulations for outer-loop applications such as Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification, and Bayesian Optimization has also become ever more pressing. While current approaches in fluid dynamics still view simulation as a black box which is then integrated with an outer-loop optimization framework, and potentially utilizes Gaussian Process surrogates to accelerate the sampling, modern differentiable programming approaches promise to heavily accelerate the optimization process through the acceleration of simulations, and the access to gradients of simulation trajectories.    
In this talk we build on recent advances in compiler-based automatic differentiation of parallelized C/C++, and  Fortran-based computational fluid dynamics simulators to for the first time accelerate the production-level simulations with machine learning techniques in an intrusive fashion to enable Bayesian optimization, where it was previously infeasible to apply Bayesian optimization to.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75553' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1056' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1056)' class='star'><span class='star1056'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (D502)</b> Nicola Demo, Real-Time Modeling Through Neural Networks: Challenges and Perspectives <span id='bitlink-972'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(972)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-972' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(972)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Real-Time Modeling Through Neural Networks: Challenges and Perspectives</b><br />Nicola Demo<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-231.html'>Accelerating Computational Science and Engineering via Data-Driven Learning and Nonlinear Model Reduction - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>in the last years, the exponential diffusion of machine learning algorithms has contributed to improve already consolidated procedure, as well as allowing the creation of new frameworks, also in the field of data-driven and reduced order modeling. In particular, the neural networks, thanks to their approximation capability, have enabled the treatment of complex nonlinear models, maintaining a very limited computational cost during the inference of these models.  In this contribution, we present some of the enhancements obtained by employing neural networks to overcome the limitations of standard technique like 1) an automatic snapshots shifting to solve the weakness of proper orthogonal decomposition in advection-dominated problems, 2) a multi-fidelity approach to improve the accuracy of a generic data-driven reduced order model and 3) the development of continuous convolutional filter to reduce the  dimensionality with unstructured data.  Numerical experiments are finally shown, with a particular focus about the comparison with state-of-the-art methods, to conclude then with the open challenges raised by the proposed techniques.

However, calculation of derivative becomes impractical for computational expensive problems. We propose to build a multi-fidelity surrogate model using Gaussian Process and then use the derivative from the surrogate to generate proposals for NUTS. The multi-fidelity surrogate is built upon a hierarchy of models of decreasing approximation error and increasing computational cost where we delegate the majority of computational cost to the lower fidelity models. The samples are accepted/rejected according to the delayed acceptance criterion to ensure the detailed balance with respect to highest fidelity model. Then we test our problem on some  test cases and compare it to existing methods.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75553' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

Similar to the existing adaptive low-rank method for elliptic problems, the method is based on a perturbed Richardson iteration, in the present case applied to a standard space-time variational formulation of the parabolic initial-boundary value problem. The analysis of the method requires a new approximation class for the temporal operator, taking into account the interaction between hierarchical tensor formats of different time indices. Since the parabolic operator is an isomorphism with respect to spaces not endowed with a cross norm, we devise a new low-rank preconditioning scheme based on exponential sum approximations that is adapted to the parabolic case. The method is shown to converge and satisfy similar complexity bounds as the existing adaptive low-rank methods for elliptic problems, establishing its suitability for parabolic problems on high-dimensional spatial domains and does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The construction also yields computable rigorous a posteriori error bounds for the total error depending on the activated basis functions and ranks in the approximation.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75372' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk456' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(456)' class='star'><span class='star456'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (D404)</b> Federico Vismara, Structure Preserving Hyper-Reduction of Parametric Hamiltonian Systems <span id='bitlink-421'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(421)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-421' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(421)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Structure Preserving Hyper-Reduction of Parametric Hamiltonian Systems</b><br />Federico Vismara<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-101.html'>High-Dimensional Approximation and Reduced-Order Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Many conservative processes in a wide range of physical and engineering applications can be modelled by Hamiltonian systems. The dynamics of such systems is described by the gradient of a scalar function, the Hamiltonian, which is preserved over time. Since the number of degrees of freedom required to provide accurate numerical solutions can be very large, model order reduction and hyper-reduction methods are typically used to achieve computational speedups, in particular in many-query simulations. However, traditional hyper-reduction techniques, such as discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM), fail to preserve the gradient structure of the flow velocity, which might lead to unphysical and unstable solutions. Furthermore, conservative phenomena do not exhibit global reducibility properties, in the sense that large approximation spaces are usually needed to accurately approximate the full order solution. To overcome these issues, we construct adaptive hyper-reduced models that retain the gradient structure and whose complexity is independent of the dimension of the full order problem. Finally, in order to exploit the local low-rank nature of conservative phenomena, both the reduced space and the DEIM basis are updated in time. In this talk, we will discuss this adaptive approach and present several numerical results.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75372' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk458' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(458)' class='star'><span class='star458'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (D404)</b> Gianluca Ceruti, Rank-Adaptive Time Integration of Tree Tensor Networks <span id='bitlink-422'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(422)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-422' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(422)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Rank-Adaptive Time Integration of Tree Tensor Networks</b><br />Gianluca Ceruti<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-101.html'>High-Dimensional Approximation and Reduced-Order Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>The numerical approximation of time dependent high dimensional problems is a challenging task: The storage required by the numerical approximation of the solution often exceeds standard memory resources. In this setting, time-dependent model order reduction and low-rank approximation techniques are of interest. In the present contribution, dynamical low-rank approximation for matrices together with recent developments on the topic of rank-adaptivity is briefly recapitulated. Then, appropriate notations and definitions for hierarchical tensors in Tucker format - also known as Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs) - are presented, and a robust rank-adaptive numerical integrator for the dynamical low-rank approximation of TTNs is introduced. The proposed algorithm recursively moves from the leaves to the root, updating the bases and the connection tensors via a Galerkin projection in an augmented subspace followed by a rank truncation up to a given error tolerance. It is shown that the memory requirements are linear in the order of the tensor and linear in the maximal mode dimension. Furthermore, the integrator inherits from the matrix setting property of interests such as robustness to small singular values of matricizations of the connection tensors. Up to the rank truncation error, the proposed integrator preserves norm and energy for Schroedinger equations, and it dissipates the energy in gradient systems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75372' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk2053' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2053)' class='star'><span class='star2053'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D404)</b> Maria Fuente Ruiz, SoTT: Adaptive Approximation of Tensors as Sum of Tensor Trains <span id='bitlink-1878'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1878)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1878' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1878)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>SoTT: Adaptive Approximation of Tensors as Sum of Tensor Trains</b><br />Maria Fuente Ruiz<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-101.html'>High-Dimensional Approximation and Reduced-Order Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small> </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75372' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

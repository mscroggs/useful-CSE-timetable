Simulation-based optimization methodologies have been proven tremendously powerful to support these processes for applications across all engineering domains. Nevertheless, the computational cost associated with search and assessment of the best final choice can be very high and, in turn, limit the use of these methods when problem complexity increases. With focus on the general case of black-box optimization, this talk will discuss methods to actively learn from diverse model ensembles to inform the decision processes. Different computational strategies will be considered ranging from established frameworks for multifidelity Bayesian optimization to novel original formulations targeting more efficient use of both the available models and the computational resources. Methods will be demonstrated over a set of established analytical benchmarks; applications to engineering design problems will also be presented to provide discussion elements for the adoption of these methods to address real-world optimization challenges.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75247' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk139' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(139)' class='star'><span class='star139'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM (E105)</b> Frederick Law, Boosting Variance Reduction with Meta Multifidelity Estimators <span id='bitlink-131'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(131)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-131' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(131)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Boosting Variance Reduction with Meta Multifidelity Estimators</b><br />Frederick Law<br />Friday, March 3 9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-31.html'>Multi-Fidelity Methods for Uncertainty Quantification and Optimization - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>This work introduces meta estimators that combine multiple multi-fidelity techniques based on control variates, importance sampling, and information reuse, to yield a quasi-multiplicative amount of variance reduction. The proposed meta estimators are particularly efficient within outer-loop applications, such as reliability-based design and shape optimization, when the input distribution of the uncertainties changes with the outer-loop iteration. We derive asymptotic formulae for the variance reduction of the meta estimators in the limit of convergence of the outer-loop applications. We demonstrate the meta estimators, using data-driven surrogates and biasing densities, on an uncertainty propagation problem from nuclear fusion, namely the estimation of energetic particle confinement statistics during a stellarator coil design optimization loop. The numerically measured speedups agree well with the asymptotic variance formulas. The meta estimators outperform all of their constituent variance reduction techniques alone, ultimately yielding two orders of magnitude speedup compared to standard Monte Carlo estimation at the same computational budget.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75247' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk140' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(140)' class='star'><span class='star140'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM (E105)</b> Linus Seelinger, UM-Bridge: Coupling Models and Methods for HPC-Scale Uncertainty Quantification <span id='bitlink-132'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(132)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-132' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(132)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>UM-Bridge: Coupling Models and Methods for HPC-Scale Uncertainty Quantification</b><br />Linus Seelinger<br />Friday, March 3 10:00 AM&ndash;10:15 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-31.html'>Multi-Fidelity Methods for Uncertainty Quantification and Optimization - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>We present UM-Bridge, a new, universal, language-agnostic interface for coupling uncertainty quantification (UQ) and model software.    
At the example of a parallelized multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MLMCMC) method inferring the source of a tsunami, we illustrate the numerous challenges to methods and software arising in UQ in high-performance computing (HPC) applications.  Our new interface addresses the technical challenges, making it easy to couple any UQ software to any model software. In addition, it massively simplifies both the UQ software for HPC-scale problems as well as the required parallel scaling of numerical model software by optionally leveraging modern cloud environments.    
Finally, we present a new library of UQ models and benchmarks based on UM-Bridge. It is easily accessible from virtually any programming language and provides portability and reproducible results through containerization.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75247' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk141' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(141)' class='star'><span class='star141'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM (E105)</b> Joakim Beck, A Goal-Oriented Adaptive Hierarchical Method for Random Elliptic PDEs <span id='bitlink-133'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(133)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-133' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(133)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Goal-Oriented Adaptive Hierarchical Method for Random Elliptic PDEs</b><br />Joakim Beck<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-31.html'>Multi-Fidelity Methods for Uncertainty Quantification and Optimization - Part I of II</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E105<br /><br /><small>This talk presents a goal-oriented adaptive hierarchical method for approximating deterministic, real-valued, bounded linear functionals that depend on the solution of a linear elliptic PDE with a lognormal coefficient field and geometric singularities in bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$.    
Our method adopts a hierarchy with its levels defined by a geometrically decreasing sequence of error tolerances; in contrast to standard multilevel methods, where a hierarchy is chosen based on mesh-element or time-stepping sizes. We use isoparametric d-linear quadrilateral finite element approximations. Consider a fixed error tolerance: for each realization of the random coefficient, we select an associated mesh from a sequence of deterministic, non-uniform auxiliary meshes determined by a goal-oriented adaptive algorithm based on a dual-weighted residual error representation.    
We demonstrate our approach for a random elliptic PDE problem with a geometric singularity similar to that at the tip of a slit modeling a crack.  The source of randomness is a lognormal coefficient field, based on a Fourier expansion with random coefficients. Our adaptive approach performs well for the lognormal case treated here, despite the lack of uniform coercivity that cause functional outputs to vary over orders of magnitude between outcomes.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimate 4.2 million deaths are linked annually to ambient air pollution. This issue having a huge impact on society leading to public measures of frustration such as current attempts by a group of citizens sue the German government over its lack of progress in meeting WHO recommendations on air quality levels presented in 2021. Understanding the key factors driving air pollution the combination of accurate pollution measurement techniques as well as detailed computational models of the underlying physical processes. The uncertainty in the model input leads to uncertainty in the model output. To quantify this uncertainty we use a Monte-Carlo (MC) approach based on      random samples from the input parameter PDFs. To improve the computational efficiency of the MC method we consider a range of multifidelity computational models and use a control variate approach to minimise the mean squared error of estimate of the mean of the model output. The classical control variate approach assumes known values for the means of the low fidelity models. In this talk we present results of techniques used to estimate these means and the optimal strategy of combining the multifidelity models.  	  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75247' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

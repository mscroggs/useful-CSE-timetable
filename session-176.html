<h2>Reliable and Efficient Methods for Coupled Problems in Porous Media - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk804' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(804)' class='star'><span class='star804'>&star;</span></a> <b>1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM (D404)</b> Nicola Castelletto, HPC Multiphysics Simulation of CO$_2$ Geological Storage <span id='bitlink-745'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(745)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-745' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(745)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>HPC Multiphysics Simulation of CO$_2$ Geological Storage</b><br />Nicola Castelletto<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-176.html'>Reliable and Efficient Methods for Coupled Problems in Porous Media - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Safe and efficient operation of CO$_2$ geological storage projects requires numerical simulation of a multi-physics problem in which compositional multiphase flow and transport are tightly coupled with the porous medium deformation. To simulate these processes, one needs to solve a set of coupled, nonlinear, time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the conservation of mass of each component and linear momentum of the solid-fluid mixture. We present a scalable fully-implicit framework based on a displacement/pressure/component density formulation. The discrete displacement field is approximated using nodal interpolation. Pressure and component densities are assumed cell-wise constant, with interface pressure also present if a hybridization strategy is chosen. A Newton-Krylov approach is used to advance the solution in time, with a finely-tuned multigrid reduction (MGR) preconditioner introduced to accelerate convergence. The solver is implemented in an open-source, exascale-compatible, research-oriented simulator for modeling fully coupled flow, transport and geomechanics in geological formations. Numerical results are presented to illustrate performance and robustness of the proposed solver on a variety of challenging test problems, including realistic field cases.

The models are prototype systems of dynamic poro- and thermoelasticty. Different formulations of the continuous model, including a first-order one in space and time, are studied. Well-posedness of solutions to the models in fitted functional analytical settings is reviewed. Tailored families of space-time finite element discretizations are analyzed for the representations of the continuous problem. For the solution of the algebraic equations, the efficiency of preconditioning GMRES iterations by V-cycle geometric multigrid methods is demonstrated numerically. Therein, higher order time discretizations, increasing the complexity of the block matrix structures, are focused.

Recently, motivated by the limitations of classical approaches such as the Reduced Basis method, many authors have been considering the use of neural networks and Deep Learning techniques for building non-intrusive ROMs.  We tackle the development of a constructive approach based on deep neural networks for the efficient approximation of the parameter-to-solution map of PDEs. Our work is based on the use of deep autoencoders, which we employ for encoding and decoding a high-fidelity approximation of the solution manifold. We study the expressivity of these deep neural networks with respect to the solution manifold and we present some results that illustrate the connection between the expressivity and the complexity of the networks. Furthermore, we discuss its generalization to PDEs involving complex domains, leveraging on the idea of sparsifying the network architecture by means of information about the topology of the computational mesh used for the full order model.   Finally, we present how these methodologies are applied to sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification of mathematical models for porous media such as Darcy flow in domains with fractures or channels.

Flow and transport are simulated using a finite volume Eulerian approach, while mixing and spreading processes are studied using a Lagrangian approach. This hybrid approach allows us to have an unprecedented look at the fine and larger scale processes that impact observations and interpretations from real column experiments. IN particular we are able to study the influence of boundary effects, which are typically neglected in current interpretations and develop rigorous theories that enable a more accurate interpretation of what is actually happening with the end goal of developing improved upscaled models that account for the full range of complexities that any real experiment will have. Additionally we have developed novel approaches for interface tracking through the porous column that provide an unprecedented view of mixing processes that are key to understanding and ultimately predicting mixing-driven reactions where current predictions either overestimate the amount of reaction or artificially and unphysical adjust reaction parameters to match observations, but at the cost of loss of generalization to other settings. Our novel numerical approaches and theories overcome many previous limitations that will benefit the world of scientific computing and experimentalists alike.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75475' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

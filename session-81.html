The objectives of FASTMath are to develop robust mathematical techniques and numerical algorithms to reliably address the challenges of large-scale simulation of complex physical phenomena; deliver highly performant software with strong software engineering to run efficiently and scalably on current and next-generation advanced computer architectures at the DOE Office of Science's major computing facilities; work closely with domain scientists to leverage our mathematical and machine learning expertise and deploy our software in large-scale modeling and simulation codes; and build and support the broader computational mathematics and computational science communities across the DOE complex.  In this talk, we briefly describe the SciDAC Program and the role that FASTMath plays, as well as some of the achievements FASTMath has made.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75339' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk365' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(365)' class='star'><span class='star365'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM (E103)</b> Carlo Graziani, Targeted Adaptive Design <span id='bitlink-335'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(335)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-335' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(335)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Targeted Adaptive Design</b><br />Carlo Graziani<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-81.html'>Optimization, Design, and Machine Learning in the FASTMath SciDAC-5 Institute - Part I of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Modern advanced manufacturing and advanced materials design often require searches of relatively high-dimensional process control parameter spaces for settings that result in optimal structure, property, and performance parameters. The mapping from the former to the latter must be determined from noisy experiments or from expensive simulations. We abstract this problem to a mathematical framework in which an unknown function from a control space to a design space must be ascertained by means of expensive noisy measurements, which locate optimal control settings generating desired design features within specified tolerances, with quantified uncertainty. We describe targeted adaptive design (TAD), a new algorithm that performs this optimal sampling task. TAD creates a Gaussian process surrogate model of the unknown mapping at each iterative stage, proposing a new batch of control settings to sample experimentally and optimizing the updated log-predictive likelihood of the target design. TAD either stops upon locating a solution with uncertainties that fit inside the tolerance box or uses a measure of expected future information to determine that the search space has been exhausted with no solution. TAD thus embodies the exploration-exploitation tension in a manner that recalls, but is essentially different from, Bayesian optimization and optimal experimental design.

ParMOO is designed to help engineers, practitioners, and optimization experts exploit available structures in how simulation outputs are used to formulate the objectives for a multiobjective optimization problem.  In this talk, we introduce our response surface modeling-based framework for building custom solvers and describe how this enables users to exploit a broad range of structures that commonly arise in multiobjective simulation optimization problems.  We then show how ParMOO implements this framework and some additional features that make this a practical and user-friendly solution.  ParMOO is pip- and conda-installable (package name: parmoo) and it's source code is publicly maintained on GitHub: github.com/parmoo/parmoo    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75339' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk367' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(367)' class='star'><span class='star367'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM (E103)</b> Christopher Brissette, Spectrum Aware Coarsening for Graph Partitioning <span id='bitlink-337'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(337)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-337' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(337)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Spectrum Aware Coarsening for Graph Partitioning</b><br />Christopher Brissette<br />Thursday, March 2 5:45 PM&ndash;6:00 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-81.html'>Optimization, Design, and Machine Learning in the FASTMath SciDAC-5 Institute - Part I of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />E103<br /><br /><small>Graph partitioning is a problem with applications in data mining, parallel computing, and scientific computing. For parallel computations, obtaining a balanced partition is desirable when distributing workloads. Unfortunately well studied methods such as spectral partitioning are too slow to be effective for this step at scale . For this reason, multilevel methods such as METIS coarsen the graph before performing spectral partitioning at the coarsest level and subsequently refining the partition. The quality of the partitions yielded from these multilevel methods tend to rely heavily on the quality of the coarsening. This quality is measured by how well the spectral cuts of the coarsened graph represent the true spectral cuts on the finest graph. We investigate the spectral approximation properties of different coarsening methods and implement these methods in parallel on GPU. We show that the spectral approximation properties of different coarsening algorithms vary significantly as do the quality of their output partitions.

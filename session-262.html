For elliptic problems, these deficiencies have recently been addressed by the introduction of oversampled RBF-FD methods that replace collocation with a solution procedure based on least squares. This has also facilitated the introduction of an unfitted version of the method that further reduced the constraints on node positioning and helped alleviate problems with skewed stencils near domain boundaries.    
In this talk an application of oversampled RBF-FD methods to problems in nonlinear solid mechanics will be presented, motivated by the desire to produce a meshless numerical model for the  human diaphragm.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75599' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1191' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1191)' class='star'><span class='star1191'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (D506)</b> Andriy Sokolov, A Parallel-in-Time Contour Integral Method for RBF-FD Discretizations <span id='bitlink-1102'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1102)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1102' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1102)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Parallel-in-Time Contour Integral Method for RBF-FD Discretizations</b><br />Andriy Sokolov<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-262.html'>Advances in Radial Basis Functions for Numerical Simulation - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>We study the numerical performance of the parallel-in-time contour integral method for one-dimensional differential equations of the reaction-diffusion-convection type. The method is based on the representation of a Dunford-Cauchy integral along a contour which encompasses the spectrum of an unbounded infinitesimal operator A corresponding to the equation. The discrete operator is constructed as a discretization of diffusion and advective, resp. convective terms by the Radial Basis Functions with generalized Finite Difference (RBF-FD) method. A contour is chosen to be of the elliptic shape with varying number of cubature points. Numerical performance of the contour integral method is compared with sequential-in-time realizations of the $\theta$-scheme. The studied algorithm is 2$N_{\textrm{time}}N_{\textrm{quad}}$ parallelizable, where $N_{\textrm{time}}$ is the number of time points at which the numerical solution is computed and $N_{\textrm{quad}}$ is the number of cubature points on the contour. The method is flexible with respect to the choice of a discretization method and can be extended to multiple dimensions. Corresponding numerical examples are demonstrated.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75599' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1192' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1192)' class='star'><span class='star1192'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (D506)</b> Davoud Mirzaei, A Non-Oscillatory Finite Volume Method Based on a Pointwise Smoothing RBF Approximation for Conservation Laws <span id='bitlink-1103'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1103)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1103' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1103)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>A Non-Oscillatory Finite Volume Method Based on a Pointwise Smoothing RBF Approximation for Conservation Laws</b><br />Davoud Mirzaei<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-262.html'>Advances in Radial Basis Functions for Numerical Simulation - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>One of the properties of a conservation law problem is that even if the initial condition is smooth the solution may evolve into a discontinuity or a sharp front. These discontinuities and sharp gradients result in non-physical oscillations in the numerical solution. The purpose of numerical methods is to precisely capture and suppress these oscillations while achieving a solution with a high order of convergence. There are several approaches but one of the most significant and commonly used is a class of essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) or weighted ENO (WENO) methods. The primary idea behind the ENO (or WENO) reconstruction is to determine a set of stencils surrounding a control volume, execute a reconstruction on each of these stencils, and finally pick up the smoothest (or a weighted) approximation as the desired reconstruction for that control volume. In this talk, we present an alternative approach which employs a single central stencil per any cell and suppresses oscillations by utilizing a new RBF approximate-interpolation method based on a pointwise smoothing approximation.          </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75599' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1193' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1193)' class='star'><span class='star1193'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (D506)</b> Benny Hon, Global-Local-Integration-Based Radial Basis Function Methods for Numerical Simulations <span id='bitlink-1104'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1104)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1104' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1104)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Global-Local-Integration-Based Radial Basis Function Methods for Numerical Simulations</b><br />Benny Hon<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-262.html'>Advances in Radial Basis Functions for Numerical Simulation - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>In this talk, the development in global, local, and integration-based meshless computational methods via the use of radial basis function (RBF) will be presented.  The local radial basis function computational method (LRBFCM) is an extension to solve large scale problems which has hindered the practical application of the global RBF method for years due to the ill-conditioning of its resultant full coefficient matrix. The LRBFCM has recently been applied to solve 2D cavity flows problems with free surface and some nonlocal diffusion and phase field problems.  The main idea of the integration-based radial basis function (FIM-RBF) method is to transform the original partial differential equation into an equivalent integral equation whose approximation can be sought by standard numerical integration techniques.  Due to the advantages of unconditional stability of numerical integration and spectral convergence of RBF approximation, the FIM-RBF method can solve boundary value problem under irregular domain with various kinds of stiffness. Recently, the FIM method has been generalized to solve multi-dimensional options pricing problems.  Numerical examples with sensitivity analysis will be given to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of these meshless computational methods.       </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75599' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1194' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1194)' class='star'><span class='star1194'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM (D506)</b> Martin Buhmann, Positive Definite Kernels on General Regular Domains <span id='bitlink-1105'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1105)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1105' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1105)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Positive Definite Kernels on General Regular Domains</b><br />Martin Buhmann<br />Wednesday, March 1 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-262.html'>Advances in Radial Basis Functions for Numerical Simulation - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />D506<br /><br /><small>Positive definite functions and kernels are an important tool for interpolation and approximation of functions in several dimensions. They give rise to well-defined interpolation problems and provide a variety of further approximation methods including, for example, quasi-interpolation and radial basis function approximation.     
In this paper we construct and analyse positive definite kernels on special domains; we study the kernel functions on a particular list of regular domains. The list includes the unit ball, conic surfaces, hyperbolic surfaces, solid hyperboloids, and simplices.

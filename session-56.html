<h2>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk254' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(254)' class='star'><span class='star254'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (G110)</b> Julian Koellermeier, Model Reduction Using Moment Models <span id='bitlink-236'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(236)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-236' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(236)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Model Reduction Using Moment Models</b><br />Julian Koellermeier<br />Thursday, March 2 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-56.html'>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>The high dimensionality of many mathematical models in science and engineering leads to prohibitively large computational cost for even an approximate numerical solution. However, an accurate solution of the full model is often not even necessary, as only a small set of variables suffices to characterize the main behavior of the solution. This poses the question of model reduction: How can we efficiently reduce the complexity of the model and arrive at a reduced model, that is both sufficiently accurate and computationally feasible?     
In this talk, we fist briefly discuss different model reduction techniques for kinetic equations. We then focus on moment models as one way to reduce the full model to a set of analytical, lower dimensional equations. The benefits of moment models are the mathematically sound derivation, their hierarchical structure, and the possibility to assess analytical properties of the model from the resulting equations.   We consider, among others, examples from rarefied gases and free-surface flows and illustrate those by numerical simulations.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75290' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk255' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(255)' class='star'><span class='star255'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (G110)</b> Katharina Kormann, Hybrid Low-Rank Discretization of the Vlasov Equation <span id='bitlink-237'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(237)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-237' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(237)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hybrid Low-Rank Discretization of the Vlasov Equation</b><br />Katharina Kormann<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-56.html'>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>The Vlasov-Maxwell system describes the evolution of the phase-space distribution of a plasma in its self-consistent fields. This kinetic description of a plasma is computationally very challenging due to the dimensionality of the phase space.   Low-rank solutions to the Vlasov-Maxwell equations have the potential to  compress the distribution function which enables a fast and accurate   solution. However, most simulations so far have been for relatively simple test cases which exhibit a strong low-rank structure.  Parallelizing low-rank solvers on a large scale is hard which hampers the applicability in state-of-the-art physics simulations. In joint work with Allmann-Rahn and Grauer, we have recently shown that more complex test cases can be tackled with a compression that is only confined to the velocity space. Another way of exploiting low-rank solutions in large-scale simulations    is to use a hybrid simulation that combines a low-rank solution with a particle-in-cell simulation. In this talk, we consider a particle-in-cell simulation with   a low-rank solution as a dynamic control variate. For benchmark test cases, it is shown that the low-rank control variate---in contrast to a time-independent   control variate---continues to improve on the accuracy of the particle solution when nonlinear effects become dominant.

The neutral particle behaviour is governed by a kinetic equation that is difficult to solve due to the high dimensionality of the phase space and the high collisionality between the neutral particles and the plasma. High dimensionality is typically resolved by resorting to Monte Carlo methods, but in high collisional regimes a pure Monte Carlo solver becomes intractable. To reduce the computational cost, recent research focuses on hybrid fluid/particle methods that exploit the high-collisionality of the system.    
In this talk, we elaborate on a new hybrid fluid/particle method that splits the particle distribution in two phases: a fluid phase and a particle phase. The particle phase is solved using a Monte Carlo scheme, the fluid phase follows a reduced fluid model that is derived from the kinetic equation in the high collisional limit. The two phases co-exist in the whole domain, but the amount of mass in each phase is determined by the local collisionality. This way, the amount of particles treated with Monte Carlo is reduced in high collisional regimes, where the cost of Monte Carlo is high, but the reduced fluid model is accurate. In low collisional regimes where the reduced fluid model is not accurate, but Monte Carlo is cheap, most of the mass is in the particle phase.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75290' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk257' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(257)' class='star'><span class='star257'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (G110)</b> Steffen Schotth&#246;fer, Regularized, Structure Preserving, Neural Network Based Entropy Closures for the Boltzmann Moment System <span id='bitlink-239'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(239)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-239' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(239)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Regularized, Structure Preserving, Neural Network Based Entropy Closures for the Boltzmann Moment System</b><br />Steffen Schotth&#246;fer<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-56.html'>Model Order Reduction Techniques for Kinetic Equations - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>The main challenge of large scale numerical simulation of radiation transport is the high memory and computation time requirements of discretization methods for the Boltzmann equation. In this work, we derive an approximation to the entropy closure method to accurately compute the solution of the multi-dimensional Boltzmann moment system with low memory footprint and competitive computational time. We extend structure preserving, neural network based approximations of the closure of the moment system to the context of regularized entropy closures. The main idea is to interpret structure preserving neural network approximations of  the regularized entropy closure as an two stage approximation to the original entropy closure. We conduct numerical analysis of this approximation and investigate optimal parameter choices. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the method has a much lower memory footprint than traditional methods with competitive computation times and simulation accuracy.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75290' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

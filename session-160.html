It is therefore desirable to study the separation process in order to understand the mechanisms involved and thereby optimise the separation process. In alkaline hydrogen PtX plants the separation of hydrogen from the lye requires tanks, which are costly, due to the large nickel content in the tank material, and also due to the large size of the tanks that is required for fast gas separation.A dynamic two-phase model is presented using the mimetic discretisation method. The gas-liquid flow is modelled by a Naiver-Stokes system of equations in an Eulerian representation. The motion of gas is modelled by a separate continuity equation.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75455' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk726' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(726)' class='star'><span class='star726'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (G106)</b> Mark Gerritsma, Dual Polynomial Spaces in Finite Element Methods <span id='bitlink-674'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(674)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-674' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(674)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Dual Polynomial Spaces in Finite Element Methods</b><br />Mark Gerritsma<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-160.html'>Geometric Mechanics Formulations and Associated Structure-Preserving Discretizations for Fluids - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G106<br /><br /><small>In this presentation we will introduce a sequence of finite dimensional function spaces for high order methods, which form a de Rham sequence. Vector operations like the gradient, curl and divergence in this representation take the particularly simple form of incidence matrices, which are very sparse matrices containing only $1$ and $-1$ as non-zero entries.    
The dual vector operations, in general, will not be sparse, topological matrices unless a de Rham sequence is constructed for the dual space. In this talk these dual spaces will be presented, yielding also highly sparse matrix representations for the dual vector operations. The mass matrices of the primal spaces serve as Riesz maps to switch between the primal and dual spaces. This construction immediately gives a representation for the trace spaces. These ideas are presented in [Jain, Zhang, Palha & Gerritsma, Construction and Application of Algebraic Dual Polynomial Representations for Finite Element Methods on Quadrilateral and Hexahedral Meshes, Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 95, 101-142, 2021].    
Time permitting, some examples of the approach will be given.

That is their dynamical equations can be obtained from an action principle or a Poisson bracket and a Hamiltonian functional, typically the total energy of the system.  Non-conservative problems are usually composed of a conservative (Lagrangian or Hamiltonian) and a dissipative part.  In both cases, it is important to preserve the structure of the conservative part in the course of discretisation in order to obtain stable numerical schemes that deliver accurate and reliable simulation results.    
We discuss Hamiltonian structure-preserving discretisation approaches based on high-order Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Methods (DGSEM). We show how these approaches relate to and generalise known energy-stable schemes based on split-forms and summation-by-parts properties.  The inviscid Burgers equation and the compressible Euler equations serve as main examples. Generalisations to other important fluid and plasma systems are sketched.    
A remarkable property of the proposed approach is that exact mass, momentum and energy conservation can be achieved even if the system of equations is not cast in conservative form and momentum and energy do not explicitly appear as variables.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75455' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk728' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(728)' class='star'><span class='star728'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (G106)</b> P.

The framework is based on the expression of the governing equations of either fluids or solids as the sum of three differential operators, namely an operator involving only the time derivatives of the unknown solution fields, an advection operator involving the first-order spatial derivatives and an elliptic operator involving the first- and second-order spatial derivatives.  A single formulation for both solids and fluids is obtained by a special expression of the elliptic operator.  High-order accuracy in space is achieved by discretizing these operators via suitably-introduced discontinuous Galerkin methods, which lead to block-structured mass matrices, enable a natural way to treat generally-shaped mesh elements, and are amenable to massive parallelization.  Numerical examples are provided to model fluids within the incompressibility regime, generally anisotropic solids and fluid-solid interaction problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75455' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

It emerges within mathematics but also in other scientific disciplines such as physics, chemistry, or engineering. The growing amount of research data challenges an old requirement in science: its reproducibility and the re-usability of results. In an attempt to answer this challenge at current level, the FAIR principles have been formulated. Yet, despite the existence of special solutions a comprehensive infrastructure for research data that supports the research process and implements the FAIR principles in science or in mathematics is missing. In 2020 Germany started the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) which will be created along the needs of all scientific disciplines and aims at FAIR use of research data. Within the NFDI the Mathematical Research Data Initiative (MaRDI) is the consortium for developing a research data infrastructure for mathematics. Starting with the areas of computer algebra, scientific computing, statistics and machine learning, MaRDI will develop standards for confirmable workflows and certifiable mathematical results and provide new services that assist the research cycle up to peer-review in the publication process. Standardized formats, data interoperability and application programming interfaces need to be established to ensure the ease of use of data across broad disciplines. In this talk, we present concepts and ideas behind MaRDI.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75530' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk987' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(987)' class='star'><span class='star987'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (G109)</b> Frank W&#252;bbeling, Building a Knowledge Graph for CSE: From Prototype to Community Project <span id='bitlink-910'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(910)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-910' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(910)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Building a Knowledge Graph for CSE: From Prototype to Community Project</b><br />Frank W&#252;bbeling<br />Thursday, March 2 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-216.html'>Interfaces, Workflows, and Knowledge Graphs for FAIR CSE - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Mathematical computing knowledge is produced at an immense, and seemingly ever   increasing, speed.   Very little of it is organised in meaningful ways, making its discovery,   insight and   discussion harder every year. Following new developments in a given field is   time consuming even for experts. Entering a new specialisation is daunting for   students.    
We will show how building a knowledge graph for scientific computing can   address   these issues.  We have created an ontology that  semantically links mathematical problems with algorithms, publications and   implementations.  This ontology encodes possible relationships between the entities in the graph   and these  connections can be explored using our web-based query frontend.  This query frontend enables non-experts to quickly gain an overview of   available methods and  software for numerical problems in their scientific work.  The frontend makes variations of essentially the same algorithms easily   discoverable.  It allows tracking new publications or software implementations connected to a   certain  mathematical problem.    
We will be inviting feedback for our plans to grow this knowledge graph into a   community-driven platform  with an open, freely accessible API.    
Our efforts are part of the scientific computing task area in the Mathematical   Research Data Initiative (MaRDI),   a consortium in the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI).

With the availability of meta-data and parameter-driven simulations, the demand for automated workflows to reproduce computational experiments across platforms has grown.     
In general, a computational workflow is defined as a step-by-step description for accomplishing a scientific objective, expressed in terms of tasks and their data dependencies. Characterized through their input-output relation, workflows are designed such that the associated meta-data can be used interchangeably and redundantly.     
As a part of the MaRDI consortium [www.mardi4nfdi.com] on research data management in numerical mathematics, we develop a novel computational framework that focuses on automation of abstracting meta-data embedded in an ontology of mathematical objects while negating the underlying execution and environment dependencies into multi-layered descriptions. Herein, we consider various computational experiments as case studies, and systematically incorporate them into our workflow tool and data provenance framework. Furthermore, we show how best to apply the FAIR principles to computational workflows, such that abstracted components are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable in nature. Going forward, we also plan to provide the developed FAIR CSE workflow in electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) with user-friendly guidelines.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75530' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk989' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(989)' class='star'><span class='star989'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (G109)</b> Bj&#246;rn Schembera, From Dark Data to Fair Data in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics <span id='bitlink-912'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(912)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-912' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(912)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>From Dark Data to Fair Data in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics</b><br />Bj&#246;rn Schembera<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-216.html'>Interfaces, Workflows, and Knowledge Graphs for FAIR CSE - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>Dark data are data that are poorly managed and they are becoming a major problem for science and industry. They are diametrically opposed to FAIR data because their epistemic status is unclear, and they are neither findable, accessible, interoperable, nor reusable. As such, research data may be uncurated, unavailable, unannotated, biased, or incomplete. The talk will explore representative examples of dark data in the fields of scientific computing and in statistics.  Dark data as a negative category serve well as an analytical tool to work out how the data management processes can be improved and aligned with the FAIR principles with respect to  reproducible research. This can be enabled by documenting epistemic metadata, i.e., information about the knowledge status of data. Epistemic metadata include, besides documenting pure process metadata, also the reflection and integration of scientific underpinnings of the research. This in turn means the evaluation of disciplinary scientific practices and conventions in detail. It is here that NFDI consortia, such as the Mathematical Research Data Initiative (MaRDI), can provide dedicated support by encouraging academic communities to engage in community-driven metadata standardization. In case of mathematics this means setting up semantic technology (metadata, ontologies, knowledge graphs) for problems, models, algorithms and software. The effort will be highlighted in the talk.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75530' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

The coupling library preCICE is a general purpose software framework, which couples simulation software stemming from different physical domains in order to simulate a global system behavior using the coupled solvers.  This talk deals with the inherent challenges arising due to the complexity of coupling different software interfaces employing different concepts as provided by each simulation software. A key aspect to cope with this complexity was the development of software-tailored adapter codes that bridge the gap between preCICE and the coupled application code. Nowadays, the preCICE ecosystem comprises several such adapter codes, corresponding tutorials as well as a broad documentation for each component. The variety of ready-to-use infrastructure in the preCICE ecosystem is one of the main reasons for a steadily growing and vibrant user community.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75531' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk991' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(991)' class='star'><span class='star991'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM (G109)</b> Pedro Costa Klein, Paving the Way for Open and Reproducible Research Within the CRC 1456 <span id='bitlink-914'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(914)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-914' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(914)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Paving the Way for Open and Reproducible Research Within the CRC 1456</b><br />Pedro Costa Klein<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-217.html'>Interfaces, Workflows, and Knowledge Graphs for FAIR CSE - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>We witness an era where unprecedented amounts of data are acquired in experimental research in the natural sciences. While new measurement techniques and instruments keep being devised and improved for inexpensive and efficient data acquisition, the current bottleneck is how to extract meaningful information from the resulting vast amounts of such measurements.  The DFG-funded Collaborative Research Center 1456 "Mathematics of Experiments" conducts research to improve mathematical tools for analyzing experimental data. In several subprojects between research groups from the natural sciences and mathematics, experiments and algorithms are developed, improved and analysed. Research activities in this field are very diverse which makes it challenging to define and ensure quality measures for good scientific practice in view of open research and reproducibility. In this talk, we present different actions undertaken as part of central efforts of the CRC's infrastructure project. This includes basic means such as infrastructure and training to ensure reproducibility, but also fostering scientific communication of research results through interactive documentations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75531' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk992' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(992)' class='star'><span class='star992'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM (G109)</b> Amir Ladhaar, Fairification of MSE Simulation Data with Application to Machine Learning <span id='bitlink-915'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(915)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-915' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(915)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fairification of MSE Simulation Data with Application to Machine Learning</b><br />Amir Ladhaar<br />Thursday, March 2 5:25 PM&ndash;5:40 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-217.html'>Interfaces, Workflows, and Knowledge Graphs for FAIR CSE - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />G109<br /><br /><small>The main targets of the Materials Science & Engineering (MSE) community are the characterization of materials and the study of the impact of materials processing and manufacturing to design materials with optimized properties. Laboratories develop and use different tools to generate data due to the vast number of different experimental, computational and analytical methods used in the MSE domain. Often, this myriad of tools does not follow standardized schemas and results in heterogeneous data when generated in different laboratories and even within the same laboratory. Heterogeneous data is difficult to exchange, reuse and process, resulting in uncoordinated MSE research. In the Data Analytics in Engineering group, we often store numerical results (e.g., homogenized stresses, stress fields, strain fields, plastic strains, ...) as a function of the loading. Description of the loading, its provenance, and authorship is quintessential to know. This information is important for machine learning tasks, however, metadata is usually missing in the produced datasets. Therefore, we need a common and complete description of the stored experimental results. Ontologies and knowledge graphs are state-of-the-art technology to enable such a unified data view. Thereby, we have designed and developed a knowledge graph; by using standardized World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) technologies and interfaces, the access to MSE experiment data enables compliance with the FAIR principles.

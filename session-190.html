<h2>Low-Rank Approximation-Based Approaches for Temporal Data Mining</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk869' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(869)' class='star'><span class='star869'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (D502)</b> Carla Schenker, Fusing Dynamic and Static Data Using Parafac2-Based Coupled Matrix and Tensor Factorizations <span id='bitlink-800'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(800)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-800' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(800)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Fusing Dynamic and Static Data Using Parafac2-Based Coupled Matrix and Tensor Factorizations</b><br />Carla Schenker<br />Wednesday, March 1 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-190.html'>Low-Rank Approximation-Based Approaches for Temporal Data Mining</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D502<br /><br /><small>There is an emerging need to jointly analyze time-evolving data sets together with static data in many areas such as social networks, omics data analysis, and temporal phenotyping. A promising approach in that direction is to jointly factorize data sets from multiple sources using coupled matrix and tensor factorizations. The PARAFAC2 model for tensor decompositions has been shown to be a promising alternative to the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model for temporal data due to its capability of capturing time-evolving patterns. While there have been studies using a PARAFAC2 model coupled with a matrix decomposition for joint analysis of dynamic and static data, they rely on implicit estimation of the evolving mode or a flexible PARAFAC2 constraint, and are therefore limited in terms of possible regularizations on the evolving mode. In this talk, we present a flexible algorithmic framework for joint factorization of dynamic and static data based on the PARAFAC2 model. It allows the PARAFAC2 model to be coupled to a matrix or a CP decomposition in any static mode.  The algorithmic framework utilizes Alternating Optimization with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers and facilitates the use of linear couplings and many different constraints on all modes, including the evolving mode in the PARAFAC2 model. In our framework, we allow for any proximable constraint, thus also enabling the use of time-aware constraints on the evolving mode.

With the availability of large amounts of network data, it is important to be able to reduce the networkâ€™s dimensionality and extract useful information from it. A key approach to network data reduction is community detection. Early work in graph-based community detection methods has focused on static networks. This type of networks is usually considered as an oversimplification as many real-world complex systems exhibit variation in their community structure over time. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop algorithms that detect the community structure and track its evolution across time. In this talk, we will present low-rank matrix and tensor decomposition methods for community detection in dynamic networks. The first part of the talk will focus on a low-rank + sparse model for evolutionary spectral clustering to detect and track the community structure in temporal weighted and binary networks. We will then extend this framework by considering a tensor formulation of the time-varying networks and introduce a low-rank tensor model to identify and track the community structure. The performance of the proposed methods will be illustrated on various benchmark network models as well as real networks from a variety of applications.

As tKGs dynamically evolves, the low-rank approximation embedding approaches should be empowered to capture temporal dynamics on tKGs. In this talk, we would like to introduce two approaches specified for tKG with two different perspectives. Firstly, the existing approaches model the tKGs in discrete state spaces while links on tKGs often vary continuously over time. To this end, we propose a novel continuum model by extending the idea of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to modeling tKGs. The proposed model preserves the continuous nature of dynamic multi-relational graph data and encodes both temporal and structural information into continuous-time dynamic embeddings. Secondly, tKGs often exhibit multiple simultaneous non-Euclidean structures. However, existing embedding approaches for temporal KGs typically learn entity representations and their dynamic evolution in Euclidean space, which might not capture such intrinsic structures very well. Thus, we propose DyERNIE, a non-Euclidean embedding approach that learns evolving entity representations in a product of Riemannian manifolds. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark tKG datasets, demonstrating the proposed methods' superior performance.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75496' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

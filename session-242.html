<h2>Improving Operator Splitting in Large Multiphysics Systems Including Global Climate - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1100' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1100)' class='star'><span class='star1100'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (D507)</b> Christopher J.

Those processes are partitioned into individual models that, along with the associated numerical discretization, are each developed more-or-less independently of the others, which has resulted in process coupling that remains essentially a sequential splitting approach. Thus, this work leverages a semi-discrete error analysis framework to investigate the potential both of alternative coupling approaches in the literature and of new coupling approaches developed specifically to the software architecture of the E3SM atmosphere model (EAM). The analysis framework isolates the coupling error from that of the temporal and spatial discretization, avoiding the need to rederive error terms for each combination of coupling approach and temporal and/or spatial discretization present in EAM. By leveraging such analysis, an alternative coupling approach for aerosol processes has been developed that substantially improves dust lifetime simulation, which is crucial to reliable climate prediction. Both the improvement in aerosol process coupling and the progress on improving coupling between other atmosphere processes will be presented.

The proposed strategy is applied to efficient DIRK methods  and the resulting combination is tested on a number of relevant test cases.  Furthermore, a general approach for the stability analysis of multirate methods  is presented, which allows to study stability on physically relevant linear model problems.    
Both results generalize previous work by the author and have been obtained  in joint work with   F. Casella (Politecnico di Milano), B. Bachmann (Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences), M. Gomez and S. Fernandez (University of Sevilla).

Since the two-dimensional barotropic system has a gravity-induced wave speed which is around two orders of magnitude faster than the three-dimensional advection-dominated baroclinic mode, numerical stability and model performance are strongly dependent on numerical methods solving the barotropic system. A scalable semi-implicit barotropic mode solver for the Model for Prediction Across Scale-Ocean (MPAS-O) has been implemented as a competitor of the default explicit-subcycling solver. The barotropic system is discretized in time with the Crank-Nicolson method. As a Krylov subspace solver, we use the single synchronization biconjugate gradient stabilized solver that has one global synchronization point per solver iteration. To accelerate the convergence of this solver, the restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner is introduced. Before the construction of the RAS preconditioning matrix, the global coefficient matrix is reordered to make a near-block diagonal form to obtain optimal performance. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that the semi-implicit barotropic mode solver has faster computational performance up to two times compared to the default solver while maintaining the numerical accuracy. Moreover, GPU acceleration of this semi-implicit solver is underway. We will briefly introduce this work at the minisymposium.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75567' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1103' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1103)' class='star'><span class='star1103'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (D507)</b> Ben Shipway, Operator Splitting in Physics-Dynamics Coupling of the Met Office LFRic Weather and Climate Model <span id='bitlink-1017'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1017)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1017' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1017)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Operator Splitting in Physics-Dynamics Coupling of the Met Office LFRic Weather and Climate Model</b><br />Ben Shipway<br />Thursday, March 2 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-242.html'>Improving Operator Splitting in Large Multiphysics Systems Including Global Climate - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>The UK Met Office provides weather forecasts and climate predictions at a range of timescales, for different domains of interest and at varying levels of complexity. Global deterministic model forecasts are currently carried out 4 times a day with $\sim$10km horizontal resolution, while more detailed short-to-medium-range regional forecasts over the UK are run more frequently using a 1.5km resolution. Seasonal and climate configurations use lower resolutions, but with additional complexity in the physics packages and coupling to ocean models.    
The challenges presented by future generations of computer architecture require a redesign of our software and algorithms, so the Met Office is developing LFRic - its next generation atmosphere model. To span the scales for weather and climate efficiently and accurately, a mixed-finite element non-hydrostatic dynamical core is used alongside finite volume transport and finite difference sub-grid physical parametrizations (e.g., solar radiation, clouds) all combined through a semi-implicit time-step.  Achieving greater levels of parallelism and more efficiently targeting spatial resolution will be a key feature to obtain efficient time-to-solution with the greatest level of accuracy.  We will discuss two aspects: accessing greater task parallelism through operator splitting in the semi-implicit timestep and refining/coarsening spatial resolution between different components (e.g., dynamical core, sub-grid physics) of the system.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75567' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1104' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1104)' class='star'><span class='star1104'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM (D507)</b> Katia Ait-Ameur, An Acoustic/Transport Splitting Method for the Isentropic Baer-Nunziato Two-Phase Flow Model <span id='bitlink-1018'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1018)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1018' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1018)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>An Acoustic/Transport Splitting Method for the Isentropic Baer-Nunziato Two-Phase Flow Model</b><br />Katia Ait-Ameur<br />Thursday, March 2 3:55 PM&ndash;4:10 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-242.html'>Improving Operator Splitting in Large Multiphysics Systems Including Global Climate - Part I of II</a> (2:35 PM&ndash;4:15 PM)<br />D507<br /><br /><small>We are interested in the computation of compressible two-phase flows with the isentropic Baer-Nunziato two-phase flow model [Baer and Nunziato. A two-phase mixture theory for the deflagration-to-detonation transition ({DDT}) in reactive granular materials.(1986)] by using a finite volume methods that decouples acoustic and transport phenomena. This approach is well-suited to many industrial applications like the simulation of flows in nuclear reactors when the material velocities are low compared to the sound velocities.    
For the Euler system, the classic Lagrange-Projection method allows to perform such decoupling by solving the flow equations in Lagrangian coordinates. Unfortunately, the Baer-Nunziato model involves three different material waves that do not allow to exhibit a simple expression of the system using Lagrangian coordinates.  Using similar ideas as in [Chalons, Kokh and Spillane. Large time-step numerical scheme for the seven-equation model of compressible two-phase flows.(2011)], we consider an operator splitting strategy that allows to separate an acoustic subsystem and a transport subsystem for the Baer-Nunziato model.    
This operator splitting allows to design a numerical scheme with a time-implicit treatment of the (fast) acoustic waves, in order to get rid of a too restrictive CFL condition, and an explicit treatment of the (slow) material waves in order to preserve accuracy, for the isentropic Baer-Nunziato model.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75567' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

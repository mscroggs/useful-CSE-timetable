The LB method is based on moments of the discrete velocity distribution functions, instead of the distribution functions.  The phase-field LB method is validated by simulations of a bubble without and with buoyancy force. In particular, the dynamics of an oscillating bubble due to its initial nonequilibrium shape and a rising bubble driven by buoyancy force are simulated to compare two methods quantitatively.  Simulations of the breakup of a rising bubble and the bubble interaction with a horizontal plate are used to quantify the efficacy and efficiency of the two methods. It is observed that the phase-field LBM is more dissipative due to the nature of the diffuse-interface method used to capture the interfaces. Overall, the results obtained from both methods agree well with each other when the effects due to the numerical artifacts intrinsic to the diffuse-interface method can be neglected. Also, the LBE method is in general far more efficient and easier to parallelized.

This limitation is overcome in numerous other approaches, of which we focus on the Shakhov and ellipsoidal statistics models. In this contribution, we address the implementation of these models in the spirit of the lattice Boltzmann approach, by discretizing the velocity space based on Gauss quadratures and replacing the equilibrium distribution by a truncated projection with respect to a set of orthogonal polynomials. We discuss an implicit-explicit implementation which allows the ideal hydrodynamics limit to be approached while keeping the time step finite.

We solve analytically a lattice Boltzmann model for planar channel flow to determine its deviatoric stress tensor. We find that the model contains an additional tangential stress, proportional to the square of the Knudsen number, that matches the stress in the Burnett equations. This additional stress has zero divergence, and hence does not affect the flow directly. However, the neglect of this additional stress by existing boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method triggers spurious oscillations in the computed solutions. We propose new Burnett stress boundary conditions and analyse them theoretically. We show that they completely eliminate the oscillations, and agree precisely with analytical solutions at second order in Knudsen number. We combine these Burnett stress conditions with Navier-Maxwell slip boundary conditions to study rarefied flows in microcavities. We show that our algorithm captures non-equilibrium effects in the pressure that are not captured by the Navier-Stokes equations. The results are in very good agreement with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions of the Boltzmann equation.

Some "magic" combinations of odd and even relaxation rates offer good qualitative properties, e.g. placing the point of zero tangential velocity exactly half-way between grid points at no-slip boundaries. We present a reformulation using relaxation rates for forwards- and backwards-propagating distributions. The "magic" combination then sets the forwards-propagating distributions to equilibrium. Applying this approach over three time levels eliminates all non-equilibrium contributions from neighboring grid points. We thus derive closed macroscopic evolution equations over three time levels for the fluid density and velocity alone. These discrete equations are naturally interpreted as discretisations of PDEs with second time derivatives. The evolution equation for velocity decomposes into a momentum conservation law, and a separate stress evolution equation that simulates a linear Maxwell fluid with finite stress relaxation. All other kinetic effects decouple. We also derive closed macroscopic boundary conditions from bounce-back boundary conditions. Numerical experiments with flows driven by oscillating walls, and by vortex dipoles colliding with walls, confirm that solutions computed with the underlying lattice Boltzmann scheme and the closed macroscopic finite difference scheme agree to within round-off error in 128-bit arithmetic.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75437' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

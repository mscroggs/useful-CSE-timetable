Recently there have been a number of attempts to speed up this process using neural networks.  Among these is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as surrogate models for CFD simulations with varying geometries; see, e.g., [1].  Here, the model is trained on images of high-fidelity simulation results. However, the generation of training data is expensive and this approach usually requires a large data set.  Thus, it is of interest to be able to train a CNN in the absence of abundant training data with the help of physical constraints.  First results have already been achieved for the heat equation on a fixed geometry and flow problems in parameterizable geometries; see [2, 3].  In this talk, we present a physics-aware approach to train CNNs as surrogate models for CFD simulations in varying geometries.  The employed CNN takes an imags of the geometry as input and returns images of the associated CFD simulation results, i.e., velocity and pressure, as output.  Our CNN architecture is based on the structure of U-Net \cite{RFB:2015:UNET}.  Since the model is trained on pixel images, it can be applied to a variety of different geometries.  We show results for two-dimensional flows around obstacles of varying size and placement and in non-rectangular geometries, esp. arteries and aneurysms.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75441' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk664' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(664)' class='star'><span class='star664'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:50 AM (E108)</b> Roberto Molinaro, Deep Fourier Neural Operator for Solving a Class of Inverse Problems <span id='bitlink-617'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(617)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-617' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(617)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Fourier Neural Operator for Solving a Class of Inverse Problems</b><br />Roberto Molinaro<br />Wednesday, March 1 10:25 AM&ndash;10:50 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-146.html'>Scientific Machine Learning and Data-Driven Techniques in Complex Multi-Physics Systems  - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E108<br /><br /><small>In the present work, we develop a model, named Deep Fourier Neural Operator, to learn the map from operators to functions. The model is employed in the contexts of inverse problem for partial differential equation with unknown function coefficients. In particular,  we aim at learning the underlying map from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, defined for a wide collection of boundary data, to the PDE coefficient. The use of this model is supported by rigorously proven statements demonstrating the uniqueness and well-posedness of such map. Moreover, we also present extensive numerical experiments to support the robustness and accuracy of the model.

We use the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator as an embedding layer, which allows us to encode geometrical information about domains with complicated shapes, e.g. with holes. We further demonstrate how to enforce Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions (BCs) exactly for the predicted PDE solution field. Our numerical experiments show that this can reduce training time and increase accuracy of the predicted solution compared to standard PINNs with Fourier Feature embedding.  Evolutional neural network (ENNs) use a time-stepping scheme based on the PDE residual to evolve the network parameters such that at each time step, the parameter state allows to predict the PDE solution. Our proposed modified PINNs eliminate the BC loss term and thus allow to extend this paradigm to more general geometries. We discuss how to efficiently implement the proposed numerical integration schemes and the challenges in balancing accuracy and computational time. Computational experiments on a parametrised time-dependent heat equation are conducted and results are compared with a classical PDE solver.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75441' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

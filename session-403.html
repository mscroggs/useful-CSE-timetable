Our methodology is integrated in the qualified industrial grade finite element solver for structural mechanics studies code$_$aster. As part of engineering design, engineers may perform repeated simulations for slightly differing configurations with different physical parameters or geometrical parameters (parametric study). Nevertheless, successive evaluations for nonlinear mechanical problems can entail prohibitive computational costs. We develop an adaptive algorithm based on a POD-Greedy strategy.  Since the operator is nonlinear, the computational complexity of the operator assembly scales with the size of the high-fidelity model. We develop an hyper-reduction strategy using an element-wise empirical quadrature in order to speed-up online assembly costs. We introduce a cost-efficient error indicator which relies on the reconstruction of the stress field by a Gappy-POD strategy, which can be used to drive the Greedy procedure. As an illustration and validation of our methodology, we provide namely numerical results on an elasto-plastic holed plate under traction, with physical variable parameters (strain hardening or elasticity coefficients).    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75883' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1831' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1831)' class='star'><span class='star1831'>&star;</span></a> <b>11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM (D304)</b> Rambod Mojgani, Discovery of Interpretable Structural Model Errors by Combining Bayesian Sparse Regression and Data Assimilation <span id='bitlink-1676'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1676)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1676' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1676)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Discovery of Interpretable Structural Model Errors by Combining Bayesian Sparse Regression and Data Assimilation</b><br />Rambod Mojgani<br />Friday, March 3 11:50 AM&ndash;12:05 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-403.html'>Data-Driven Dynamics and Model Reduction for Nonlinear Systems in Engineering</a> (11:30 AM&ndash;1:10 PM)<br />D304<br /><br /><small>We introduce MEDIA (Model Error Discovery with Interpretability and Data-Assimilation),  a framework designed to identify structural errors in models of nonlinear dynamical systems. While traditional calibration methods can reduce parametric uncertainties, it remains a challenge to deduce structural uncertainties from observations.    
We demonstrate the performance of our framework on a canonical prototype of geophysical turbulence, the two–level quasi–geostrophic system. A Bayesian sparsity–promoting regression  framework is used to select the relevant terms from a library of interpretable kernels. As calculating the library from noisy and sparse data (e.g., from observations) using conventional techniques leads to interpolation and numerical errors, here we propose using a coordinate-based multi–layer embedding to impute the sparse observations. We demonstrate the importance of alleviating spectral bias, especially with the multi–scale nature of turbulent flows, and show a random Fourier feature layer can sufficiently increase accuracy of the kernel terms to enable an accurate discovery. Our framework successfully identifies structural model errors due to linear and nonlinear processes (e.g., radiation, surface friction, advection), as well as misrepresented  orography.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75883' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1832' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1832)' class='star'><span class='star1832'>&star;</span></a> <b>12:10 AM&ndash;12:25 AM (D304)</b> Arvind T.

Deep learning is a popular approach, but they typically lack the strong physical constraints intrinsic in PDEs. Differentiable programming is an emerging paradigm that aims to enable the expressivity of neural networks inside PDEs, such that the learned model is intimately connected to the physics of the problem by construction. Recent efforts in differentiable programming have shown promise in learning accurate parameterizations from simulation data with known numerical properties. However, several earth/climate applications have incomplete or partially known PDEs that need non-intrusive parameterization from observational training data. This leads to a significantly challenging learning problem, where the strengths and weaknesses of differentiable programming are less known.  Furthermore, PDEs often exhibit chaotic non-local dynamics, which are harder to model than the local dynamics seen in several canonical PDEs. In this work, we systematically study differentiable programming-based strategies to learn such non-local dynamics by training neural networks embedded directly inside a non-local generalized Burgers system. In particular, we represent the nonlinear and non-local terms as neural networks and use backpropagation to train the equations while simultaneously solving the surrogate PDE in the forward pass. Additionally, we investigate the properties of the learned surrogate PDEs, including their sensitivity to system noise, external forcing, impact on prediction accuracy, and comment on potential applications. Our results show that differentiable programming as a paradigm can accurately model PDEs while surpassing vanilla neural networks. Interestingly, it succeeds even when strong assumptions are made about the missing physics while requiring lesser data and computational cost. However, we also discover that the problem specification and numerical methods employed have a non-trivial impact on the quality and stability of the learned surrogate model, with significant implications for various applications.

We start by addressing the numerical simulation of the mechanical wave propagation and induced displacements. This direct problem is the computational basis to solve the inverse problem which consists of determining the parameters that characterize the mechanical properties of the medium, knowing the displacement field for a given excitation. We formulate the inverse model problem as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, where the objective function measures the discrepancy between observations and predictions. We will discuss different strategies for learning the space varying elasticity coefficients, which include the use of neural networks. We report several computational results that illustrate the behavior of the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

We construct a cost functional using the data recorded at a grid of receivers in response to signals emitted by a set of sources. Next, we propose posible shapes and locations for the inclusions by topological energy techniques, which we parametrize in terms of a moderate number of parameters. Then, we implement constrained optimization schemes which decrease the cost starting from the selected initial guess and subject to wave equation constraints. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the method.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75380' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk479' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(479)' class='star'><span class='star479'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (G101)</b> Filippo Terragni, Data Processing and Reduced Order Modeling in Semiconductor Electron Transport <span id='bitlink-443'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(443)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-443' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(443)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data Processing and Reduced Order Modeling in Semiconductor Electron Transport</b><br />Filippo Terragni<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-106.html'>Shape and Size in Medicine, Biotechnology and Materials Science - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Self-sustained oscillations associated with electron transport in a single miniband semiconductor superlattice are analyzed by means of efficient data processing techniques. The system is modeled by a drift-diffusion equation in one spatial dimension, which describes the temporal evolution of the scalar current density and the distributed electric field in the voltage-biased superlattice. Numerically computed data show that, for some parameter regimes, the dynamics become temporally periodic after a transient: a traveling solitary wave for the electric field cyclically moves from cathode to anode.    
The higher order dynamic mode decomposition is applied to uncover the broad frequency spectrum of the spatio-temporal dynamics driving the transport mechanisms. The purely decaying transient can be isolated from the attractor, which is approximated by considering snapshots in short time intervals. On the other hand, the pattern associated with the electric field traveling wave is further investigated by the spatio-temporal Koopman decomposition. The related dispersion diagram and an estimation of the overall propagation velocity are accurately recovered.    
Finally, the construction of a data-driven reduced order model of the physical system is illustrated. The outcome allows to fast simulate the dynamical response of the superlattice over a range of different configurations.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75380' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk480' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(480)' class='star'><span class='star480'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (G101)</b> Aurora Torrente, Band-Based Binary Indices for the Analysis of Gene Expression Data <span id='bitlink-444'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(444)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-444' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(444)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Band-Based Binary Indices for the Analysis of Gene Expression Data</b><br />Aurora Torrente<br />Wednesday, March 1 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-106.html'>Shape and Size in Medicine, Biotechnology and Materials Science - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>The statistical concept of depth induces an ordering from centre outwards in multivariate data. Most depth definitions are unfeasible for dimensions larger than three or four, but the Modified Band Depth (MBD) is a notable exception. It relates the centrality of each individual to its (partial) inclusion in all possible 'j-bands' formed by j distinct elements of the data set. We assess (dis)similarity between pairs of observations by accounting for such bands and constructing binary matrices associated to each pair. From these, contingency tables are calculated and used to derive standard similarity indices. Our approach is computationally efficient and can be applied to bands formed by any number of observations from the data set. We have evaluated the performance of several band-based similarity indices with respect to that of other classical distances in standard  tasks in a variety of high dimension, simulated and real gene expression data sets. Our experiments show the benefits of our technique, with some of the selected indices outperforming classical distances.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75380' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk481' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(481)' class='star'><span class='star481'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM (G101)</b> Fabian Schuhmann, The Same, But Different &#8211; Discovering Differences Between Neutrophil Elastase and Cathepsin G <span id='bitlink-445'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(445)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-445' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(445)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Same, But Different &#8211; Discovering Differences Between Neutrophil Elastase and Cathepsin G</b><br />Fabian Schuhmann<br />Wednesday, March 1 3:10 PM&ndash;3:25 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-106.html'>Shape and Size in Medicine, Biotechnology and Materials Science - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Although the general mechanism for serine protease catalysis is well established, some questions still remain. For instance, the two enzymes, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, have a lot of structural resemblances; however, elastase degrades virulence factors, while cathepsin G does not. But their crystal structures are remarkably similar. Molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to study the two enzymes in solvent and probe their conformational differences.    
The two protein structures do not have the same number of residues, which renders the measurement of the similarity over the duration of simulations problematic. In order to tackle the problem, we established and implemented a three-step-protocol: The Fr√©chet distance is used to superimpose the two protein structures, such that only internal motions will be probed in subsequent steps. The dynamic time warping algorithm and its penalty matrix is used to generate suitable pairs of amino acids between the two proteins. Lastly, a symmetrized version of the so-called Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed to quantify the difference and similarities between the two protein dynamics trajectories.    
The approach showed a subtle difference in a specific residue in the two protein trajectories, which might explain the difference in specificity.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75380' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

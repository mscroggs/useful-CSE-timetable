A major drawback of this approach is that boundary conditions are not properly used to constrain the solution and the weighting factors in the objective function are problem specific and not known a priori. Additional complications arise when multi-fidelity observations are introduced into the objective function as well. To address these limitations in a principled fashion, we pursue equality constraint optimization to determine the parameters of neural networks. In our approach, we adopt the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to constrain PDE loss with its boundary conditions and any high-fidelity observations that may be available for the PDE at hand. Furthermore, we present a strategy to learn non-smooth solutions, where we introduce auxiliary parameters to reduce the order of differential operators and further constrain the solution.  We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our framework by applying it to several forward and inverse problems involving multi-dimensional PDEs. We achieve orders of magnitude improvements in accuracy levels in comparison with state-of-the-art physics-informed neural networks.

Unlike solving a linearized system that assumes infinitesimal perturbations around a base state, this framework considers nonlinear sensitivity equations (NLSE) for finite perturbations. To solve the NLSE, we propose a low-rank approximation that leverages a time-dependent basis by extracting correlations between sensitivities on-the-fly. To this end, we derive forward low-rank evolution equations for an orthonormal state basis, correlation matrix, and orthonormal parametric basis. The resulting equations are Jacobian-free and leverage the same nonlinear solver that is used to compute the evolution of the base state. To enable efficient computation of the low-rank equations, we employ a rank-adaptive sparse sampling strategy. This strategy constructs a low-rank approximation for the right hand side of the NLSE via the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Not only does this approach reduce the computational cost, it is significantly less intrusive as it does not require implementing the reduced operators term by term. For nonlinear sensitivities with arbitrarily time dependent base state, we demonstrate that low-rank structure often exists, and can be extracted in real time by solving evolution equations. We consider two case studies: (i) 2D compressible flow and (ii) species transport in a turbulent reacting flow.

In particular, we emphasize the process of  accomplishing true predictivity in a scalable setting. Dimension reduction approaches based on static manifolds - linear or non-linear - are not effective in predictive modeling of multi-scale problems with significant transport effects. To address this issue, we present an adaptive formulation in which the basis vectors and sampling points are adapted online using a novel non-local procedure. We compare and contrast adapting the basis to the solution manifold, and to the underlying PDE operator. Results are presented in a combustion dynamics problem involving compressible turbulence, reactions, and acoustics.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75855' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1753' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1753)' class='star'><span class='star1753'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (D304)</b> Phaedon S.

While several data-driven strategies for the construction of inexpensive surrogates have been proposed, their majority is hampered by the following difficulties:    
 -  they rely on a large, training dataset of input-output pairs which in turn  implies a significant computational cost.   -  the inputs for which training data is generated are decided a priori without regard to their informational content in constructing the surrogate.   -  deterministic surrogates are mostly considered which cannot quantify predictive uncertainty, especially in out-of-distribution settings.    
We propose a fully probabilistic approach in which the governing PDE is treated as a source of virtual data which is inquired iteratively by considering appropriate weighted residuals. We formulate this as a Variational Inference optimization objective, the output of which is a fine-tuned, probabilistic surrogate. We  consider several variations of the main strategy and demonstrate its efficacy in a variety of problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75855' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

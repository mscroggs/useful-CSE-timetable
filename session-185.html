However, these learned models are imperfect representations of complex physical processes. The discrepancy between such models and the underlying truth may be amplified by outer loop analysis such as optimization. We present a novel approach to compute the sensitivity of optimization problems with respect to model discrepancy and use this information to improve the solution obtained using learned models. By posing a Bayesian inverse problem to calibrate the discrepancy, we compute a posterior discrepancy distribution and then propagate it through post-optimality sensitivities to compute a posterior distribution on the optimal solution.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75487' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk846' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(846)' class='star'><span class='star846'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (E104)</b> Elizabeth Qian, New Multifidelity Sobol Estimators for Large-Scale Multidisciplinary Systems: Application to the JW Space Telescope <span id='bitlink-780'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(780)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-780' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(780)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>New Multifidelity Sobol Estimators for Large-Scale Multidisciplinary Systems: Application to the JW Space Telescope</b><br />Elizabeth Qian<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-185.html'>Scientific Machine Learning to Enable Outer Loop Analysis - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Sobol global sensitivity indices quantify how uncertainty in model inputs contributes to uncertainty in the model output. Such sensitivity indices allow inputs to be ranked in importance and are typically computed using Monte Carlo estimation, but the many samples required for Monte Carlo to be sufficiently accurate can make this computation intractable when the model is expensive. This talk will present a multifidelity Monte Carlo approach to estimating Sobol indices that combines samples from both cheaper lower-fidelity models (e.g., models learned from data) and expensive high-fidelity models to achieve computational acceleration with accuracy guarantees. We present new multifidelity Sobol index estimators based on rank statistics that can estimate Sobol indices for all inputs from a single set of independent samples. This significantly reduces the cost of Sobol analysis when the number of inputs is large. The approach accelerates the computation time required for sensitivity analysis of the JW Space Telescope thermal models from more than two months to less than two days. This demonstrates the power of the multifidelity approach to make sensitivity analysis tractable for large-scale engineering systems in the real world.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75487' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk847' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(847)' class='star'><span class='star847'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (E104)</b> Nickolas Winovich, Data-Driven Control Strategies for PDE Environments Using Reinforcement Learning <span id='bitlink-781'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(781)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-781' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(781)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Data-Driven Control Strategies for PDE Environments Using Reinforcement Learning</b><br />Nickolas Winovich<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-185.html'>Scientific Machine Learning to Enable Outer Loop Analysis - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>The process of identifying optimal control policies plays a key role in a wide range of scientific applications.  While many complex systems can be modeled effectively with numerical methods, it is often difficult to determine the best strategy for interacting with such systems based on the forward model alone.  In this poster, we explore the potential for leveraging deep reinforcement learning algorithms to automate the decision-making process in the context of scientific applications.  In particular, we show that a proximal policy optimization algorithm can successfully identify a near-optimal strategy for positioning sinks within a simplified PDE model of contaminant flow.  The generality of the underlying learning scheme, along with the promising results from initial experiments, suggest that reinforcement learning may provide an effective framework for optimizing the decision-making process in a wide range of scientific applications.

The use of reinforcement learning techniques relying solely on input-output data has gained popularity in recent years with applications ranging from robotics to portfolio management, control of chaos and stabilization of fluid flows. However, the lack of uncertainty estimates and frequent failures to converge to an optimal control prevent its widespread use in practice.    
Our work focuses on leveraging optimal control theory concepts for Markov decision processes in view of analysis and design of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for the control of spatially distributed systems in an inherently stochastic setting. We use the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as a test case for the stabilization of absolute instability and the control of local convective instability from noisy measurements. Limitations of the framework arising from the lack of observability and controllability and their effect on the convergence to efficient control strategies are discussed.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75487' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

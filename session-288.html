However, in GPU-based architectures, where memory is often limited, only a modest number of recycling basis vectors can be stored locally. On the other hand computations involving  local data are very fast. We discuss a number of low or mixed precision algorithmic extensions as well as memory saving strategies to make recycling more effective on GPU-based architectures.      </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75646' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1306' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1306)' class='star'><span class='star1306'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:35 PM&ndash;2:50 PM (G110)</b> Patrick E.

They are highly nonlinear and exhibit  strong coupling between the electromagnetic and hydrodynamic variables,  especially for high Reynolds and coupling numbers.    
In this work, we present a scalable augmented Lagrangian preconditioner  for a finite element discretization of the single-fluid incompressible  viscoresistive MHD equations. For stationary problems, our solver  achieves robust performance with respect to the Reynolds and coupling  numbers in two dimensions and good results in three dimensions. We  extend our method to fully implicit methods for time-dependent problems  which we solve robustly in both two and three dimensions. Our approach  relies on specialized parameter-robust multigrid methods for the  hydrodynamic and electromagnetic blocks. The scheme ensures exactly  divergence-free approximations of both the velocity and the magnetic  field up to solver tolerances.    
We confirm the robustness of our solver by numerical experiments in  which we consider fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers and coupling  numbers up to 10,000 for stationary problems and up to 100,000 for  transient problems in two and three dimensions.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75646' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1307' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1307)' class='star'><span class='star1307'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM (G110)</b> Yan-Fei Xiang, Hybridization of Machine Learning and Numerical Linear Algebra Techniques for Scientific Computing: Learned Minimum Residual Solvers for the Helmholtz Equations <span id='bitlink-1207'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1207)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1207' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1207)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hybridization of Machine Learning and Numerical Linear Algebra Techniques for Scientific Computing: Learned Minimum Residual Solvers for the Helmholtz Equations</b><br />Yan-Fei Xiang<br />Tuesday, February 28 2:55 PM&ndash;3:10 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-288.html'>Advances in Large-Scale Solvers in Computational Science and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>In the recent years, research on scientific machine learning based on deep learning solvers has been increasingly applied to scientific computing and computational engineering. However, even though these newly data-driven deep learning solvers could be very effective as soon as they have been properly trained, they can (in general) provide us with a solution of limited accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost in the training phase can be extremely expensive. In this talk, we presents some ways of hybridizing the newly emerging deep learning solvers and the more traditional numerical linear algebra techniques to let them benefit from each other. In the context of solving a 2D heterogeneous Helmholtz equation, we first focus on introducing some mathematical ingredients from classical iterative solver into the training phase of a recently proposed deep neural network solver. The main benefit is a significant improvement in the training phase that is more robust and faster, which turns out to be applicable to the testing process as well. Furthermore, once the network solvers have been properly trained, their inferences can be applied as a nonlinear preconditioner in the traditional flexible GMRES and flexible FOM methods. This part demonstrates that these hybrid variants have clear advantages over both the newly emerging deep neural network approach and the classical iterative Krylov solver in terms of both computational cost and accuracy of the computed solution.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75646' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1308' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1308)' class='star'><span class='star1308'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM (G110)</b> Kirk Soodhalter, Krylov Subspace Recycling for the Application of Matrix Functions <span id='bitlink-1208'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1208)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1208' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1208)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Krylov Subspace Recycling for the Application of Matrix Functions</b><br />Kirk Soodhalter<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:15 PM&ndash;3:30 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-288.html'>Advances in Large-Scale Solvers in Computational Science and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>We derive an augmented Krylov subspace method with subspace recycling for computing a sequence of matrix function applications on a set of vectors. The matrix is either fixed or changes as the sequence progresses. We assume consecutive matrices are closely related, but make no assumptions on the relationship between the vectors. This setting presents some unique challenges with regard to augmentation of Krylov subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a range of numerical experiments with a selection of functions and matrices.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75646' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1309' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1309)' class='star'><span class='star1309'>&star;</span></a> <b>3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM (G110)</b> Charles Parker, Robust Preconditioners for a High Order Finite Element Discretization of Planar Linear Elasticity <span id='bitlink-1209'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1209)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1209' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1209)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Robust Preconditioners for a High Order Finite Element Discretization of Planar Linear Elasticity</b><br />Charles Parker<br />Tuesday, February 28 3:35 PM&ndash;3:50 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-288.html'>Advances in Large-Scale Solvers in Computational Science and Engineering - Part II of II</a> (2:15 PM&ndash;3:55 PM)<br />G110<br /><br /><small>The discretization of the primal form of planar linear elasticity by high order continuous finite elements is known to be robust and locking-free in the incompressible limit. Recently, we showed that the stresses computed from the finite element solution are also robust and locking-free thanks to the uniform (in mesh size and polynomial degree) inf-sup stability of the Scott-Vogelius elements. Unfortunately, the condition number of the resulting linear system blows up in the incompressible limit, as the mesh is refined, and/or as the polynomial degree is increased. We present a family of preconditioners that control the growth of the condition number uniformly in the Lamé parameters, the mesh size, and the polynomial degree. The preconditioners are illustrated by applying them to the solution of a number of representative test problems. As a by-product of the analysis, we also obtain a preconditioner for the Morgan-Scott $C^1$-conforming finite element space that is uniform in the mesh size and polynomial degree.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75646' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

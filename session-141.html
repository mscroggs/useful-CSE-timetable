<h2>Reduced Order Methods for Geophysical Problems - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk641' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(641)' class='star'><span class='star641'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM (D404)</b> Siu Wun Cheung, Accelerating Hydrodynamics Simulations with Reduced Order Models <span id='bitlink-596'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(596)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-596' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(596)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Accelerating Hydrodynamics Simulations with Reduced Order Models</b><br />Siu Wun Cheung<br />Thursday, March 2 4:45 PM&ndash;5:00 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-141.html'>Reduced Order Methods for Geophysical Problems - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>Although many model reduction schemes have been developed to reduce the computational cost of simulations while minimizing the error introduced in the reduction process, there are challenges especially in nonlinear advection-dominated problems such as sharp gradients, moving shock fronts, and turbulence, which hinder those model reduction schemes from being practical. In this talk, we consider the time-dependent Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics in a moving Lagrangian frame, and demonstrate some novel techniques to address the challenges imposed by the advection-dominated solutions. Lagrangian hydrodynamics is formulated as a nonlinear problem, which requires a proper hyper-reduction technique to reduce the complexity due to the nonlinear terms in projection-based reduced order models. We will present various hyper-reduction techniques, including over-sampling DEIM and S-OPT. For reducing the Kolmogorov n-width of the solution manifold, we employ a manifold decomposition approach to build local reduced order models in submanifolds. We also present both a posteriori and a priori error bounds associated with the projection-based reduced order model, and the performance comparison of the reduced order modeling approaches in terms of accuracy and speed-up with respect to the corresponding full order model for several numerical examples, namely Sedov blast, Gresho vortices, Taylor-Green vortices, triple-point problem and Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75435' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk642' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(642)' class='star'><span class='star642'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM (D404)</b> Chenyu Dong, Dynamics of Weather and Climate on Reduced Manifolds <span id='bitlink-597'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(597)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-597' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(597)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Dynamics of Weather and Climate on Reduced Manifolds</b><br />Chenyu Dong<br />Thursday, March 2 5:05 PM&ndash;5:20 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-141.html'>Reduced Order Methods for Geophysical Problems - Part II of II</a> (4:45 PM&ndash;6:25 PM)<br />D404<br /><br /><small>While operational weather forecasting models have been dramatically improving over the past several decades, the prediction of weather extremes, within actionable time scales, remains elusive.

A framework that combines direct measurements and computational modeling techniques is therefore an important analytical tool, able to extract various insights from the collected statistics and open new strategies for mitigation policies.    
Since pollutant dispersion depends on daily weather conditions, CFD models with low time scales, repeated evaluation, and fine mesh discretization must be used. The former requirements translate into huge memory requirements, making it essential to use HPC facilities. However, the problem is suitable for the employment of Reduced Order Models (ROMs) to achieve fast converged solutions with limited loss of accuracy.    
For this reason, the present work consists of the exploration of a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) coupled with the Galerkin projection approach for the acceleration of external environmental flow problems.    
The evolution of the pollutant is described through the transport equation, where the convective field is given by the solution to the RANS equations, while the source term consists of an empirical time series.  Here we propose a data-driven approach based on a POD-NN reconstruction of the flux field, which is used to recover in a non-intrusive fashion the reduced-order operators required for the online evaluation.    
Our framework is validated on different scales and using real traffic measurements.

In paricular, we present a Local Proyection Stabilization (LPS) VMS-Smagorinsky model an the construction of the reduced basis spaces via the Greedy Algorithm.    
We construct the reduced velocity space by two different strategies, by considering or not the enrichment of the reduced velocity space with the so-called inner pressure supremizer. We present the development of an a posteriori error estimator for the snapshot selection through a Greedy algorithm, based on the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart (BRR) theory. Moreover, the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM) is considered for the approximation of the non-linear terms.    
Finally, we present some numerical tests in which we show an speedup on the computation of the reduced basis problem with the LPS pressure stabilisation, with respect to the method using pressure supremizers.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75435' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

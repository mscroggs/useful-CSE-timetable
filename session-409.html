Implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods treat these three terms with only two numerical methods, and this may not be desirable. Accordingly,  A recent approach that treat diffusion, reaction, and advection with separate methods was introduced in "[Raed Ali Mara'Beh, Raymond J. Spiteri, P. González, José M. Mantas,  "3-additive linear multi-step methods for diffusion-reaction-advection models",  Applied Numerical Mathematics,  volume 183, January 2023, Pages 15-38. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnum.2022.08.015.]". In this talk,  The construction of 3-additive linear multi-step methods for the solution of diffusion-reaction-advection systems is presented. The stability analysis and order of convergence of the new 3-additive methods are considered. A comparison between the new methods is with some popular IMEX methods in terms of stability and performance is presented. In general, It is found that the new 3-additive methods have larger stability regions than the IMEX methods tested in some cases and generally outperform in terms of computational efficiency.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77155' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1983' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1983)' class='star'><span class='star1983'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:40 AM&ndash;9:55 AM (E101)</b> Zamurat A.

The theory of Nyström was adopted in the derivation of the method. The formulation yielded an accurate RKNT method with reduced number of function evaluation thereby making it cost effective. The proposed method were tested with Numerical experiment to illustrate its efficiency and the method can be extended to solve higher order differential equations. The scheme is simple to implement and converges better with the exact solution.

In this talk, we discuss a framework for the development of exponential time differencing schemes for solving such systems. In particular, we present robust first, second, and third order accurate schemes.   Rather than imposing regularity requirements on the solution to account for the singularity caused by the fractional derivative, we only consider regularity requirements on the source term for preserving the optimal order of accuracy of the proposed schemes.  Optimal convergence rates are proved for both smooth and nonsmooth source terms using uniform and graded meshes, respectively.  For efficient implementation, high-order global Pad\'e approximations together with  their partial fraction decompositions are developed for Mittag-Leffler functions.   Numerical experiments involving a typical stiff system, and   other large systems obtained by spatial discretization of a sub-diffusion problem are typical examples to be discussed.  Demonstration of the efficiency of the rational approximation implementation technique and the constructed high-order schemes are to be illustrated.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77155' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1985' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1985)' class='star'><span class='star1985'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM (E101)</b> Andreas Sommer, IFDIFF - A Matlab Toolkit for ODEs with State-Dependent Switches <span id='bitlink-1820'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1820)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1820' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1820)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>IFDIFF - A Matlab Toolkit for ODEs with State-Dependent Switches</b><br />Andreas Sommer<br />Friday, March 3 10:20 AM&ndash;10:35 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-409.html'>Effective Methods for Time-Stepping and Solving ODEs</a> (9:20 AM&ndash;11:00 AM)<br />E101<br /><br /><small>We present the toolkit IFDIFF for integration and sensitivity generation in parameterized implicitly (state-dependent) switched ODEs whose right-hand side is given as Matlab code containing non-differentiable operators (max, abs, etc.) and conditionals (if).    
Naive implementations using IF-THEN-ELSE branching give unreliable simulation results without warning, as switching events are undetectable by standard integrators. The widespread belief that this can be countered using more stringent integration tolerances is wrong: We give a simple example where the integrator’s error estimation always delivers zero.    
Correct treatment of switched systems requires elaborate formulation of switching functions and tailored integrators, placing high mathematical demands on modelers. Even small model changes often imply considerable reformulation effort. Further, $n$ switches generate up to $2^n$ possible program flows and switching functions, rendering a-priori formulations not feasible already in medium-sized models.    
IFDIFF programmatically handles switching events, auto-generating only required switching functions. It determines switching times up to machine precision, and ensures accurate simulation and sensitivity results. Transparently extending the Matlab integrators (ode45, ode15s, etc.), IFDIFF is applicable to existing code with state- and parameter-dependent conditionals, thus enabling fast prototyping and relieving modelers of mathematical-technical effort.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=77155' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

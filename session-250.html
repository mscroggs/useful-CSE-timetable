<h2>Efficient Numerical Frameworks for Kinetic And Related Models - Part I of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1138' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1138)' class='star'><span class='star1138'>&star;</span></a> <b>9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM (D402)</b> Rostislav-Paul Wilhelm, The Numerical Flow Iteration for the Vlasov-Poisson Equation <span id='bitlink-1052'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1052)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1052' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1052)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>The Numerical Flow Iteration for the Vlasov-Poisson Equation</b><br />Rostislav-Paul Wilhelm<br />Thursday, March 2 9:45 AM&ndash;10:00 AM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-250.html'>Efficient Numerical Frameworks for Kinetic And Related Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>The Vlasov-Poisson equation is a high-dimensional partial differential equation used to model the behaviour   of plasmas in the collision-less limit. The six-dimensional phase-space and the turbulent motion of plasmas   together with formation of strong filamentation in the solution lead to significant complications in the   implementation of solvers. While purely Lagrangian schemes are in theory capable to capture the dynamics   correctly, the inherent numerical noise makes it hard to run long-time accurate simulations and requires   large numbers of particles as well as remeshing.   Eulerian and Semi-Lagrangian schemes produce more accurate results, however,   generation and management of meshes are prohibitively expensive for simulations in more than four dimensions.   In addition, when constructing high-order schemes one often looses conservation properties of the exact solution.    
We present a novel approach, the numerical flow iteration (NuFI), which iteratively reconstructs the phase flow   and then using the method of characteristics can evaluate the distribution function to arbitrary precision,   i.e., up to error in time and Poisson discretisation.   This approach naturally preserves non-negativity, does not struggle with over-shoots and conserves all $L^p$   norms exactly. From the implementation perspective, a high flop-byte ratio as well as a structure which allows   for easy parallelization of this method, lead to efficient portability to modern clusters.

K., Particle-in-cell charged-particle simulations, plus Monte Carlo collisions with neutral atoms, PIC-MCC. Trans. Plasma Sci., 19(2), 1991], which simulate the motion of a large number of computational particles, each of which represents a large number of actual molecules, atoms, or electrons.    
Particle-particle and particle-surface collisions in such codes are performed in a stochastic manner: a single process is simulated for each collision, with the process being randomly chosen based on the probability of it taking place. In the present work a new collision and boundary condition simulation scheme, dubbed "event splitting" [Oblapenko, G. et al, Hedging direct simulation Monte Carlo bets via event splitting, J. Comput. Phys., 466, 2022], is investigated. It simulates multiple events simultaneously via splitting of the particles involved in the collision and has been shown to significantly reduce the level of stochastic noise in unsteady breakdown simulations.    
The scheme is applied to 1-D modelling of discharges in rarefied argon and helium plasmas, and compared to standard PIC-DSMC collision routines in terms of computational efficiency and numerical noise.

A common approach to numerically solve it is the Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC).  The method is very efficient for high Knudsen numbers but becomes increasingly computationally intensive when approaching the continuum limit.  In this regime the Boltzmann equation can be numerically solved using the recently proposed kinetic Fokker-Planck method which, like DSMC, relies on simulated particles to transport mass, momentum and energy through the flow domain, but does not resolve individual collisions.    
While this approach has been extended to mixtures and diatonic gases, the modeling of chemical reactions remains a research topic.  Many problems arise from the fact that properties of the reactants need to be considered to evaluate a chemical reaction.  This contradicts the Fokker-Planck approach that achieves its linear scaling in terms of particle numbers by forgoing the creation of interaction pairs.    
In this paper we propose a novel approach to model chemical reactions in Fokker-Planck which aims to conserve mass, energy and momentum while retaining the performance advantages in areas of high density.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75576' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1141' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1141)' class='star'><span class='star1141'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (D402)</b> Satyvir Singh, Explicit Modal Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Vlasov-Poisson System <span id='bitlink-1055'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1055)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1055' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1055)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Explicit Modal Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Vlasov-Poisson System</b><br />Satyvir Singh<br />Thursday, March 2 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-250.html'>Efficient Numerical Frameworks for Kinetic And Related Models - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />D402<br /><br /><small>In plasma physics, the Vlasov-Poisson system characterizes the behavior of a collisionless plasma subject to electrostatic effects in terms of the corresponding distribution function in phase space. Due to high dimensionality (3D space + 3D velocity + 1D time) and their intrinsic physical properties (conservation and positivity), the construction of an efficient numerical method represents a challenge and requires a careful balance between accuracy and computational complexity.      
In this research, the development of a numerical method for solving the multi-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system is demonstrated. A modal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme based on rectangular/hexahedral meshes is employed for the numerical solution of the multi-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system. For the spatial discretization, the polynomial solutions are represented by scaled Legendre basis functions, and the numerical flux based on an upwind scheme is used for the solution stability. All the integrals appearing in the DG formulation are approximated with the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule. A third-order explicit SSP-RK-based temporal discretization scheme is used for the resulting semi-discrete ordinary differential equation. We study the convergence analysis of the proposed scheme. The performance of the proposed scheme is assessed by solving some benchmarks in the simulations of plasma physics, including two-stream instability, weak and strong Landau damping, etc.

Here, we investigate the utility of MPS methods for solving the Vlasov equation, a 6-dimensional nonlinear set of PDEs that provide an ab-initio description of collisionless plasmas. We report results of select test cases and demonstrate that we are able to capture important features of the dynamics even with significant amounts of compression.

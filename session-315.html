We will discuss broad challenges in these areas, both from the technical perspective (how different tools, techniques and better practices help) as well as from the social perspective (how do people/teams/communities that are made of personnel such as research software engineers (RSEs) help). This talk will inspire attendees to reflect on the roadblocks they face in their teams, organizations, and communities; how to realign our focus on meeting these challenges; and how to encourage culture change so as to build better scientific software.

However, it is very difficult to unlock to full computational power of the GPU. This is because there are many degrees of freedom in GPU programming, and typically only a handful of specific combinations of optimizations and parameter choices result in near-optimal performance. To obtain such highly-efficient kernels it is required to search vast and discontinuous program design spaces, which is infeasible for programmers to do by hand. Moreover, this search process would have to be repeated for different hardware and for different input problems, leading to productivity and sustainability issues with GPU applications. This talk gives a brief introduction to Kernel Tuner, a tool that allows programmers to create tunable applications that can be automatically optimized for any combination of hardware and input problems. Using run-time kernel selection and compilation based on auto-tuning results, programmers can create sustainable a pplications that can achieve near optimal performance on a wide variety of hardware and inputs.

This comes with an increase in importance for a sustainable and efficient development and development workflows and RSE practices to be applied for research software projects. An important cornerstone for the efficient and sustainable development of these are continuous integration and testing or similar techniques.    
Commonly available solutions rely on shared, public infrastructures and services. While these offer good accessibility and usability for many projects, they are not well suited for all demands of software targeting usage on HPC clusters. Such projects need to be developed, tested and verified with the targeted cluster, architecture and potential usage of accelerators in mind. In addition, infrastructure offering a stable and reliable environment, especially in terms of performance, are an essential component for deriving and comparing benchmark results in a continuous manner.    
For supporting research software projects targeting HPC clusters, an environment for a sustainable development, which offers a similar usage-experience as the previously mentioned services, needs to be adopted, integrated and offered on HPC clusters.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75705' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1431' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1431)' class='star'><span class='star1431'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:00 PM&ndash;5:15 PM (E104)</b> Damian W.

The open-source software under development in CLaSS includes the GASNet-EX networking middleware, the UPC++ partitioned global address space (PGAS) template library, the Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit), and the MetaHipMer metagenome assembler.  This talk will start with an overview of CLaSS software and the software sustainability practices commonly employed across the group.  The talk will then dive more deeply into the our burgeoning contributions to the ecosystem supporting modern Fortran, including our test development for the LLVM Flang Fortran compiler.   This presentation will demonstrate how agile software development techniques are helping to ensure robust front-end support for standard Fortran 2018 parallel programming features.  The talk will also present several key insights that inspired our design and development of the CoArray Fortran Framework of Efficient Interfaces to Network Environments (Caffeine) parallel runtime library, emphasizing the design choices that help to ensure sustainability.  Lastly, the talk will demonstrate the productivity benefits associated with the first Caffeine application in Motility Analysis of T-Cell Histories in Activation (Matcha).    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75705' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1432' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1432)' class='star'><span class='star1432'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM (E104)</b> Shyamali Mukherjee, Tools to Rapidly Develop Sophisticated HPC Software Libraries <span id='bitlink-1316'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1316)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1316' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1316)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Tools to Rapidly Develop Sophisticated HPC Software Libraries</b><br />Shyamali Mukherjee<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-315.html'>Towards Improvement of Sustainability and Productivity for Research Software - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />E104<br /><br /><small>Applications run on supercomputers having heterogeneous nodes require sophisticated HPC software libraries, e.g., Kokkos, VT, and these HPC software libraries provide intelligent capabilities involving, e.g., load balancing, resilience, support for performance profiling and support for debugging. These sophisticated HPC software libraries use sophisticated heuristics or AI to guide its decisions during application execution. For rapid development of such HPC software, tools – in particular low-level mechanisms that sit just above compiler and runtime for parallelization - need to be enhanced. In this talk, we first explain novel mechanisms implemented within MPIch and clang/LLVM OpenMP, specifically (1) tunable locality-sensitive loop scheduling for clang/LLVM's OpenMP and (2) the use of asynchronous communication through support for MPI continuations implemented in  OpenMPI. We provide theoretical analyses and show experimental results of these features’ to demonstrate the effectiveness of the features’ use within HPC software on current and future supercomputing platforms. Finally, we discuss how these features can be used as a tool within HPC software libraries enable rapid development sophisticated strategies within the libraries.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75705' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

Furthermore, the process of collecting data from a mechanical test and its ultimate utilization within a computational model calibration workflow are often loosely coupled. To address these issues, we propose an Interlaced Characterization and Calibration (ICC) paradigm that leverages concepts from Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) to actively drive an experiment that is tailored to the accurate calibration of a given material.    
In this talk we will provide an overview of the ICC concept and its application to elastoplastic constitutive models and share technical progress on a few of its key components. These topics will include the construction of surrogate model graphs that replace expensive computational simulations of the experiment and the &#8220;step selection' OED problem, i.e. given a set of choices for the next material state and current posterior distribution, which one should we choose?

Recently, data-driven modeling approaches have been proposed that aim to establish stress-evolution laws that avoid user-chosen functional forms by relying on machine learning algorithms.  However, these approaches not only require a significant amount of data but also need data of the full stress space and hence are in particular not suitable for small-data regimes.  In this talk, we discuss a hybrid framework that can work on a variable amount of data by relying on the modularity of the elastoplasticity formulation where each component of the model can be chosen to be either a classical phenomenological or a data-driven model depending on the amount of available information.  The method is tested on synthetic uniaxial data coming from simulations as well as cyclic experimental data of steels.  The obtained material models are found to not only interpolate well but also allow to  extrapolate in a thermodynamically consistent manner far outside the domain of the training data.  Training aspects and details about the implementation of these models into Finite-Element simulations are discussed and analyzed.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75276' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk228' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(228)' class='star'><span class='star228'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (G105)</b> Reese Jones, Machine Learning Constitutive Models of Inelastic Materials with Microstructure <span id='bitlink-212'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(212)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-212' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(212)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Machine Learning Constitutive Models of Inelastic Materials with Microstructure</b><br />Reese Jones<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-50.html'>Machine Learning for Computational Solid Mechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>Traditional simulations of complex physical processes, such as material deformation, are both crucial technologically and expensive computationally.   Furthermore the development of physical models via traditional methods is particularly time-consuming in human terms.  Developing comparably accurate models directly from data can enable rapid development of accurate models as well as more robust design, uncertainty quantification, and exhaustive structure-property exploration.  We have been developing neural network models that are guided by traditional constitutive theory, such as tensor function representation theorems to embed symmetries, and also exploiting deep learning to infer intrinsic microstructural features.  Neural networks are flexible since sub-components of their graph-like structure can be arranged to suit particular tasks, such as image processing and time integration, and represent the mechanistic flow of information.  This talk will describe the architectures and demonstrate the efficacy of neural networks designed to model the response of complex history-dependent materials with pores, inclusions or grains based solely on observable data.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75276' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk229' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(229)' class='star'><span class='star229'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (G105)</b> Nikolaos Bouklas, Modular Data-Driven Elastoplasticity <span id='bitlink-213'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(213)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-213' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(213)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Modular Data-Driven Elastoplasticity</b><br />Nikolaos Bouklas<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-50.html'>Machine Learning for Computational Solid Mechanics - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />G105<br /><br /><small>The development of highly accurate constitutive models for materials that undergo path-dependent processes continues to be a complex challenge in computational solid mechanics. Challenges arise both in considering the appropriate model assumptions and from the viewpoint of data availability, verification, and validation. Recently, data-driven modeling approaches have been proposed that aim to establish stress-evolution laws that avoid user-chosen functional forms by relying on machine learning algorithms. However, these approaches not only require a significant amount of data but also need data that probes the full stress space and also probes a variety of complex loading paths. In this work, we discuss a hybrid framework that can work on a variable amount of data by relying on the modularity of the elastoplasticity formulation where each component of the model can be chosen to be either a classical phenomenological or a data-driven model depending on the amount of available information.

Comparison of classical PINNs, variational PINNs (VPINNs) and variational energy based PINNs (VE-PINNs) to solve a simple 1D problem leads us to conclude that the variational approaches may be more accurate than the standards PINNs, whilst VPINNs is less straightforward to implement than VE-PINNs: leading to a preference for the latter. This is then deployed for the solution of more challenging phase-field problems in two dimensions and the performance is analysed in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Our conclusions suggest that, whilst accurate solutions are certainly achievable for this class of problem, further research is required to ensure the robustness and the generalization of the approach.  	    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75276' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

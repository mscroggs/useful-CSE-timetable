<h2>Problems and Solutions in 3-D Reconstruction - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1691' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1691)' class='star'><span class='star1691'>&star;</span></a> <b>1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM (G102)</b> Nir Sharon, Compactification of the Rigid Motions Group in Image Processing <span id='bitlink-1549'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1549)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1549' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1549)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Compactification of the Rigid Motions Group in Image Processing</b><br />Nir Sharon<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-374.html'>Problems and Solutions in 3-D Reconstruction - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Image processing problems in general, particularly in the field of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, often require considering images up to their rotations and translations. Such issues were tackled successfully for the case of rotations only, using quantities that are invariant to the action of rotations on images. However, extending these methods to cases involving translations is more complicated.     
This talk presents a computationally feasible and theoretically sound method of approximate invariant to the action of rotations and translations on images. Our approach allows one to reduce image processing problems to similar problems but over the sphere -- a compact domain acted on by the group of 3D rotations. We show that our invariant is induced by a family of deformed mappings, thereby compactifying the group structure of rotations and translations of the plane, i.e., the group of rigid motions, into the compact group of 3D rotations. Furthermore, we demonstrate its viability for image classification.

These operations become intractable for large scale structure-from-motion datasets. For pure permutation synchronization, the recent Cycle-Edge Message Passing (CEMP) framework suggests a memory-efficient and fast solution. Here we overcome the restriction of CEMP to compact groups and propose an improved algorithm, CEMP-Partial, for estimating the corruption levels of the observed partial permutations. It allows us to subsequently implement a nonconvex weighted projected power method without the need of spectral initialization. The resulting new PPS algorithm, MatchFAME (Fast, Accurate and Memory-Efficient Matching), only involves sparse matrix operations, and thus enjoys lower time and space complexities in comparison to previous PPS algorithms. We prove that under adversarial corruption, though without additive noise and with certain assumptions, CEMP-Partial is able to exactly classify corrupted and clean partial permutations. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy, speed and memory efficiency of our method on both synthetic and real datasets.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75820' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1694' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1694)' class='star'><span class='star1694'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (G102)</b> Dylan Green, Hierarchical Bayesian 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar Reconstruction Using Joint Sparsity <span id='bitlink-1551'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1551)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1551' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1551)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Hierarchical Bayesian 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar Reconstruction Using Joint Sparsity</b><br />Dylan Green<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-374.html'>Problems and Solutions in 3-D Reconstruction - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G102<br /><br /><small>Three-dimensional (3D) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is a burgeoning field of research with various applications in both military and civilian domains. Methods in compressive sensing and sparse reconstruction have proven to be effective in recovering highly resolved SAR images. These techniques provide a point estimate for the volumetric image. New research in the realm of Bayesian modeling has opened the door to quantifying uncertainty information in the image recovery. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian volumetric approach to reconstruct 3D SAR images from noisy SAR data as well as provide uncertainty quantification for two-dimensional projections of the volumetric image. We consider various metrics comparing our technique with similar point-estimation methods.

The issue is that registering high-intensity projections that exceed the dynamic range of the detector cause sensor saturation. While existing methods typically rely on the fusion of multiple exposures, we propose a one-shot computational imaging solution based on the novel Modulo Radon Transform (MRT). The MRT generalizes the conventional Radon Transform and is obtained via computing modulo of the line integral of a two-dimensional function at a given angle. In this way, the MRT encodes folded Radon projections and avoids information loss arising from saturation or clipping effects.    
In this talk, we rigorously introduce the Modulo Radon Transform and propose a sequential reconstruction algorithm for finitely many Modulo Radon projections, which is backed by mathematical guarantees. Our recovery strategy makes use of a property we call compact $\lambda$-exceedance, which is motivated by practice; in applications the object to be recovered is of finite extent and the measured quantity has approximately compact support. Our theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, where we report the reconstruction of target functions with Radon projections 1000-times larger in amplitude than the assumed modulo threshold.    
This talk is based on joint work with Ayush Bhandari (Imperial College London) and Felix Krahmer (Technical University Munich).  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75820' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

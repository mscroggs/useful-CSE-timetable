It is advantageous if such a framework stems from a simple and elegant general idea. Implicit constitutive theory of materials provides such a framework: while being built upon simple ideas, it is able to capture experimental observations with the minimum  number of physical quantities involved. It also provides theoretical justification in the full three-dimensional setting for various models that were previously proposed in an ad hoc manner. From the perspective of the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and corresponding numerical methods, implicit constitutive theory leads to new classes of challenging mathematical problems. After introducing the basic concepts of implicit constitutive theory, established by K.R. Rajagopal twenty years ago, we provide an overview of its main achievements in modeling and the analysis of corresponding problems.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75550' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1040' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1040)' class='star'><span class='star1040'>&star;</span></a> <b>4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM (D508)</b> Erika Maringova, On Mathematical Foundations for Implicitly Constituted Fluids with Implicitly Constituted Boundary Conditions <span id='bitlink-958'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(958)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-958' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(958)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>On Mathematical Foundations for Implicitly Constituted Fluids with Implicitly Constituted Boundary Conditions</b><br />Erika Maringova<br />Wednesday, March 1 4:20 PM&ndash;4:35 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-228.html'>Modeling and Computation for Implicitly Constituted Materials: Fluids, Solids, Plasmas, and Mixtures - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>We study systems of nonlinear partial differential equations of parabolic type, in which the elliptic operator is replaced by the first order divergence operator acting on a flux function, which is related to the spatial gradient of the unknown through an additional implicit equation. Formulating four conditions concerning the form of the implicit equation, we first show that these conditions describe a maximal monotone $p$-coercive graph. We then establish the global-in-time and large-data existence of a (weak) solution and its uniqueness. The theory is tractable from the point of view of numerical approximations. For details, we refer to [1].

Given the importance of the Mullins effect, there have been many attempts to develop mathematical models describing the effect. However, most of available models focus exclusively on the mechanical response, and are restricted to the idealised isothermal setting. We lift the restriction to isothermal processes, and we propose a full thermodynamic framework for a class of phenomenological models of Mullins effect. In particular, we identify energy storage mechanisms (Helmholtz free energy) and entropy production mechanisms that on the level of stress--strain relation lead to the idealised Mullins effect or to the Mullins effect with permanent strain. The models constructed within the proposed framework can be used in modelling of fully coupled thermo-mechanical processes, and the models are guaranteed to be consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.

The code features tools to easily mesh complex 3D microstructures, and a scheme for the addition of custom constitutive rules, allowing users to conduct sophisticated structure-property explorations.  The development team has recently added a crystal-plastic modeling capability to this tool, expanding its scope beyond divergence equations, but retaining the modularity and extensibility of the tool's architecture.  In addition, in partnership with machine-learning experts, we are now actively exploring means by which machine learning techniques might be used to construct high fidelity crystal-plastic surrogate models, compatible with the underlying finite-element technique. If successful, the result will be a very high performance modeling capability for a wide range of yielding systems, with high-fidelity meshes accurately capturing complex microstructures.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75550' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk2052' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(2052)' class='star'><span class='star2052'>&star;</span></a> <b>5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM (D508)</b> Aaron Baier-Reinio, High-Order Finite Element Schemes for the Stokes&#8211;Onsager&#8211;Stefan&#8211;Maxwell Equations <span id='bitlink-1877'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1877)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1877' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1877)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>High-Order Finite Element Schemes for the Stokes&#8211;Onsager&#8211;Stefan&#8211;Maxwell Equations</b><br />Aaron Baier-Reinio<br />Wednesday, March 1 5:20 PM&ndash;5:35 PM<br />This is the 5th talk in <a href='session-228.html'>Modeling and Computation for Implicitly Constituted Materials: Fluids, Solids, Plasmas, and Mixtures - Part I of II</a> (4:00 PM&ndash;5:40 PM)<br />D508<br /><br /><small>In this talk we consider the Stokes–Onsager–Stefan–Maxwell (SOSM) equations, which model the flow of concentrated mixtures of distinct chemical species in a common thermodynamic phase. The equations account for both the diffusive interactions between chemical species and the bulk convection. Our aim is to develop computationally efficient high-order finite element schemes that discretize these nonlinear equations in two and three spatial dimensions. Because the SOSM equations relate many unknown variables (e.g. the bulk and species velocities, pressure, concentrations, chemical potentials, etc.), this is a difficult task. In particular, there are many choices of which variables should be explicitly solved for in the formulation, and it is not clear which discrete finite element function spaces should be employed. To tackle this challenge, we derive a novel weak formulation of the SOSM problem in which the species mass fluxes are treated as unknowns. We show that this new formulation naturally leads to a large class of high-order finite element discretizations that are straightforward to implement and have desirable linear-algebraic properties. Moreover, from a theoretical standpoint, we are able to prove that when applied to a linearized version of the SOSM problem, the proposed finite element schemes are convergent. Our findings are illustrated with numerical experiments.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75550' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

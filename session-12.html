They are well-suited to find low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional systems and are a powerful tool in the creation of surrogate models but require an expensive offline training-phase.     
In addition, simulation models often consist of many degrees of freedom due to the modeling approach, but not due to the underlying requirements. Hence, they possess a higher resolution than necessary which leads to computational ballast. Accordingly, we propose to decrease the level of detail of the problem first to enable an efficient offline phase and hyperparameter tuning during training of AEs. Hereafter, a higher-detail surrogate model is built which is only refined in areas where necessary. For this, we use transfer-learning approaches to take advantage of already learned information.    
In detail, we work on down-sampled finite element models using mesh simplification. On a very coarse mesh, the first surrogate model is created using a graph convolutional autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron to capture the model's parameter dependencies. Based on its approximation quality, some areas are refined by replacing up-sampling matrices with adaptive up-sampling networks.  We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach on high-dimensional static as well as dynamic problems and compare it to classic AE-based MOR.   </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75203' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk53' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(53)' class='star'><span class='star53'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM (E107)</b> Maria Luisa Taccari, DeepOnet for Sub-Surface Flow Problems <span id='bitlink-53'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(53)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-53' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(53)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>DeepOnet for Sub-Surface Flow Problems</b><br />Maria Luisa Taccari<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:05 AM&ndash;10:20 AM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-12.html'>Neural Network Solvers for Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>Groundwater numerical models support the critical decision of issuing and reviewing permits such as water abstraction licences and enable forecasting the impact of land use and climate change on groundwater resources. They typically use control volumes (cells) for solving the discretized groundwater flow equation. As high spatial and temporal resolution are generally required, the use in supporting planning and mitigation policies is often limited by computational cost. In this work, we explore the use of neural operator surrogates to mitigate this expense. We address this challenge by learning the distribution of hydraulic head in a confined aquifer with one or multiple pumping wells, which act as forcing terms on Darcy's law. The heterogeneous aquifer is composed of various lenses of fine to medium sand, each with a different hydraulic conductivity. One or multiple wells are randomly placed in the domain and deep operator networks (DeepONet) learn the mapping from the hydraulic conductivity field and the forcing terms to the resulting groundwater head. Several application examples are deployed here with the aim of revealing how to best formulate the learning tasks for constructing a computationally inexpensive emulator for the steady-state and transient solutions of heterogeneous aquifers.     </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75203' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk55' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(55)' class='star'><span class='star55'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM (E107)</b> Vivek Oommen, Combining Autoencoders with DeepONet&#160; for Applications in Materials Processing and Climate <span id='bitlink-54'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(54)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-54' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(54)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Combining Autoencoders with DeepONet&#160; for Applications in Materials Processing and Climate</b><br />Vivek Oommen<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:25 AM&ndash;10:40 AM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-12.html'>Neural Network Solvers for Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>Phase-field modeling is an effective but computationally expensive method for capturing the mesoscale morphological and microstructure evolution in materials. Similarly in climate modeling, high-fidelity E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model) simulations can resolve small flow structures but are very expensive. Hence, fast and generalizable surrogate models are needed to alleviate the cost of computationally taxing processes. The intrinsic discontinuous nature of the microstructures and the presence of high frequency features in climate prognostic variables make the training of the surrogate model cumbersome. In this study, we develop an algorithm that pairs a convolutional autoencoder with a deep neural operator (DeepONet) to learn the dynamic evolution of systems in a lower dimensional latent space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework through key examples in material science and climate modeling. For the first problem, we train the proposed model to learn the dynamic evolution of two-phase mixtures. The trained model is used to replace the high-fidelity simulation solver in interpolation tasks and is integrated with the numerical solver for accelerating extrapolation tasks. In the second problem, we train the model to predict corrections to the atmospheric states obtained by the coarse E3SM model. The trained model is able to forecast extreme events like hurricane and tropical cyclones and replaces the `nudging moduleâ€™ in the E3SM.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75203' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk52' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(52)' class='star'><span class='star52'>&star;</span></a> <b>10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM (E107)</b> Sanjay Choudhry, Nvidia Modulus: A Physics-Ml Framework for Industry Scale Science and Engineering Problems <span id='bitlink-52'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(52)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-52' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(52)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Nvidia Modulus: A Physics-Ml Framework for Industry Scale Science and Engineering Problems</b><br />Sanjay Choudhry<br />Tuesday, February 28 10:45 AM&ndash;11:00 AM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-12.html'>Neural Network Solvers for Differential Equations - Part I of II</a> (9:45 AM&ndash;11:25 AM)<br />E107<br /><br /><small>High fidelity simulations are quintessential in the science and engineering domain. Like many applications, Machine Learning and AI can enhance the current ISV solvers and custom codes used by the enterprises and research groups. Specifically Physics based Machine learning (Physics-ML) can usher in AI based acceleration while meeting the demands of high fidelity simulations. In this session, we present Nvidia Modulus, an open Physics-ML Framework for the science and engineering community to use for their research and leverage the work of other researchers working on the development of Physics-ML approaches like Neural operators, PINNs etc. Nvidia Modulus provides a customizable training and inference pipeline that is abstracted away, so domain experts can use simple python based APIs for solving their problems. In this session, you will learn about the work we have done so far in enabling the community and the resources you can use to get started on applying AI and Physics ML approaches to your use cases.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75203' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>

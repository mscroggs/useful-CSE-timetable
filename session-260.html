<h2>Reduced Order Modeling of Differential Equations Through Deep Learning Algorithms - Part II of II</h2><div class='index-talk' id='talk1182' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1182)' class='star'><span class='star1182'>&star;</span></a> <b>1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM (G101)</b> Joseph Bakarji, Discovering Reduced Order Models from Partial Measurements with Deep Delay Autoencoders <span id='bitlink-1093'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1093)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1093' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1093)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Discovering Reduced Order Models from Partial Measurements with Deep Delay Autoencoders</b><br />Joseph Bakarji<br />Monday, February 27 1:50 PM&ndash;2:05 PM<br />This is the 1st talk in <a href='session-260.html'>Reduced Order Modeling of Differential Equations Through Deep Learning Algorithms - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>A central challenge in data-driven model discovery is the presence of hidden, or latent, variables that are not directly measured but are dynamically important. We develop a deep latent-model autoencoder that simultaneously optimizes for a nonlinear transformation that projects the measurement data on an effective coordinate system and discovers a sparse differential equation governing the latent variable. Our approach is motivated by Takens' theorem which provides conditions for when it is possible to augment partial measurements with time delayed information, resulting in an attractor that is diffeomorphic to that of the original full-state system. We show that the proposed architecture can discover a coordinate transformation from the delay embedded space into a new space where it is possible to represent the dynamics in a sparse, closed form, differential equation.  Furthermore, we show how this architecture can be used for discovering reduced order models from given partial or full measurements of the system. We demonstrate this approach on the Lorenz, RÃ¶ssler, and Lotka-Volterra systems, learning dynamics from a single measurement variable. As a challenging example, we learn a Lorenz analogue from a single scalar variable extracted from a video of a chaotic waterwheel experiment. Finally, we discuss the limitations and robustness of the method and propose future research directions.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75596' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1183' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1183)' class='star'><span class='star1183'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM (G101)</b> Giorgio Gobat, Deep Learning-Based Reduced Order Modelling for the Real-Time Simulation of Steady-State Nonlinear Dynamics in Mems <span id='bitlink-1094'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1094)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1094' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1094)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Deep Learning-Based Reduced Order Modelling for the Real-Time Simulation of Steady-State Nonlinear Dynamics in Mems</b><br />Giorgio Gobat<br />Monday, February 27 2:10 PM&ndash;2:25 PM<br />This is the 2nd talk in <a href='session-260.html'>Reduced Order Modeling of Differential Equations Through Deep Learning Algorithms - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) represent essential components in high-end technology applications e.g., resonators and gyroscopes. The increasing performance demand in terms of lower power consumption and enhanced sensitivity requires performing nonlinear dynamic simulations that require adequate tools. MEMS designers can resort to standard full order simulation techniques such as the Finite Element (FE) Method, nevertheless, the high computational burden is limiting their practical usage. Reduced Order Models (ROMs) provide an appealing alternative to building reliable and efficient nonlinear dynamical models. In particular Data-Driven methods allow building a ROM starting from data and without acting intrusively in the reduction procedure itself. Most of these approaches aim at modelling the dynamic behaviour of general systems, i.e. transient and steady-state regimes. Despite the generality of these approaches, some properties typical of the steady-state regime e.g., periodicity are difficult to reproduce. In this contribution, we propose a technique that, through deep learning autoencoders and harmonic decomposition, allows building efficient and accurate ROMs for the steady state regime for resonating MEMS.  </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75596' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1184' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1184)' class='star'><span class='star1184'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM (G101)</b> Harshit Bansal, Non-Intrusive Physics-Informed Reduced Order Modelling of Multiscale Computational Mechanics Problems <span id='bitlink-1095'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1095)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1095' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1095)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>Non-Intrusive Physics-Informed Reduced Order Modelling of Multiscale Computational Mechanics Problems</b><br />Harshit Bansal<br />Monday, February 27 2:30 PM&ndash;2:45 PM<br />This is the 3rd talk in <a href='session-260.html'>Reduced Order Modeling of Differential Equations Through Deep Learning Algorithms - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Numerical methods for multiscale modelling and simulation require the solution of a micro-scale problem at every Gauss quadrature point of the macro-scale computational domain. This renders the computational costs associated with solving a non-linear forward problem to be exorbitant. Furthermore, while there exist intrusive and non-intrusive machine learning (ML) based hyper-reduction techniques, the corresponding offline and online training phase is inefficient. With state-of-the-art methods in mind, a numerical framework is needed that offers: (i) a significant improvement in the generalization accuracy for the unknown solution and the derived quantities when the full-order training data is limited, (ii) an efficient offline training phase in the sense that an improved sampling strategy is invoked to identify where to perform the full-order solve, and (iii) an offline- and online-efficient, physically consistent, non-intrusive affine decomposition and hyper-reduction technique. To this end, inspired from the reduced basis empirical quadrature procedure (RB-EQP) and scientific ML techniques, we develop a novel, non-intrusive numerical method, trained using pretraining and semi-supervised learning strategies, to efficiently and cheaply solve non-linear forward multiscale mechanics problems. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on a hyper elasticity and a coupled thermo-electro-mechanical problem in a multi-scale framework.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75596' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div><div class='index-talk' id='talk1185' style='display:block'><a href='javascript:toggle_star(1185)' class='star'><span class='star1185'>&star;</span></a> <b>2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM (G101)</b> Christophe Bonneville, GPLaSDI: Identifying Autoencoders Latent Space Dynamics with Gaussian Processes for Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Models <span id='bitlink-1096'><small><a href='javascript:show_bit(1096)'>&#x25BC; Show talk info &#x25BC;</a></small></span><span id='bit-1096' style='display:none'><small><a href='javascript:hide_bit(1096)'>&#x25B2; Hide talk info &#x25B2;</a></small><div style='padding:20px'><b>GPLaSDI: Identifying Autoencoders Latent Space Dynamics with Gaussian Processes for Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Models</b><br />Christophe Bonneville<br />Monday, February 27 2:50 PM&ndash;3:05 PM<br />This is the 4th talk in <a href='session-260.html'>Reduced Order Modeling of Differential Equations Through Deep Learning Algorithms - Part II of II</a> (1:50 PM&ndash;3:30 PM)<br />G101<br /><br /><small>Solving PDE numerically is challenging and computationally costly, which motivates the development of faster reduced order models (ROMs). In recent years, the advance in machine learning allows the development of novel non-linear projection methods, such as Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) [Fries W., He X., Choi Y., LaSDI: Parametric Latent Space Dynamics Identification, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering (2022)]. LaSDI maps full-order PDE solutions into a latent space using auto-encoders and learns the system of ODEs governing the latent space dynamics. Interpolating and solving the system of ODEs allows for fast ROM predictions by feeding the predicted latent dynamics into the decoder. In this talk, we present Gaussian-process-LaSDI (GPLaSDI). GPLaSDI improves LaSDI in two ways: First, it uses Gaussian processes to interpolate the coefficients of the learnt latent dynamics, which allows for quantifying the uncertainty over the ROM predictions. Second, it uses the uncertainty to pick next parameter point where additional ROM data is collected to improve accuracy. This allows us to apply GPLaSDI to problems without any known underlying governing equations, e.g., noisy experimental data. Our method can achieve up to a few thousand time speed up with minimal reliance on the full order solver, provides meaningful confidence intervals over its prediction, and does not require to know the governing PDE or have access to its residual.    </small><br /><br /><small><a href='https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75596' target='new'>More information on the conference website</a></small></div></span></div>
